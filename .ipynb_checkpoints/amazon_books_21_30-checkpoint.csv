The author has a great list of topics, of which he has little to no knowledge. The chapters graze over topics that may sound interesting, but then you read about his irrelevant personal examples, which often are complaints to how he\'s not given credit for his work or about his party days where he needed money to enjoy life and how thinking about money brought him more money. The examples are beyond useless and only create more space for this shallow thinking for the readers. For example, if you\'re trying to showcase the power of positive thinking, maybe don\'t use an example of getting more money, and focus on how they can cultivate happiness within themselves that don\'t require money or ""things"" to make them happy - a basic concept of cultivating happiness.Just an outright awful book on so many levels. The worst I\'ve read to date. If you\'re looking to truly shift your perspective on life and live a better, happier life, I\'d recommend reading something written by Om Swami, who has actually studied these topics and can provide lessons that are applicable in life for anyone, of any age, and any level of existing knowledge.Don\'t waste your time with King.\n\n', '\n\n  I bought this book a year ago and loved it! There’s so much wisdom packed in this book, it’s amazing. After reading it the first time I felt empowered and began increasing my vibe.As with everything I wanted more. So I read other books in this genre, but always returned to “Good Vibes Good Life.”  I honestly can say, this book covers so many things and is profound.In this year I’ve followed Vex King on IG and the content that he provides is so authentic—just like this book. I highly recommend and am giving it as gifts this Christmas.\n\n', ""\n\n  This book has been so life-changing. Thanks to Amazon I received the book before the guaranteed date, and I have read it multiple times since. Vex King's simplicity resonates allowing us to implement his thoughts on a daily basis.

I knew this finale would shatter my heart, I just didn't expect it to do so as throughly or as wickedly as this one did. This one is rough on the emotions for much of the book, so if you're looking for sunshine and happiness, this is the wrong series for you.That said, it's glorious. The book does not hold back in its heartbreaking ruthlessness, nor does it restrict on the action and majesty brought to its two main characters. Rielle in particular walks a truly dark path and I cringed at some of her actions. She is one of the most complex anti-heroes in the YA fantasy genre.As for Eliana, I adore her. Strong, powerful, determined, and inspiring, I rooted for her every chance I had. Even with all she'd been through, I could hardly believe at the power of her. Not just her magical abilities, but her character and drive.Of all the side characters, I felt Audric developed the most. He is just so good and sweet and brave and I ached for him every single time. Corien also became interesting and one of the most diabolical villains in the genre. I would have liked a lot more time with Simon since I have some serious questions for him and he left me quite conflicted!The action is top notch and ruthless. The story and arcs are amazing, though the first half of the book dragged out a bit for poor Eliana, who endured so much. I loved seeing more of the world and the creatures and the darkness that made it so compelling.This entire series is absolutely fantastic and I highly recommend one for anyone who wants a series packed with emotion, complex anti-heroes, and intense magic. It will leave you exhausted and fulfilled at the same time. I loved it!\n\n""]"

Thirteen years later, Vincent mysteriously disappears from the deck of a Neptune-Avramidis ship.Weaving together the lives of these characters, The Glass Hotel moves between the ship, the skyscrapers of Manhattan and the wilderness of remote British Columbia, painting a breathtaking picture of greed and guilt, fantasy and delusion, art and the ghosts of our pasts.

What did Vonnegut do after Slaughterhouse Five, his iconic masterpiece set in wartime Dresden? He produced book after book, all as good if not better than Slaughterhouse Five. He did not let the success of Slaughterhouse Five damper his creative energy. In Mandel’s case, Station Eleven, her fourth novel, was a blockbuster, translated into thirty-five languages. How could she top that success? Wasn’t Station Eleven the pinnacle of success for Mandel? It appears not. Like Vonnegut, I can see Mandel continuing to produce opus after opus without consideration of past successes. Mandel is not one to rest on her laurels. The Glass Hotel is as good if not better than Station Eleven although the comparison is difficult because The Glass Hotel is in an entirely different genre than Station Eleven. Station Eleven is a dystopian drama with a hopeful ending whereas The Glass Hotel is in a genre difficult to pinpoint. I’m not sure in what section of the bookstore this book belongs. Is it a crime drama, a thriller, a cautionary tale? It’s all of those and maybe more.In The Glass Hotel, Mandel taunts us with her masterful foretelling just as she did in her previous novels. Mandel has the ability to take us to a peak of intensity before laying down a seemingly random insight into the future leading us into a crescendo of resolution. In this novel Mandel weaves in and out of a metaphysical world that connects her characters in a web of intrigue and of consummate dissatisfaction. Most of her characters we might consider losers. Certainly, most of them are so bent on living a comfortable life that they are willing to invest all of themselves and their life savings in a Ponzi scheme run by a charming narcissist who convinces them that their lives and money are safe with him. Of course, they are mostly oblivious to the dangers involved in the kind of investment offered to them, but frankly, most of them are willing to turn a blind eye to the possibility of danger by the promise of wealth and glory. Some are not and become complicit themselves in the Ponzi. It was hard for me to relate to any of the characters although aspects of each of their personalities have attractive qualities suggesting that they are real humans engaged in real human activity. So, in fact, I could relate to all the characters in a limited sense.  Not all the characters in the book are Ponzi involved. The ones that aren’t are flawed in their own ways, but they are also on personal quests to find the peaceful life. By the end of the book we learn that all the characters, the ones that haven’t died, have adapted to their circumstances and carry on with life. I love the way Mandel grounds her characters in place yet lets them wander in and out of place, sometimes with unpleasant results, sometimes with a sense of inevitability. She includes a number of sub-plots in the development of her main plot yet they are all connected to the core of the novel and to the main characters. These sub-plots tell a rich story. I am particularly attracted to Olivia’s story. Maybe it’s because she is an artist struggling in a commercial and nasty world.I don’t want to give away any of the delicious story of The Glass Hotel, so I have avoided mentioning specific characters and their roles in the book. I leave you to discover those for yourselves.The Glass Hotel is a sensitive and essentially voyeuristic romp through the lives of a number of flawed characters, each with their own set of redeeming qualities, some more veiled than others. The way I judge any book I read, fiction or non-fiction is in my reluctance to put it down. I found The Glass Hotel difficult to put down. I read it well into the night, uncharacteristically for me, I can assure you of that!. I strongly recommend The Glass Hotel. It has superb plot development, a fascinating cast of sometimes endearing, sometimes despicable characters, and it is also a cautionary tale and a lesson in caveat emptor along with an exploration into the psychology of wishful thinking.

  From the number-one bestselling author of The Nightingale and The Great Alone comes a powerful American epic about love and heroism and hope, set during the Great Depression, a time when the country was in crisis and at war with itself, when millions were out of work and even the land seemed to have turned against them. “My land tells its story if you listen. The story of our family.”Texas, 1921.  A time of abundance.  The Great War is over, the bounty of the land is plentiful, and America is on the brink of a new and optimistic era.  But for Elsa Wolcott, deemed too old to marry in a time when marriage is a woman’s only option, the future seems bleak.  Until the night she meets Rafe Martinelli and decides to change the direction of her life.  With her reputation in ruin, there is only one respectable choice: marriage to a man she barely knows.By 1934, the world has changed; millions are out of work and drought has devastated the Great Plains. Farmers are fighting to keep their land and their livelihoods as crops fail and water dries up and the earth cracks open.  Dust storms roll relentlessly across the plains.  Everything on the Martinelli farm is dying, including Elsa’s tenuous marriage; each day is a desperate battle against nature and a fight to keep her children alive.In this uncertain and perilous time, Elsa—like so many of her neighbors—must make an agonizing choice: fight for the land she loves or leave it  behind and go west, to California, in search of a better life for her family.The Four Winds is a rich, sweeping novel that stunningly brings to life the Great Depression and the people who lived through it—the harsh realities that divided us as a nation and the enduring battle between the haves and the have-nots.  A testament to hope, resilience, and the strength of the human spirit to survive adversity, The Four Winds is an indelible portrait of America and the American dream, as seen through the eyes of one indomitable woman whose courage and sacrifice will come to define a generation.

It\'s all the same.""\n', '\nPerseverance\n']","['\n\n  I must admit that I am stranger to these type of pedastrian plot driven popular novels.  I loved the quasi historical fiction element of the Dust Bowl migration outling the classist inhumane treatment of migrants in their own  country.  This is despicable and although no where even close to the abomination  of slavery, we do get to see the areas where classism and racism have similarities.My problem with the novel is that is so simplistic. I suppose this author knows her audience and clearly it is not me.The portrayal of the Italian American family alerted me immediately to the many flaws in this novel. Italians living in rural farming communities were not buying imported olive and the other stereotypical Italian foods. This part is just silly. These imported products would not have been readily available.Also, the idea that Italian parents would disown a SON and prefer his ""white"" girlfriend who shows up pregnant, is again very silly. Anyone who knows anything about Italian sons knows that their mothers never reject them in favour of pregnant white girls. The next thing about this is the casting of Italians as another race using expressions of ""dark"" and ""olive skinned.""  Italians are members of the white race and although they were cast as different and discriminated against for their culture, they were still white.As for the ""communist"" labour organizers there is nothing out of the ordinary about this, but it interesting to see reviews about how offensive any reference to communism is to some readers. One must remember this is before the realizations about totalitarian governments were very different than true Marxism.Now for our heroine, she is an OK character. She sacrifices everything for her family and the majority of women understand that deep love of one\'s children that permeates and consumes our lives.Overall, I could not finish this repetitive novel. It seems the author who I see churns these types of books out for her legion of fans, also just rehashes the same chapters over and over. It\'s like each new chapter is just a rewritten summary of the one before it. I was astounded she gets away with this to be honest in her attempt to churn out 400 pages... I must also add that the bedroom  scene near the end where Jack wants the ""lights on"" so he can ""see her"" made me laugh out loud. So hokey.This book is an attempt to write a Harlequin romance version of Grapes of Wrath.\n\n', ""\n\n  I grew up with a Dad who lived through the dirty 30s in Saskatchewan, where there are a lot of similarities in terms of what the dust storms, etc., were like.  Everything described in this book in regard to the weather matches the stories he told me.  I also read the Grapes of Wrath many years ago and this book reminded me of that, in terms of illustrating the despair of the people.  I found this book to be just stunning.  I learned a great deal about the migrant workers in California at the time.  I thought that Elsa was one of the most powerful females I've read in a book in recent memory.  The author did a beautiful job of depicting how Elsa finally found her voice.  Every bit of this book was believable.  Every character was living and breathing and speaking in my mind's eye.  I could hardly put it down and stayed up late last night because I simply had to finish it.  Yes, the subject matter is filled with despair and hopelessness, however, there is a thread of hope and positivity and strength that runs through the whole thing and saves it from being a depressing read.  This is a book I will likely read again and I expect I will find even more depth in each character when I do.\n\n"", ""\n\n  This excellent book about the Dust Bowl and the Great Depression has taken me back to my grandmother's stories about the era. After one year of COVID-19, this book showed me how this period, tragic as it is, pales in comparison to what the greatest generation endured for more than a decade.\n\n"", '\n\n  ""Be Brave... or pretend to be. It\'s all the same.""This is one of my favourite quotes in this inspiring, touching and eloquently written novel by Kristin Hannah.Elsa pretended to be brave her entire life, was quiet and at times subdued, until she was faced with her children\'s survival, and their future. Then she realized that she was brave.I gave this novel 4 stars, although it touched me deeply, and I did shed multiple tears throughout the time it took me to read it. It was a depressing tale, that during these dire times today, made me feel the ultimate sadness; for the people during the depression, for the Oakies, and for those during today\'s epic tales of struggle and despair.""Hope has taught me to stand up and find my woman\'s voice even in this mans world.""Elsa\'s character was always afraid to step out of her comfort zone, to do the inexplicable and to live and love a mundane life because that was all she knew, or that she thought she knew.She is a character to be admired, and unlike any character that I have known Hannah to write. She depicted Elsa as a true heroine in every sense of the word, her struggles with being a wife, being a mother, and being a woman were written in such a way that you were sentenced to sit back and reflect on your own struggles.As usual the imagery associated with Hannah\'s writing was second to none, as was her character definition, because every character in this novel is ultimately unforgettable.Another great one from Kristin Hannah.Thank you for writing this novel.\n\n', '\n\n  Someone on Good Reads suggested this was their favorite book, I must admit it wasn’t my favorite , nor was it her best in my opinion. I believe books come to us when we need them and had I read this during a different time in my life it might have meant more to me. That being said, it was well written and taught us about a part of history I’d never read much about before. It teaches us about hardships and how that makes us better people, slowly and almost without us realizing it . Elsa was a warrior in so many ways.\n\n']"

Newly arrived to Birmingham, Alabama, Jane is a broke dog-walker in Thornfield Estates––a gated community full of McMansions, shiny SUVs, and bored housewives. The kind of place where no one will notice if Jane lifts the discarded tchotchkes and jewelry off the side tables of her well-heeled clients. Where no one will think to ask if Jane is her real name.But her luck changes when she meets Eddie Rochester. Recently widowed, Eddie is Thornfield Estates’ most mysterious resident. His wife, Bea, drowned in a boating accident with her best friend, their bodies lost to the deep. Jane can’t help but see an opportunity in Eddie––not only is he rich, brooding, and handsome, he could also offer her the kind of protection she’s always yearned for. Yet as Jane and Eddie fall for each other, Jane is increasingly haunted by the legend of Bea, an ambitious beauty with a rags-to-riches origin story, who launched a wildly successful southern lifestyle brand. How can she, plain Jane, ever measure up? And can she win Eddie’s heart before her past––or his––catches up to her?With delicious suspense, incisive wit, and a fresh, feminist sensibility, The Wife Upstairs flips the script on a timeless tale of forbidden romance, ill-advised attraction, and a wife who just won’t stay buried.

I think I need to step away from domestic suspense novels. Reading Harlan Coben novels, I loved that idea of every day people getting caught up in scary and suspenseful things. It becomes very relatable as you could be the protagonist in the story. With the success of ""Gone Girl"", the trend of twist endings and shock value have saturated most suspense novels. It either becomes formulaic with it ending this way or that way...or an implausible ending just to make it different. I feel like for me, it\'s more about the plot and characters and not just the twist and turns. I am still enjoying historical mysteries, romantic suspense and police procedural so it\'s not the mystery genre I am growing tired with. Sorry for the ramble, but this is just the baggage that is coming with me as I read this one. In the 23% I read of this novel, I did not get invested at all, so I decided to stop reading. With the Jane Eyre story, you sort of know where it\'s going and I just wanted to forward to when it\'s all new.***I received a complimentary copy of this ebook/audiobook from the publisher through NetGalley. Opinions expressed in this review are entirely my own.*** (\n\n', ""\n\n  Hmmm....I thought the premise was good, having taking some inspiration from Jane Eyre. I was curious to see what Hawkins had come up with.I found each and every character to be unlikable. Jane isn't a lead that earned any empathy from me at all. She's a conniving user, a thief and a fake, matching much of what she despises about the wealthy residents of Thornfield Estates. I'm okay with having no clear 'good' or redeeming character in a novel, but found the character development missed the mark for me as well. I never bought into the 'romance' between Jane and Eddie at all.Most of the story is told from Jane's point of view. Chapters from Bea do pique the reader/listener's curiosity. I do applaud Hawkins' manipulation of the reader/listener as we hear more from Bea. But again, it was somewhat predictable. I just, well I just expected more I think. More of a fresh story perhaps. The Wife Upstairs ended up being just an okay book for me. Still, this was a good listen while doing some quilting. I'm definitely in the minority on this book.St. Martin's chose to use multiple readers for this book - Emily Shaffer, Kirby Heyborne, Lauren Fortgang. They're all readers I have enjoyed previously and they all did a good job with this novel.\n\n""]"

I will preface this by saying that it wasn't my normal type of book. It wasn't thrilling, it didn't keep you on the edge of your seat. It was, however, very thought provoking. Matt Haig takes a very serious and prevlant issue in today's society - mental health- and centers and entire book around it. I found myself very curious about which life Nore would ultimately choose, if she would go back to her root life or whether she would choose any at all. There are so many possibilities in life, if we had only made a tiny or sometimes massive alteration in the choices we make. The book raised a lot of very interesting and relatable points about the regrets we all have in life, and while you may regret them, you ultimately regret what you think may have happened had you chosen a different path, not what could have happened. For example, if you regretted breaking up with an ex, what may have happened if you stayed. Your thoughts always tend towards the positive, but what if it hadn't been positive? Typically most people regret something, but no on truly knows what would have happened, positive or negative if you had chosen differently. This book makes you think in a way most fiction novels don't, and it teaches the reader a good life lesson... the choices you make, help shape you into the person you are... but those choices don't define who you are. You are whatever you want to be, and you are never trapped, sometimes it just feels that way. There is always a way out, and you matter. 🥰\n\n"", ""\n\n  Everyone should read this book.We've all wondered what our lives would be like had we made different decisions - now we can see what it would be like to live those lives.Matt Haig is a genius author who brings the reader so deep into the story that we feel a part of the story, and we likely were meant to be. Like I said, genius.I love all of Matt Haig's books, but other than The Truth Fairy (which I've given to my niece who's 7), this is my favourite of his books.Please read this book.

A beautifully written reminder to love life, all its' scars and blemishes.  A perfect time for the publication of this book of hope and rejuvenation! Thank you, Matt for coming into my life and lifting my soul! Xo‘To fear love is to fear life, and those who fear life are already three-parts dead’.\n\n"", '\n\n  The Midnight Library by Matt Haig is one of those books that really make you examine your existence as well as the choices you have made to get to where you are. Imagine there was a place where you could try another life you could have lived. A place where you could see how things would have been if you had made other choices. The question posed: What would you have done differently, if you had a chance to undo your regrets? This book is a mix of fiction and fantasy. It is written beautifully and is really touching. It’s lighthearted but also deeply moving and real. I felt every emotion while reading it. At the beginning of the book the main character gives up all hope in living only to discover through lessons learned along the way, that life is worth living. It taught me to be grateful of everything and everyone. It has easily become one of my favourite books of all time. I laughed, I cried, and I thoroughly enjoyed every bit of it.\n\n', '\n\n  This book was a great read and causes you to think about your own life path and the decisions made to get where you are. Really makes you realize that no version of life is ever perfect, and we need to appreciate what we have whenever possible.I thoroughly enjoyed this book and am going to be checking out other books by this author.\n\n', '\n\n  It was outlandish, creative, deeply moving, and just plain fun! You will be rooting for Nora to figure her life out!Books as portals? Yes please.\n\n', '\n\n  I loved the concept of Midnight Library. What if on the day of your death you could go back and see the lives you would have lived if only you had made certain choices differently. If you could fix your biggest, and smallest, regrets and see if you would have lived a happier more meaningful life. After losing her job and cat in the same day, a depressed Nora Seed gets this chance after chasing a bottle of antidepressants with one of wine.If you get past the stretch of imagination it takes to get you to the midnight library where Nora spends most of the book suspended between life and death you\'re in for an amazing book. A book about how the grass isn\'t always greener on the other side of the fence. And how the smallest changes in you and how you live your life can deeply impact those in your periphery. Like how no longer teaching piano to a young boy removes the last barrier keeping him from a life of mischief and crime. Or how not living in the house you reside in in your root life, being able to get meds for, and help take care of your aging neighbour means he ends up losing his independence and living in a nursing home.Haig writes a thought provoking novel about how all our decisions, big and small, have the grandest effects. And the choices we make about will truly make us happy. Making us answer for ourselves "" what is the best way to live"". And an underlying reminder that no matter how inconsequential we may think we are, we are all the difference to someone else.***TW: suicide, depression, overdose, death of a pet***\n\n']"

They’re marching to battle, and I’m the bargaining chip that will either douse the fire or spark a war.  At the heart of my fear, my worry, there’s him—Commander Rip.Known for his brutality on the battlefield, his viciousness is unsurpassed. But I know the truth about what he is.Fae.The betrayers. The murderers. The ones who nearly destroyed Orea, wiping out Seventh Kingdom in the process. Rip has power sizzling beneath this skin and glinting spikes down his spine. But his eyes—his eyes are the most compelling of all.When he turns those black eyes on me, I feel captive for an entirely different reason. I may be out of my cage, but I’m not free, not even close.In the game of kings and armies, I’m the gilded pawn.

The first book definitely sets you up to continue this journey. I loved reading to see what would happen next between Auren and Rip and the other characters. There were parts that I could do without but there would have definitely been things lost in the end if they had been taken out or written differently. I have never been a fan of being pulled away from the main character to a side character but I trust that Raven has a reason for focussing on these other characters and the information will be tied together in the end. I understand people’s dislike of how weak and “damsel in distress” Auren is but at the same time she has been hiding from the world and being kept captive and used for a decade of her life… I believe in the end, or I’m really hoping that she is starting a journey of self discovery that although may be too slow for some is necessary for the story.

The build up between the main character and the potential(?) love interest is a perfect slow burn that I look forward to in the next book of the series. I do want to warn readers if you don't like feeble minded female leads the main character of this story will absolutely enrage you. Getting to the final chapters of the book I was nearly going to stop reading, this is commendable to the author's writing because she means for it to do this to the readers, or at least I hope she does. I was getting flash backs to Twilight with the clear ridiculous red flags of controlling/abuse but unlike that series this author clearly was meaning to write it like this as part of the plot.

Wow! The series has so far been a binge read for me. I really can't put the books down and I'm not mad about it.

The worldbuilding also expands and some great new characters enter the series in book 2!For those who didn't relate to the heroine in book 1, we get to see more of the real Auren in Glint and she is easy to empathise with and like.

Auren can be quite daft which became frustrating. I realize she was manipulated but I hoped she’d realize how blind she’d been a lot earlier.

I liked it a lot more than Red Queen and I felt like the writing and craftsman ship has gotten better. You can tell Victoria Aveyard put a lot of love and care into this novel and it shows in the best ways. I am highly anticipating the upcoming sequel! I hope Victoria Aveyard gets writing as fast as she can because I can't wait to have it in my hands!\n\n"", ""\n\n  I usually enjoy fantasy but i couldn't get through this one. very slow paced. this was one of my most anticipated so I was really let down.\n\n"", '\n\n  Corayne is living the life of a pirate’s daughter, always searching for something she can’t seem to find. She very quickly gets what she asks for when she finds out that her unknown father was a very powerful man and, since his death, she is the only one of his bloodline remaining- a bloodline that is needed to save her world from a dark and deadly force. Along with a ragtag group of misfits (a squire who could never quite make it as a knight, an assassin eager for revenge, a bounty hunter, a sorceress, an Immortal and a counterfeiter) Corayne travels distant lands she only dreamed of, but now everything she knows and loves is on the line and she must be willing to risk it all.Victoria Aveyard returns to the YA fantasy world with her new novel, “Realm Breaker”. I was a fan of Aveyard’s previous “Red Queen” series, and was very excited to get my hands on this (LENGTHY!) novel.“Realm Breaker” very much had a “Game of Thrones” aspect to it, in that there are several ancient kingdoms at war for the crown, with knights, Royalty, Immortals, witches and a plain old normal protagonist, disowned by her father, with a “special gift”. Honestly, even the lands themselves reminded me of the various Kingdoms in the GOT series, and the “raised from the Dead” army was something right out of Martin’s fantasy world. Good thing for Aveyard- I’m a huge fan of Thrones, and George R.R. Martin.Corayne is exactly what you’d expect from a young, female protagonist. Desperate to find her place to fit in, she soon discovers that she (and only she) can save the entire world. Sure, it’s a trope that’s been done before (again and again), but it doesn’t make it any less entertaining.I enjoyed the characters in Aveyard’s novel, as she manages to make each and every one (good and evil alike!) show redeemable qualities. There is almost a constant stream of action, with swordplay, regular old fisticuffs and even fights on horseback (which led to death and harm of some horses, which I am NOT happy about!).Each chapter was narrated by one of the main characters, and it was clearly marked and identified. Corayne was the main narrator of course, but the majority of the others take their turns as well. Not only did this method bring more depth to Corayne’s journey and its importance, but it shed some light on the characters and lands that exist in this world, outside of Corayne’s own.Aveyard is obviously going to be continuing this journey with future novels, which the ending suggests, but there was also enough of a conclusion to be completely gratifying. With action-packed twists and fantastically quirky main characters, I am definitely looking forward to reading more of the “Realm Breaker” series.\n\n', ""\n\n  I really enjoyed the Red Queen series so I was very existed to read Victoria Aveyard's newest release! Realm Breaker is very different from Red Queen. It is a high fantasy story with multiple pov characters. It gave me Game of Thrones vibe. There has very well thought out and expansive world building and it's implied that there is this rich history to it. We also get chapters from different characters that are all interconnected and from different sides of the conflict. There's a squire, an immortal, an assassin, a queen, and the heir to kingdom. To me it read a lot more like high fantasy than ya which made it a little difficult to get into at first. It really started too pick up towards the middle to the end of the book. That being said not a whole lot happens in this first instalment. It's very much a setup for the next book. I'm interested to see how the story continues to play out and I hope that there are more chapters from Erida's point of view because she is by far my favourite character. So much so that I felt some of the other characters chapters dragged on or were unnecessary. I really excited to see how a certain relationship of her plays out.Overall 3.5 starsRecommend for high fantasy fans that enjoy rich world building and multi-pov stories\n\n""]"

  NEW YORK TIMES BESTSELLER From two-time Pulitzer Prize-winning author Colson Whitehead, a gloriously entertaining novel of heists, shakedowns and rip-offs set in Harlem in the 1960s.""Ray Carney was only slightly bent when it came to being crooked. . . .""To his customers and neighbours on 125th street, Carney is an upstanding salesman of reasonably priced furniture, making a life for himself and his family. He and his wife Elizabeth are expecting their second child, and if her parents on Striver's Row don't approve of him or their cramped apartment across from the subway tracks, it's still home.Few people know he descends from a line of uptown hoods and crooks, and that his façade of normalcy has more than a few cracks in it. Cracks that are getting bigger and bigger all the time. See, cash is tight, especially with all those installment-plan sofas, so if his cousin Freddie occasionally drops off the odd ring or necklace at the furniture store, Ray doesn't see the need to ask where it comes from. He knows a discreet jeweller downtown who also doesn't ask questions. Then Freddie falls in with a crew who plans to rob the Hotel Theresa--the ""Waldorf of Harlem""--and volunteers Ray's services as the fence. The heist doesn't go as planned; they rarely do, after all. Now Ray has to cater to a new clientele, one made up of shady cops on the take, vicious minions of the local crime lord and numerous other Harlem lowlifes.Thus begins the internal tussle between Ray the striver and Ray the crook. As Ray navigates this double life, he starts to see the truth about who actually pulls the strings in Harlem. Can Ray avoid getting killed, save his cousin and grab his share of the big score, all while maintaining his reputation as the go-to source for all your quality home furniture needs?Harlem Shuffle is driven by an ingeniously intricate plot that plays out in a beautifully recreated Harlem of the early 1960s. It's a family saga masquerading as a crime novel, a hilarious morality play, a social novel about race and power, and ultimately a love letter to Harlem. But mostly, it's a joy to read, another dazzling novel from the Pulitzer Prize- and National Book Award-winning Colson Whitehead.

They have a long history, most of it as best friends,  but his broken promises and rather misguided attempt to guide her toward her dreams have left them at odds and feeling like adversaries rather than friends. After years away, they are both in there home town again, but her stay is temporary, just until her grandmother heals from her hip replacement. A rather naughty, escape-artist pig serves to expedite their reunion, a reunion filled with fright induced anger and recriminations. Weston’s PTSD and status as a recovering alcoholic serve as reasons to keep his Shel at a distance, and his grumpy, prickly attitude help to get the job done. Being back home is bittersweet for Shel. Yes, she gets to spend quality time with her grandmother and brother, and reconnect with friends, but having Weston nearby is torture. She has never stopped loving him, even when he failed to keep his promise to write her while he is when in the army and basically ghosted her. She left home for her education and dream of a career in preserving history, but she still wants to know why he broke his promises and why they are now more like enemies than friends. Strange incidents and strangers as well as his mischievous pig who had a crush on Shel, keep nudging Weston and Shel toward each other. Weston is at war with his conscience and his need to protect Shel. The chemistry and history between them is hard to ignore and soon passion takes over. But he tells himself it is temporary, she is leaving and that they don’t have a future together. The strange incidents soon take a dangerous turn, and Shel and Weston are scrambling to protect loved ones and each other. Will these two take a chance on a happily ever after or will they suffer more heartbreak?I loved Weston and Shel. They are both strong-willed, stubborn, passionate and big-hearted. Their chemistry is over the top, combustible and impossible to ignore. Their story provides lots of steamy, passionate encounters and a beautiful, eternal love that both try very hard to deny right up until the moment they finally surrender to it.

Easier said than done, however.  West was a man haunted by his war experiences; certain he was damaged beyond redemption and resolved to keep Shel in the dark and at arm’s length.  Again, not so easily done.  As a couple, I enjoyed the ease of their connection, and the sizzling chemistry between them.  I quite loved Hercules – West’s 100 lb. pet pig.  His very human-like behaviour, intelligence and amusing interactions with Shel and West, was very entertaining.Overall, there’s plenty of action, drama and some violence, humour and flirty banter along with several steamy, explicit scenes.

I am in hog heaven.  I love pigs so this story reeled me in immediately.  As a young girl, Rachel was part of the 3 Musketeers with her brother Marty and the crush of her life, Weston.  He always knew the right things to say including his corny jokes when she was feeling down.  Weston was her champion, her Knight on a White Charger.  But he only saw her as Marty's kid sister.She was devastated when he went into the Army and left her wondering why he did not write her like he said he would.  Rachel moved on and left her small town determined to see her dreams come to fruition.  Many years later, she returns home to realize Weston is back.  When Weston sees Rachel, he is shocked to see how much she has grown both physically and mentally. He knows he cannot go back to how they were before. He is not the same person she remembers when they were younger.Their story is heart wrenching and will pull your emotions right out of your chest.  They both will not admit their true feelings for each other.

I’m definitely not ready to say goodbye to these characters for good, and I’m dying for more Emilia, Hawk and Wilder too! 😉🤞If you’re looking for a fast-paced, addictive, suspenseful read with twists and turns you won’t see coming, then I HIGHLY recommend this rh, enemies-to-lovers series! 🙌\n\n', '\n\n  OMG!

Not satisfying at all.\n\n', '\n\n  I read Patricia Cornwell\'s first Kay Scarpetta novel back in 1990 and was immediately hooked on the premise, characters and plotting. Fast forward to 2021. The 25th entry in this series, Autopsy, has just released.Now, I must admit, somewhere around the 20th book, I threw the towel on this series. The books seemed mired in extraneous detail and became repetitive. But...this blurb from the publisher had me more than a little curious....""In this relaunch of the electrifying, landmark #1 bestselling thriller series, chief medical examiner Dr. Kay Scarpetta hunts those responsible for two wildly divergent and chilling murders. Forensic pathologist Kay Scarpetta has come almost full circle, returning to Virginia as the chief medical examiner, the state where she launched her storied career.""And you know what? I really enjoyed it and am back on board with this series.The same cast of characters is present, Kay, her Secret Service forensic psychologist husband Benton, her niece Lucy and my personal favorite - Pete Marino. The relationship between Kay and Marino was contentious in the beginning of the series, but I\'m happy with where Cornwell has taken Marino in this latest. He\'s a valuable resource instead of being portrayed as a thorn in her side. However there is a new thorn in the side character. Kay has inherited a secretary who is loyal to her old boss and quite resentful of Kay. Kay has the same analytical mind. Cornwell keeps the characters moving forward in real time, with the successes and sadness that living life brings.The \'back to basics\' has Kay investigating the death of a young woman found on the railroad tracks. This crime very much reminded me of the earlier books. Political machinations and corruption abounds at a number of levels in this latest, stretching as far as outer space! Kay is called in to examine a remote site. There\'s yet another thread that I\'ll let you discover.I chose to listen to this latest. The reader was award winning narrator Susan Ericksen. She has read previous Scarpetta books, so the continuity is nice. Her voice is perfect for the mental image I\'ve created for Scarpetta. Her diction is clear, easy to understand, well enunciated and pleasant. The speed of speaking was a bit slow for me, so I sped things up two notches, using the speed adjuster on my device. She provides different voices for the characters, each easily identifiable. Ericksen conveys the emotions of the characters and the action and suspense of the plot with her voice. A great performance.I did find the ending a bit rushed and a slightly too pat, but I quite enjoyed this \'relaunch\' of this series. The door has been left open for number 26 - and I for one will be picking it up.\n\n', '\n\n  I’ve read all the Kay Scarpetta books and enjoyed all of them. This one was ok….I’m glad I read it but was disappointed with a few aspects. The part involving the space murders was awkward and really was completely unrelated to the rest of the plot. The idea that an autopsy could be done in that way was a bit science fiction. I’m glad Marino was back and not portrayed like an incompetent fool. The ending was very anti climactic. I was expecting a bigger mystery to be solved. More focus on her job and the solving of suspicious deaths makes for a better story line.\n\n']"

They were rich and complicated and had their own desires and needs. The romance built organically and I liked that it wasn't a simple will they/won't they, there were some real obstacles both emotionally and environmentally. But then they also knew how to have fun when it called for it (if you know what I mean)!It was also fun going back in time a bit to what Austen was like in the early tech boom. A fun setting for sure. And the juxtaposition of the business world and the faires allowed you to see different sides of the characters.Looking forward to book 2 in the series!\n\n""]"

Gray says it best in Author Seeking Mountain Man: ""Might give them a few tips on how to treat their ladies -- dirty in the sheets and like a goddess everywhere else."" Swoon.Author Seeking Mountain Man - Book 1. This is the story of Aster Hollingsworth, a well known romance writer who has lost her mojo, so she comes to Moose Mountain hoping to find some inspiration. When her rental car crashes during a freak snow storm, Aster is rescued by Gray Cooper, the oldest of the four brothers. With no way to get her down the mountain in the storm, Gray takes Aster back to his cabin. Aster finds her creative juices flowing when she comes to and realizes all of the story ideas spinning through her mind were based in reality when she takes one look at Gray - and he has been more than amused by her absent-minded muttering while she has been in and out of consciousness. As she recovers, the two find much more together than just inspiration for a new series of books.Introvert Seeking Mountain Man - Book 2. Jemma Scott arrives in Alaska in search of her missing boss, Aster. She has pre-arranged a mountain guide to assist her, and Cole Cooper is more than she was banking on - causing her to promptly faint in his arms. Cole just might be my favourite Cooper. He knows from the moment he performs ""mouth-to-mouth"" (with tongue) on Jemma that she is the woman the mountain has called to be his. But Jemma\'s inexperience and introversion causes her to lash out at him at every turn - which just turns Cooper on all the more. These two have chemistry in spades and are as entertaining as all get out.Fangirl Seeking Mountain Man - When Amy arrives in Woodward Valley for a readers\' retreat with Aster, Jemma and fellow fans of Aster\'s book series, she almost immediately walks into Boone Cooper as she is wandering in the quaint little town. Boone is the most skeptical of the Cooper brothers where the legend of the Mountain is concerned; however he is instantly drawn to the beautiful and quirky, vintage-dress wearing tourist. When they continue to cross paths, neither can deny the scorching chemistry between them. But will the skeptic let the Mountain\'s gift get away or will the sexy Sheriff recognize in time that he has met his (handcuff-loving) match?Hiker Seeking Mountain Man - Unlike the rest of his brothers, Brooks Cooper is a recluse. Ex-military, although he has witnessed his brothers finding their soulmates, Brooks does not believe that he will ever settle down with a woman, that he is destined to live alone until the end of his days. When he discovers tourist Sadie at his family\'s mountain clearing, a sacred spiritual space for the Cooper family, he shoos her away. However, he cannot deny his instinct to make sure she is safe, so he follows her down the trail - and when she comes up against a wolf, he steps in to protect her. An army brat. Sadie recognizes all that has happened to Brooks and feels an instant connection to him. And as he tends to her badly sprained ankle in his cabin, neither can deny that they are feeling for one another things they have never experienced before.If you missed the original series that kicked off Marley Michaels Moose Mountain books, here\'s your chance to catch up.

The biggest surprise though is how Annie reacts to seeing her childhood crush Tate Sheridan. Can Annie help to make their last Christmas at the ranch the most memorable one at all? Can a Christmas miracle save Annie’s job and her family?I loved this novel by RaeAnne Thayne. The story is written so beautifully and the way the ranch is described, just makes you want to join Annie and Tate for Christmas. The characters were wonderful, and I loved the addition of the whole Sheridan family being in the book.

Since I have a vivid imagination and am familiar with the setting in Germany, I had no problems getting 'deeply' involved in the story. I didn't like Jack at the beginning since he seemed a bit rude and not always nice to his friend Sherk, who invited him to come along to visit Germany. Jack did not tell his friend that he had a special reason to accompany him. After I learned of the tragic loss of his wife and daughter through a bombing in Ireland, I understood him.It seemed a little far-fetched to find a lady who sent a letter from Munich to Jack's father about sixty years earlier without an address. But, familiar with German perfectionism, I accepted that it happened. I had to smile at how the author, Meg Lelvis, found a way to lead the reader deftly into the holocaust, the horror that happened in Dachau, one location of the concentration camps where undesirables and Jews were terminated. Some people might not read the book if they knew in advance...Meg is a psychologist and knows how to create characters that make you love or hate them. The feelings I experienced were one aspect I kept on reading - even if at times I would have given up. Despite a couple of anticipated surprises, the ending does not completely satisfy - unless it is book 3 of a series and another book is coming.

Their story at times was so deliciously erotic that I think I bit my lip off while reading some scenes. Every time Kage growled, roared, or whispered dirty things in Natalie’s ear, I felt it deeply (I mean very deeply – my poor BOB got a good workout). IT WAS SO DAMN SEXY!!! These two are just perfect together. The chemistry between them was so explosive, that it just oozed off the pages.

And let’s not forget Sloan – she’s a MF queen in her own right! I can’t wait for her story.Definitely one of the best mafia books I have read! Phenomenal writing and brilliant storytelling.

Everyone needs a Sloan in their life and that girl definitely had no filter whatsoever. She definitely added plenty of fun to this.So when a tattooed hot stranger appears in town moving In next door to Natalie she tries to be friendly only to get shut down fairly swiftly. Kage well he is mysterious and grumpy and initially quite cold but he has his own secrets one's that might be very bad for Nat’s health.Kage has a conflict of interest He’s in town to complete a job one he realises that he can’t go through with and now because of this both of their lives will be placed in danger. he has secrets it’s obvious, but at the same time, he can be refreshingly blunt and almost honest.He tries to tell Natalie as much as he is able to and is transparent about the sort of man he is even going as far as to warn her away and tell her he is no good for her.There’s so much stuff that’s unfair about their situation and if you haven’t guessed this has mafia ties namely the Russian Bratva. I found this to be incredibly hot and Kage whilst lethal could also be very sweet. I liked where this went and it was an enjoyable read it’s slightly instalove which doesn’t always work for me here it did though and after that finish, I will definitely be picking up book two especially after the dramatic finale. It’s Sloane’s story next so I’m looking forward to jumping into that.\n\n""]"

  #1 New York Times BestsellerFrom Liane Moriarty, the #1 New York Times bestselling author of Big Little Lies and Nine Perfect Strangers, comes Apples Never Fall, a novel that looks at marriage, siblings, and how the people we love the most can hurt us the deepest.The Delaney family love one another dearly—it’s just that sometimes they want to murder each other . . .If your mother was missing, would you tell the police? Even if the most obvious suspect was your father?This is the dilemma facing the four grown Delaney siblings.The Delaneys are fixtures in their community. The parents, Stan and Joy, are the envy of all of their friends. They’re killers on the tennis court, and off it their chemistry is palpable. But after fifty years of marriage, they’ve finally sold their famed tennis academy and are ready to start what should be the golden years of their lives. So why are Stan and Joy so miserable?The four Delaney children—Amy, Logan, Troy, and Brooke—were tennis stars in their own right, yet as their father will tell you, none of them had what it took to go all the way. But that’s okay, now that they’re all successful grown-ups and there is the wonderful possibility of grandchildren on the horizon.One night a stranger named Savannah knocks on Stan and Joy’s door, bleeding after a fight with her boyfriend. The Delaneys are more than happy to give her the small kindness she sorely needs. If only that was all she wanted.Later, when Joy goes missing, and Savannah is nowhere to be found, the police question the one person who remains: Stan. But for someone who claims to be innocent, he, like many spouses, seems to have a lot to hide. Two of the Delaney children think their father is innocent, two are not so sure—but as the two sides square off against each other in perhaps their biggest match ever, all of the Delaneys will start to reexamine their shared family history in a very new light.

  I trusted a shifter with my virginity. Until he got me pregnant. Then he rejected me as his mate.I was young and naive when I fell hard for bad boy Grizz, a shifter who was hot enough to melt my good girl heart. Big mistake. Because when good girls are naughty, they end up pregnant.Now I’m back in Forest Heights to care for my aunt with my son Rainer—the son I’ve been raising on my own for nine years because gruff, tough Grizz didn’t believe our baby was possible.But Rainer is living proof that shifters and humans can have babies, and now he’s showing signs of growing up to be just like his daddy. When Grizz realizes Rainer is his, he says he wants to get to know him. And the problem is, I’ll do anything for my son.Except open my heart to Grizz again. I won't be rejected twice.

So much dead-heading!Aldermaston’s having a bad day. A falling hanging-basket has killed the town’s mayor, and a second narrowly missed him.

This isn’t the quiet life he expected as the new Marquess of Mortiforde.It’s the annual Borders in Blossom competition, and Mortiforde is battling with Portley Ridge in the final. But this is no parochial flower competition. The mayor’s mishap looks like murder, and there’s another body in the river. Someone desperately wants Portley Ridge to win for the fifteenth successive year.So when a mysterious group of guerrilla gardeners suddenly carpet bomb Mortiforde with a series of stunning floral delights one night, a chain reaction of floral retaliation ensues.Can Aldermaston survive long enough to uncover who is trying to kill him, and why?

A final, top-secret mission to the Moon. Three astronauts in a tiny module, a quarter of a million miles from home. A quarter of a million miles from help. As Russian and American crews sprint for a secret bounty hidden away on the lunar surface, old rivalries blossom and the political stakes are stretched to breaking point back on Earth.

Love this book!\n']","[""\n\n  This was an exciting, thrill-packed Cold War thriller. Its author, Chris Hadfield, imparts his extraordinary knowledge and experience, bringing atmosphere, authenticity, and credibility to the plot. The gripping, action-packed story is infused with science, technology, politics, espionage, space history, murder, and intrigue with vividly drawn believable characters. Author, Chris Hadfield, is a much-decorated Canadian astronaut, a former fighter pilot, engineer,  spacewalker, served in both the American and Russian space programs, and Commander of the International Space Station. Readers who have not followed the history of the Apollo space program and the space stations may recognize Hatfield may recognize him from the video where he played guitar and sang David Bowie's Space Oddity while floating in 0 Gravity in the ISS. This was featured in news reports at the time and can still be viewed on YouTube. He was active in the space program from 1992 until 2013. I find it difficult to categorize this action-packed novel. This is not so much in the science fiction genre but a historical and suspenseful journey into an alternate past involving a fictional journey of Apollo 18 in 1973. The Apollo program actually ended with Apollo 17, but the story imagines what happens on a subsequent mission to the moon. The writing is filled with an overload of scientific detail and technical descriptions that will appeal more to the space enthusiast than to the casual reader of thrillers. However, the story is so suspenseful, intense, action-packed, and cinematic within a plausible, realistic storyline that it should keep most readers entranced. A leading character is Kaz Zemeckis, a flight controller at Houston. He is assigned to oversee the mission of three astronauts to the moon and ensure their safety from Mission Control.  Kaz missed his goal for going into space when he lost an eye in a training accident. Shortly before blast-off, the astronaut in charge dies in an accident, or was it accidental? The leading backup astronaut replaces him. One astronaut is to stay in the vehicle, circle the moon, and await the two walking on the moon's surface. Due to unfortunate circumstances, this will not be the two originally assigned to the task. At the last minute, the scientific exploration is hastily changed into a military one. The Russians have placed a high-resolution spy satellite in orbit and also a moon rover looking for valuable minerals on the surface.  The astronauts are now ordered to disable both items in order to keep the Russians from advancing in the space race. Kaz is suspicious that one of the astronauts is not what he pretends to be. Surrounding him in Mission Control are many real characters whose names I recognized from the past. Also, at the White House are actual historical people, all seamlessly blended into the story. At the end of the book, I was surprised that most of the characters, except for the fictional Kaz, were real people, and the Russian spy satellite and their moon rover were actually in place at the time. In the high-tension storyline, there are startling encounters, dangers galore from the Russians, and one aboard Apollo 18 may be a murderer. Events do not go as planned, and both the Russians and the Americans are determined to retrieve an exotic, rare mineral from the moon. The Russians are angry that Apollo 18 is trying to disable their space equipment. Back at Mission Control, the sheriff and others are helping Kaz investigate the astronaut's backgrounds and try to keep on top of the changing events in space. What will the outcome be? Will the crew of Apollo 18 succeed in their mission and get home safely? Recommended to those who want adventure, history of early space exploration and moon landings, espionage, and find the technical details enhance the reality of this dramatic story. I was glued to the pages, except for a short break to watch Captain Kirk returning from space in Jeff Bezos's space vehicle.\n\n"", '\n\n  Purchased an early pre-order which was supposed to be signed by the author. Just got my book and it’s a regular version, not signed.\n\n', ""\n\n  When I lived in Russia [Moscow] for three years from 2001 to 2004, I ,  a Canadian woman, was briefy a member of CWIM - Canadian Women in Moscow - which was hosted by Mrs Hadfield. [I went on to host a year of International Women's Club at my downtown flat in 2002-2003]. I also briefly saw Commander Hadfield at a hotel 'do', though I was, of course, not yet aware of his near future importance in international developments in space.Because of my admittedly small increased awareness of his activities, I looked forward to buying a copy of Commander Hadfield's novel, 'The Apollo Murders'. I tried to read through the book, but had to stop halfway, enmired in technical detail but not finding much by the way of character and plot development. I cannot recommend the novel.\n\n"", '\n\n  This book was good interweaving of fact and fiction, by an author who actually lived a number of the adventures described.  Only drawback I thought was the minimal depth of character of the sole female in this story (a cosmonaut).  I hope Chris Hadfield considers writing more fiction!\n\n', '\n\n  I have  seen Chris Hadfield on TV many times and have been  impressed by his remarkable skill set. I did wonder however how he would do as a writer of fiction. I was very much impressed with ""The Apollo Murders"" and his attention to detail in describing the workings of a space craft and the ins and outs of day to day life working for NASA. The book unwinds at a very nice pace and as we get to know the main characters we feel part of the myriad of decisions being made on the Apollo  spacecraft and back at Houston. I also loved the Russian connection within the plot and even the fact that not everything works out for the Americans. If I had one criticism it would be to include a few more dangerous adventures/episodes throughout the book even if it meant including less detail about space. I felt I was turning the pages at times waiting for the ""shoe to drop"" only to be teased along until we got to the point the craft was ready to leave the moon and the gun shot was fired. Having said all this I would recommend the book to anyone and look forward to his next effort.\n\n', ""\n\n  Sorry, I didn't make it to the end before beginning another book. It got a bit too technical for me but those into flight etc will love it. I intend to pick it up again because it fascinated me. Have never before realized the complicated machinery and electronics that are involved for one in flight. The author's writing is perfectly executed but writing a mystery involves a rather more taut and direct line from  start to  finish. Doing a mystery novel is not rocket science.\n\n"", '\n\n  This is a real page turner that will appeal to fans of political thrillers and space. Chris Hadfield takes the reader back to the moon landings and the Cold War. Through the characters the reader experience what it’s like to be an astronaut. A great book! I hope there are more novels on the way.\n\n', '\n\n  So well written I hated to put it down. I loved that he shared his fantastic knowledge with us in an interesting way. I will absolutely be buying his other books too. Hopefully he will be as prolific as Steven King.\n\n']"

It is a further indictment of the warehousing of psychiatric patients and the mistreatment that creates psychosis in previously healthy individuals.But the book is so much more...It is a book of healing and hope for the traumatized. Through Nora's story we witness the grace of forgiveness for the unforgivable and a life beyond mistreatment.I know some reviewers criticize the author's insertion of her own story, but I think it is very relevant because Nora's courage and journey helped the author with her own healing from trauma.

  Queen of Anarchy is the heart-pounding second installment in the Dirty Broken Savages series.Note: The blurb below contains spoilers for the first book, so I'd highly recommend not reading it until you've finished reading book one, Kings of Chaos. You've been warned!***I was a good girl once. But bad b*tches get shit done.My list is finished. Every name has been crossed off. I should be sipping cocktails on a beach somewhere, breathing easy for the first time in years.But I’m not.Because that asshole Ivan St. James refused to stay at the bottom of the river where Knox put him.Because someone dragged his body up from the depths and laid it out as a very public, very gruesome warning.Because I swear it was Hannah’s eyes I saw behind that mask.Nothing makes sense anymore, and if I thought I might find some peace in knowing that the men who hurt us are dead, I was wrong.The game isn’t over yet. The original deal I struck with the Kings of Chaos is null and void, and despite my plan to walk away from them when this was all done, there’s no way I can do that now.Our fates are entwined, at least until we sort out this mess.Honestly, I don’t know how to feel about that. Because as much as I refuse to let my walls down for anyone, I’m starting to think these four brutal, dangerous men…Might be the only ones I can trust.Queen of Anarchy is a full length mafia/gang new adult romance featuring a slightly psycho heroine and four even more psychotic men.

While each story was set in different time periods and unique to the author’s style they all flowed together wonderfully.Legacy of Love by Kristi Ann HunterThis story hooked me right from the beginning with the matchmaking grandmother. I had to laugh at her antics and the way that Randall and Sarah tried to avoid them. I quickly came to care for each character.Gift of the Heart by Karen WitemeyerThis was such a sweet story. Ruth is determined to provide for her daughter and will give whatever needed to do this. Bo agrees to the plan she has presented but wants to stay in the background. I absolutely loved the way that Ruth befriends Bo and helps him learn to become more comfortable around others. The interactions between Bo and Ruth’s daughter, Naomi, were delightful.A Shot at Love by Sarah Loudin ThomasFleeta was a girl with a set plan in place and that plan does not include allowing a guy into her life. However when Hank and Fleeta meet there is instant attraction, neither can stop thinking about the other. Fleeta fights the attraction and tries to move ahead with her plans, but when things take a turn for the worse Hank comes to her rescue and her opinion of allowing him in her life changes. I loved how supportive Fleeta’s family was of her dreams.Because of You by Becky WadeThis was my favourite story. I loved that this story tied in with Becky Wade’s series, the Bradford sisters. Maddie works with Britt and has feelings for Leo but feels like she can let them known. When these two are teamed up together for a Christmas project they end up spending quite a bit of time together and Leo begins to see Maddie differently. Their story is story of healing and moving forward and contained so much depth I was not expecting in a novella. I loved these two and it was easy to root for them to come together.

Kinch Na Shannack owes the Takers Guild a small fortune for his education as a thief, which includes (but is not limited to) lock-picking, knife-fighting, wall-scaling, fall-breaking, lie-weaving, trap-making, plus a few small magics. His debt has driven him to lie in wait by the old forest road, planning to rob the next traveler that crosses his path.But today, Kinch Na Shannack has picked the wrong mark.Galva is a knight, a survivor of the brutal goblin wars, and handmaiden of the goddess of death. She is searching for her queen, missing since a distant northern city fell to giants.Unsuccessful in his robbery and lucky to escape with his life, Kinch now finds his fate entangled with Galva's. Common enemies and uncommon dangers force thief and knight on an epic journey where goblins hunger for human flesh, krakens hunt in dark waters, and honor is a luxury few can afford.“The Blacktongue Thief is fast and fun and filled with crazy magic.

You do have to work a little to absorb it in parts. There is a lot of made up slang and cultural stuff and references to past history in the countries of the story that you somewhat have to figure out as you go, but in a way that pulled me into it more.The main character has a great world weary cynicism and is always ready with a joke. The author convincingly makes him a character to empathize with. I\'ve seen this comparison before, but as far as thief characters go Kinch is more nuanced and compelling than Locke from the ""Lies of Locke Lamora"" series in my opinion.I\'m left looking forward to the sequel.

  ADVISORY FROM THE AUTHOR:  This novel contains sexual situations and adult content.  It has very little history.  If you like your romance novels to be light on sex scenes and heavy on the history, this isn't the book for you.  It is the sixth and final book in the Kellington series, but it's a stand-alone novel.  To catch you up....the Duke of Lynwood and his four siblings all found love.  Now, it's their friend's turn.When Bow Street Inspector Joseph Stapleton is sent to Oxfordshire to help the daughter of an earl, little does he know how the mission will affect him personally. Lady Evelyn Williams must marry within weeks, but she has never met a gentleman of the ton whom she would even consider as a potential husband.  Then she encounters the brave, handsome man from London.NEVER TURN AWAY is the story of a love that defies society's expectations.  It also introduces Colin Emerson, Lord Ridgeway, whose story is told in ALWAYS COME HOME.

And I have to say, the snippet at the end that Ms. Driscoll actually cut from the book - about how Joseph almost got killed - I wish she had kept that in.  As it is, it just seems a little to tidy that Evelyn was drugged and moved, yet once Joseph and the Kellington's arrive at the house, Ridgeway says he knows where Robert hangs out and when Evelyn is escaping and opens the door, there is Joseph.

  “A stunningly detailed history . . . from sexy socialite double agents to ‘kill switches’ implanted offshore in the computer chips for our electric grid” (R. James Woolsey, former director of Central Intelligence).   For decades, while America obsessed over Soviet spies, China quietly penetrated the highest levels of government. Now, for the first time, based on numerous interviews with key insiders at the FBI and CIA as well as with Chinese agents and people close to them, David Wise tells the full story of China’s many victories and defeats in its American spy wars.   Two key cases interweave throughout: Katrina Leung, code-named Parlor Maid, worked for the FBI for years even after she became a secret double agent for China, aided by love affairs with both of her FBI handlers. Here, too, is the inside story of the case, code-named Tiger Trap, of a key Chinese-American scientist suspected of stealing nuclear weapons secrets.   These two cases led to many others, involving famous names from Wen Ho Lee to Richard Nixon, stunning national security leaks, sophisticated cyberspying, and a West Coast spy ring whose members were sentenced in 2010. As concerns swirl about US-China relations and the challenges faced by our intelligence community, Tiger Trap provides an important overview from “America’s premier writer on espionage” (The Washington Post Book World).   “Wise’s conclusion is sobering—China’s spying on America is ongoing, current, and shows no signs of diminishing—and his book is a fascinating history of Chinese espionage.” —Publishers Weekly   “A fact-filled inside account, with sources named and no one spared.” —Seymour M.

If you enjoyed the elegant A Gentleman in Moscow or the engaging Where the Crawdads Sing, or the heart-racing American Dirt, this is going to fall so flat for you. Abby Jimenez is quoted on the back cover of the book saying “probably one of my favourite books of all time.” Yikes. Makes me wonder what else she reads.Here are my issues:1) The story is uninspired - it’s not creative and misses out on the premise of yearly vacations. There’s so much more that could have been built into those flashbacks, especially since the book is 361 pages long. It was actually quite a boring read.2) There is not really any character development. There’s a lot of surface analyzing, but considering the span of over a decade, the characters feel static. And they’re not particularly likeable or memorable either.3) While the writing flows easily, it’s not very elegant. There is a lot of dialogue, and you can tell the author spent a lot of time preparing witty exchanges between her characters. And she does pull it off. But there’s something inorganic and juvenile about it.4) All elements considered, the book feels written for a teen audience and not adults. I cringed several times.In summary, this book is just not inspired, doesn’t have an engaging storyline, and didn’t make me feel anything for either of the main characters.

  FBI Agent Atlee Pine’s harrowing search for her long-lost sister Mercy reaches a boiling point in this breakneck thriller from #1 New York Times bestselling author David Baldacci.   For her entire life, FBI agent Atlee Pine has been searching for her twin sister, Mercy, who was abducted at the age of six and never seen again. Mercy’s disappearance left behind a damaged family that later shattered beyond repair when Atlee’s parents inexplicably abandoned her. Now, after a perilous investigation that nearly proved fatal, Atlee has finally discovered not only the reason behind her parents’ abandonment and Mercy’s kidnapping, but also the most promising breakthrough yet: proof that Mercy survived her abduction and then escaped her captors many years ago.  Though Atlee is tantalizingly close to her family at last, the final leg of her long road to Mercy will be the most treacherous yet. Mercy left at least one dead body behind before fleeing her captors years before. Atlee has no idea if her sister is still alive, and if so, how she has been surviving all this time. When the truth is finally revealed, Atlee Pine will face the greatest danger yet, and it may well cost her everything.

  That awkward moment when an ER doctor has to inform you that you’re pregnant…with his baby. Three things Lynsey Jones knows about the hot doctor: he’s grouchy, an arrogant jerk, and strangely obsessed with pie. Three things Dr. Josh Richardson knows: he doesn’t talk about his past, he doesn’t do relationships, and the crazy girl in the hospital cafeteria who ate a fistful of French silk pie…is annoyingly irresistible. After a chance meetup at a bar and a heated cab ride together, things come to a head and now instead of hating each other, they’re horizontal in a bed. Three months later, the weird cafeteria stalker who crept out of Josh's house like a thief in the night, winds up as his patient in the ER after her Tinder date from hell. The doctor is prepared to keep it cool and professional. That is until her bloodwork reveals that she’s pregnant. What really throws him for a loop…is that the surprise baby…is his.

I don’t care what she writes, I always grab it sight unseen knowing that I will love it no matter what.  Amy’s ability to introduce humour with her witty remarks always gives me gut busters.  To many times, I’m came close to falling off my treadmill laughing so hard. Reading her books always give me a feeling of joy and make a bad day so much better. This romantic comedy, is just terrific and I loved reading it.  The story is about Lindsey and Joshua aka Dr. Dick - yes, the title suits - he is so broken you can’t help but root for him.  Lyndsey is a sweet, loveable, klutz who ends up being Dr. Dick’s assistant, and the best assistant he’s ever had.  Both characters have such depth you soon forget you are reading a story and become part of it and when you can lose yourself in a story, they are the very best.  This is a book a highly recommend and guarantee you will love.

Josh is dedicated to his job as a doctor and a real jerk at times, hence the nickname ""Dr. Dick"", lol! Lynsey is his complete opposite, but there\'s just this undeniable chemistry between them they need to explore. It was so funny to watch their antics. As it\'s the norm with Amy Daws, this story is packed with hilarious dialogues, sexy encounters and also touching moments too! One Moment Please was a really enjoyable read that\'s for sure!\n\n', ""\n\n  One Moment Please is the third installment in the Wait With Me standalone series. This is the first novel I have read from this author and series and I definitely plan on diving into more.Lynsey and Josh are two strangers who start their relationship with the definition of enemies. They are constantly at each other's throats until Josh insists they share an Uber. One fight leads to some heated tension as they inevitably clash. After Lynsey's quick get away the pair don't cross paths until three months later when Josh the ER doctor has to break the news to Lynsey that she's pregnant…….With his kid. Josh is forced to relive his haunting past as Lynsey struggles to accept her current reality.The synopsis was the first thing that drew me into this book and boy did it not disappoint. From the very beginning of the novel, I was enthralled with the characters. The first couple of chapters makes me laugh harder than I have while reading a book in a very long time. I absolutely loved this story and the slow burn of their relationship had me on edge the entire time. This is by far the best book I have read in months.If you want a laugh-out-loud read with a hot doctor and the perfect amount of smut check out One Moment Please. *Note, Trigger warning. If you are sensitive to child loss please be advised*Star Rating:⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐Spice Rating:🔥🔥🔥🔥\n\n"", '\n\n  I enjoyed the “will they/won’t they.” Lots of back and forth.

Glad you do not need to read all 4 in order.\n\n', '\n\n  Enjoyable story!  Enjoyed seeing the other characters from previous books as well!  Hoping to see a book about Dean and the bakery owner!\n\n', '\n\n  Amy Daws is an excellent writer, but I just couldn’t get into this one the same way as I could her Harris Brother series, which I LOVED.This book contains the heart, humour, and heat that readers have come to expect from Amy Daws. All of that was as on point as possible. For me, though, there was simply too much angst in this book. “Dr. Dick” really did come across as a dick sometimes. I also often didn’t like the way Lynsey and Josh treated each other. If someone I were involved with treated me the way they periodically treated each other, I would have been very unimpressed.In the end, I think it comes down to preference. As I said, the book is very well written and likely to appeal to many. I just don’t love tropes that involve people who behave badly (even if it’s due to past trauma) or ones in which people are super attracted to each other, while seeming to actively dislike each other. I don’t go for anything in the “hate sex” sphere. I just can’t get my head around attraction that doesn’t involve at least some element of like and/or respect for the other person.Despite my own lack of love for this book, hats off to Amy Daws for exploring something new. We never know how something will go until we try it. :-)\n\n']"

Until last month, she was a teacher at Horton College – the same high school she went to ten years ago along with her best friend, Fiona. But Fiona died in a tragic accident on their graduation night, and since then nothing’s been the same. Now Sadie’s back in her home town, living with Fiona’s mother, the woman who has watched over Sadie since she was a little girl, and the one person Sadie would do anything to protect. But when Sadie hears that star student Devon Hundley has gone missing from Horton College, everything changes. Because Devon is the daughter of Philip Hundley - a wealthy school donor, local doctor, and a man Sadie knows all too well. And Sadie can't help remembering the last time she saw Devon - and heard her whisper something Sadie's been trying ever since to forget...A 2020 top new release, The Silent Daughter is domestic suspense at its best: a twisty page-turner about family secrets and dangerous lies for fans of Diane Chamberlain, Liane Moriarty, and Adele Parks.

Her co-star is a young teacher who has ties to the girl and her family and secrets alluded to. The storytelling is fairly restrained, I wasn't filled with tension and TBH I wasn't holding my breath waiting to find what happened to the missing girl.

  NEW YORK TIMES BESTSELLER • “This is one of those books that will go down as the seminal work—the determinative work—in this field. . . . Terrifying.”—Rachel MaddowThe first definitive account of the rise and fall of the Secret Service, from the Kennedy assassination to the alarming mismanagement of the Obama and Trump years, right up to the insurrection at the Capitol on January 6—by the Pulitzer Prize winner and #1 New York Times bestselling co-author of A Very Stable Genius and I Alone Can Fix It NAMED ONE OF THE BEST BOOKS OF THE YEAR BY THE WASHINGTON POSTCarol Leonnig has been reporting on the Secret Service for The Washington Post for most of the last decade, bringing to light the secrets, scandals, and shortcomings that plague the agency today—from a toxic work culture to dangerously outdated equipment to the deep resentment within the ranks at key agency leaders, who put protecting the agency’s once-hallowed image before fixing its flaws. But the Secret Service wasn’t always so troubled.The Secret Service was born in 1865, in the wake of the assassination of Abraham Lincoln, but its story begins in earnest in 1963, with the death of John F. Kennedy. Shocked into reform by its failure to protect the president on that fateful day in Dallas, this once-sleepy agency was radically transformed into an elite, highly trained unit that would redeem itself several times, most famously in 1981 by thwarting an assassination attempt against Ronald Reagan. But this reputation for courage and excellence would not last forever. By Barack Obama’s presidency, the once-proud Secret Service was running on fumes and beset by mistakes and alarming lapses in judgment: break-ins at the White House, an armed gunman firing into the windows of the residence while confused agents stood by, and a massive prostitution scandal among agents in Cartagena, to name just a few. With Donald Trump’s arrival, a series of promised reforms were cast aside, as a president disdainful of public service instead abused the Secret Service to rack up political and personal gains.To explore these problems in the ranks, Leonnig interviewed dozens of current and former agents, government officials, and whistleblowers who put their jobs on the line to speak out about a hobbled agency that’s in desperate need of reform. “I will be forever grateful to them for risking their careers,” she writes, “not because they wanted to share tantalizing gossip about presidents and their families, but because they know that the Service is broken and needs fixing. By telling their story, they hope to revive the Service they love.”   Read more  ","['4.0 out of 5 stars', '5.0 out of 5 stars', '5.0 out of 5 stars', '3.0 out of 5 stars', '5.0 out of 5 stars', '5.0 out of 5 stars', '5.0 out of 5 stars', '5.0 out of 5 stars']","['\nA frightening expose\n', '\nEye Opening Book !!\n', '\nZero Fail is brilliant\n', '\nFor half the book it was interesting - then it got boring!\n', '\nGreat Read\n', '\nVery detailed.\n', '\nA scary and, in-debth review of a bro dominated, old guard service of (mostly) privileged white men who protect their own, whatever the circumstances.\n', '\nimportant book\n']","['\n\n  This is a great book that reviews in detail the Secret service failures, the politics and the old boys club attitude that has severly hampered its role and  function.The details on the Kennedy Assassination is frightening as is the failures during the Obama years and the deleterious affects of the tRUMP administration.\n\n', '\n\n  Wow - never realized the inner battles within the Secret Service - Great eye opening read - Very well timeline presentation.

  Sarah J. Maas's sexy, richly imagined series continues with the journey of Feyre's fiery sister, Nesta. Nesta Archeron has always been prickly-proud, swift to anger, and slow to forgive. And ever since being forced into the Cauldron and becoming High Fae against her will, she's struggled to find a place for herself within the strange, deadly world she inhabits. Worse, she can't seem to move past the horrors of the war with Hybern and all she lost in it.The one person who ignites her temper more than any other is Cassian, the battle-scarred warrior whose position in Rhysand and Feyre's Night Court keeps him constantly in Nesta's orbit. But her temper isn't the only thing Cassian ignites. The fire between them is undeniable, and only burns hotter as they are forced into close quarters with each other. Meanwhile, the treacherous human queens who returned to the Continent during the last war have forged a dangerous new alliance, threatening the fragile peace that has settled over the realms. And the key to halting them might very well rely on Cassian and Nesta facing their haunting pasts.Against the sweeping backdrop of a world seared by war and plagued with uncertainty, Nesta and Cassian battle monsters from within and without as they search for acceptance-and healing-in each other's arms.

I went into this book with an open mind. I thought Sarah j Mass did a fantastic job writing Nesta. She isn’t perfect. She does and says things that make you want to slap her but I liked that, it made her real. She’s not some cut and paste hero that saves the world. She is flawed.  Her character growth in this book was exactly what I had hoped for. Not to mention her and Cassian were perfect for each other and the steamy senes were fantastic. I thought this book was more character driven as opposed to plot driven like the others and I enjoyed that. All in all, I loved it and can’t wait for the next book.\n\n', '\n\n  Every time Sarah writes a book it’s full of laughter, tears and whoops for the characters as they tell their story. She truly paints a world you can sink into for days. A lot of people hated Nesta since she acted like a petulant child in the other books but this one... this one was needed not just for us readers but for her. To show you can be worthy as long as you work on yourself a little every day. By setting small goals and achieving them and doing it again and again until you dig yourself out of the deep mental hole. Amazing book can’t wait for the next.\n\n', ""\n\n  I have read the whole series in a few weeks and I think it might be one of my fav series. I think it's the way Sarah has built this world, I just get lost in it and love reading about these characters.It was enjoyable to read from Nesta's & Cassian's perspective, I could really relate and imagine the journey that Nesta went on. Her descriptions of drowning in her fears, then facing them and then trying to embrace and overcome them was something I could really relate to.It was cool to hear more about the history, magic and powers this world has. I did think that sometimes it was so character building that the drama side of the plot for a bit of a back seat, and for some readers they might not like that. However I think it all wove in to each part of the story really well in the end. It was cool to read about such a strong friendship with Nesta and her girlfriends.The romance between Cassian and Nesta is so steamy!! But done very tastefully. I also think it really adds to their story so I think it was a good addition.Not going to lie that I think there is still a lot of story to tell about Feyre & Rhys and it was a little sad to have them side lined. I don't think Rhys is a character that suits the side line. I think there is a lot of story to tell about all the other characters and I can't wait for the next book! Might go back and reread them all now!\n\n"", '\n\n  I didn’t care much for the heroine of this story when she’d appeared in previous instalments in the series, but if ever there was a redemption arc to be had, this was certainly it. Nesta was damaged and real, very relatable, in the end. I loved seeing her growth and the developing relationships between her and all the other characters. The plot was intricate and full of action in parts.There were a couple drawbacks, such as the wild amount of consummating the two MCs did. Seriously, it seemed to take up a good quarter of the book. It didn’t bother me, I am not squeamish in the least, but at a certain point, it almost seemed to stall the storyline, a bit too much like filler. Overall though, anything I had issue with in the book didn’t detract from my overall enjoyment. A good book, and I look forward to reading more, should it ever come, about any of these characters.\n\n', '\n\n  Sarah J Maas has once again ruined me with one of her books. I was nervous going into this book because of the mixed reviews about it, but my curiosity outweighed my trepidation. First of all… I was expecting way more spice in this book considering so many reviews said it was straight p0rn 😂 not that I didn’t appreciate the smutty scenes, but I’ve definitely read dirtier books. I always felt a connection with Nesta in the original series, and so I was glad to be able to read more of her story. The fierce female friendships she develops in this story are heartwarming and just what she needs to begin healing from the trauma she experienced, and what her friends need as well. From the time she was a small child, she was honed to be a weapon. While I do not agree with her behaviour, I can certainly understand it. Her dynamic with Cassian was frustrating at times, but I loved the electric chemistry between them and how much of a support system Cassian provided for Nesta while she was healing… being an advocate when he needed to but also stepping back and letting her do her own thing. It’s a balance many of us struggle with and I loved how caring and considerate he was! Her story of loss and regret is one that I think most of us relate to in one way or another and was beautifully written. I would also just like to thank Sarah for finally answering the question of what Cassian threw into the Sidra! I GREATLY appreciated Nesta being a lover of smutty romance books and that being the thing that bonds her to Gwyn and Emerie. Overall I loved this book and have a deep appreciation for Nesta’s character development. It’s not a 5-star for me solely because of the pregnancy trope… I could have done without that whole plot line.\n\n', '\n\n  I honestly started this series a couple weeks ago and devoured these books. I don’t know what expectations I had of Nesta but I’m so happy she got her time to shine. Her character grew on me after acomf. Now getting to see her character development was a real treat. I was on the edge of my seat with this story. That being said...Spoilers aheadCassian and Nesta 😳😳😳 wow those scenes were something haha I enjoyed very much. I love how their relationship developed. It was so nice to see them come together. I just love them. 💖💖💖Now this book was quite emotional for me. Nesta’s inner thoughts really resonated with me. I cried during her breakdown because of how real it felt. I think that might be my favourite chapter. It just struck home. It was written so well I had to put the book down and cry.And with that I think this might be my favourite book of the series. I look forward to seeing what else this story has to offer.🌟\n\n']"

But over the course of one night, each of their lives will be changed forever in this propulsive novel from the New York Times bestselling author of Daisy Jones & The Six.Malibu is buzzing with anticipation for Nina Riva's annual party. Everyone wants to be in the company of the famous Rivas: Nina, the surfer and model; her brothers, Jay and Hud, one a championship surfer, the other his renowned photographer; and Kit, the adored baby of the family. As if that picture-perfect family isn't enough, their father is Mick Riva, the legendary singer. By morning, the Riva mansion will have burned to the ground. And no one will know how the fire started. But before that first spark in the early hours before dawn, the alcohol will flow, the music will play and the loves and secret yearnings that shaped this family across generations will all come bubbling to the surface to make for a night no one will ever forget. This is a story about family: about what you choose to keep from the people who made you, and what you must leave behind.

Probably too high. The reviewer that called it a slow-moving car crash was pretty accurate. You'll fall hard for the Rivas, and root for them at every turn. And you'll feel sickly anxious as the dread builds in the final act, wondering which domino will be the one that causes it all to come toppling down. Overall though, I'm not sure I can honestly say this is the kind of book I'd be quick to recommend to friends. It's a slow burn with not a lot of plot (and a whole lot of characters). I'd give it a 3.5 out of 5. It goes down as easy as June Riva's Seagrams, but has roughly the same memorability.\n\n"", ""\n\n  Most of the characters were given little or no depth - you could barely remember who they were much less care about them. The one character, Nina, who is explored in more detail is totally inconsistent - she is strong enough to raise three siblings on her own but then too weak to stand up for herself in several less challenging circumstances. Lots of quick plot twists without enough of a story behind them to really be interesting. Like watching a low budget soap opera. I don't' think its a good beach read because it just isn't engaging enough.\n\n"", '\n\n  I could not have loved this book any more. The Rivas became real people to me. People I cared about. People I wanted to know better. The sense of family he knew. Their love for each other. Just a beautiful book that I will read many times in the future.\n\n', ""\n\n  I'll start off by saying I loved Daisy Jones and the six so I was looking forward to reading this. Held out a bit for things to pick up, and honestly this is hands down one of the most boring books I've ever read.  I cant even believe I finished it. Super disappointed since I do like the author.\n\n"", '\n\n  Pros: fun, easy read. Interesting characters and I like the way the story was told.Cons: the writing/dialogue is very cringy at times.

A time of disease, fear and paranoia as we all head into the dark tunnel of a dystopian future where nothing can ever be assumed or taken for granted anymore.\n\n', '\n\n  British author Panayotis Cacoyannis was born and grew up in Cyprus, studied Law at Oxford, and then moved to London and qualified to practice at the Bar. The Legal landscape was not to his liking so he changed careers and entered Art School. Winning a Degree in Fine Art, and an MA in Painting from the Royal College of Art, he spent his next years painting and sculpting. Another career step directed him to courses in Creative Writing. So in his debut novel THE DEAD OF AUGUST he tossed in all prior experience and out came a novel that is a delight to read on many levels. Cacoyannis seems to have a penchant for satire and parody and has absorbed that inherently British sense of comedy touched with Cyprian flavors that makes his writing not only entertaining but lightens our own lives a bit - seeing how absurdity just may be the best medicine for surviving at the moment! Much the same can be said about his subsequent novels – BOWL OF FRUIT (1907), POLK, HARPER & WHO, FINGER OF AN ANGEL, THE MADNESS OF GRIEF, and now THE COLDNESS OF OBJECTS - only now the increasing sophistication of how Panayotis dissects ‘one man’s lonely rebellion and journey to courage, after early loss and a life of withdrawal and isolation’ (from the author’s words) makes his work even more impressive.Panayotis sculpts figures – his characters – with such polish that in but a few words we are able to visualize and appreciate them. Example, as we meet Anthony Rubens: ‘In the exquisite comfort of his favourite armchair – an original, and signed, 1960s Amoeba – Mr Rubens contemplated his surroundings with pleasure. He was a man of impeccable taste, if he sad so himself: a real connoisseur. One leg crossed over the other, rather sprawled in the vastness of this singular piece of design, he basked in the warm, affectionate light of the fiberglass lamp that loomed overhead, suspended from the ceiling by invisible threads. Mr Rubens held his cup in mid-air in a satisfied reverie as if to savour the moment for longer, though precisely what moment he savoured, and why, Mr Rubens would have found it hard to describe…’ And very subtly we discover Mr Rubens is a gay man  simply by the author’s exceptional use of descriptive language.The story, so very successful on many levels, is condensed as follows: ‘London 2030. When a postman knocks on his door, the news he delivers will cause 70-year-old Anthony Pablo Rubens to reflect on all the sadnesses and joys of the past, while he begins to prepare for the surprises of the future. The past still revolves around the moment in the summer of 1984 when young Anthony first realized he had fallen in love. The present is a Kafkaesque nightmare worse than Orwell\'s 1984, ""a hideous world where people don\'t need to be watched by Big Brother."" It\'s a world that Anthony has mostly shut his eyes to, but which suddenly he is forced to confront. And the future now encompasses the mystery, and excitement, and dread of a day as an exhibit at the National People\'s Museum.’With this particularly fine novel Panayotis Cacoyannis confirms his accelerating status as a major author. He simply just gets better with each book. Highly recommended. Grady Harp, March 21\n\n']"

I ate my vegetables, volunteered at the local autism centre and sat in the front pew of church every Sunday.Then, I got cancer.What the hell kind of reward was that for a boring life well lived?I was a seventeen-year-old paradigm of virtue and I was tired of it. So, when I finally ran into the man I'd been writing to since he saved my life as a little girl and he offered to show me the dark side of life before I left it for good, I said yes. Only, I didn't know that Zeus Garro was the President of The Fallen MC and when you made a deal with a man who is worse than the devil, there was no going back...This is Zeus Garro's story from Lessons In Corruption.

This book. This BOOK! I can’t even articulate how good it was. (But I’m gonna try!) This book has it all. Forbidden romance? Yup. Incredibly sweet scenes? Yup. Steamy stuff? Double yup. Super intense suspenseful parts? Yup. A plot that twists and turns in all the right directions, taking the overall story arch from the first book and building on it and making this book unputdownable? Oh, YUP.Unlike the first in the series, <i>Welcome to the Dark Side</i> gives us point of view chapters from both the hero’s and the heroines’ points of view. This is a must for MC romances (though with the first book the limited perspective worked), since it’s guaranteed that there is a lot going on with the MC that the heroine just isn’t privy to. I absolutely LOVED both the hero and the heroine. Darling deals with tough issues like cancer and domestic abuse in a sensitive way, but the book still doesn’t lose that hopeful feeling.This is one of those books that makes me wish that I didn’t hand out five stars all willy nilly. I’ll be adding this to my reread list.This book gets 5+++ stars. If you like dark romance, what are you waiting for?

Loved Zeus. I loved his filthy mouth, how fierce he is and his huge heart.I liked Zeus and Lou together. Great book couple.  Looking forward to the next one.\n\n', '\n\n  This book was a trip!

This book was darker and grittier than King and his Queen in Lessons in Corruption. While King to me was light..Zeus was dark and both stories were equally fantastic but in very different ways.

Can not wait for Harleigh’s story!\n\n', '\n\n  I had my misgivings when I started reading this book because of the significant age difference between Zeus and Lou, but learning how they loved each other for so long and what each meant and represented to the other, solidified my appreciation.

  Pakersfield, Georgia, 1958: Thirteen-year-old Tangy Mae Quinn is the sixth of ten fatherless siblings. She is the darkest-skinned among them and therefore the ugliest in her mother, Rozelle’s, estimation, but she’s also the brightest. Rozelle—beautiful, charismatic, and light-skinned—exercises a violent hold over her children. Fearing abandonment, she pulls them from school at the age of twelve and sends them to earn their keep for the household, whether in domestic service, in the fields, or at “the farmhouse” on the edge of town, where Rozelle beds local men for money.   But Tangy Mae has been selected to be part of the first integrated class at a nearby white high school. She has a chance to change her life, but can she break from Rozelle’s grasp without ruinous—even fatal—consequences?

By Delores Phillips, 387pp (2004)The Darkest Child is the story of Tangy Mae Quinn, one of ten children bornto a brutal mother, Rozelle Quinn.  Tangy struggles to become educated inspite of a racist Georgia town and a mother who takes joy in killing herdreams and self esteem.The story captures you right away.  You feel for Rozelle's children, who inspite of everything love their mother and crave her acceptance. While youget to know a little about each sibling, Tangy is the narrator of the bookand the story evolves around her.  Tangy is a wonderful heroine, smart,sensitive, talented and pretty and your heart breaks for the horrors sheendures at the hands of her mother.I loved the first two thirds of the book, and I could not put it down.However, when Tangy's mother forces her into prostitution, I felt sick andliterally could not sleep.  The description was so vivid and so disturbingthat I had a hard time reading and processing it.  This is not a knock onthe author or the book, but more like a word of caution to potentialreaders that this book is pretty intense.One criticism I did have of the book is that it ended too abruptly.  Iwanted to know what happened to Tangy and her siblings.  I wanted to knowthat they were going to be alright. Another problem I had with the book wasthat I wanted to know more about what made Rozelle tick.  She was obviouslymentally ill, but I wanted to know what happened to her to make her such amonster.  She had no redeeming qualities and was pretty much onedimensional: pure evil.  The book eluded to the fact that she was theproduct of rape, and born with the devil in her.  I personally do notbelieve people are born evil and I wanted to know more about herbackground.  I felt the story called out for a more complete explanation.The final problem I had with the book is that Rozelle was a bi-racial womanand I felt her character with all her unexplained craziness perpetuated themyth of the tortured mulatto.  Unfortunately, this is not the firstcontemporary fiction book that I have read that has embodied this theme ora variation on this theme.  There has been a lot of pain associated withcolor within our community, and what we need from our writers arethoughtful discussions, and more complete characters, not knee jerkstereotypes.All criticisms aside, I still thought the book was wonderful; verydetailed, very moving and an outstanding first effort by a very talentedauthor.4 starsreviewed bymisrichMahoganyHudson&Albany\n\n"", '\n\n  The Darkest Child is a powerful debut from Delores Phillips; one so strong, I think she should earn a nomination for ""rookie author of the year,"" if such a category in literature exists.  It is a harrowing saga set in the late 1950\'s in rural Georgia and narrated by a teenaged Tangy Mae Quinn.  Tangy is child number seven from Rozelle (Rosie) Quinn, a beautiful woman who has slept with most of the men in the town resulting in marriage to no one and ten fatherless children by as many men.  Rosie exhibits selfish, erratic behavior leading the reader to believe she is a paranoid schizophrenic, although she is never diagnosed as such in the novel.  Rosie rules the household with an iron fist (and an occasional iron poker) and is mean-spirited and merciless.  Partially because of her mental condition, Rosie brainwashes the children with biblical references to ""Honor Thy Mother"" which burdens them with an obligation to forfeit all earnings to Rosie and never abandon her.Although Tangy is the lead storyteller, there are numerous characters with much drama of their own and a subplot surrounding the Civil Rights struggle and school integration.  Phillips also adds the classic theme of ""colorism"", in which the options of dark-skinned women in a color-conscious, male-dominated society are limited; however in this novel, Tangy tries to overcome it via education.  There are tantalizing family secrets and vivid descriptions of child abuse which elicits reader empathy for the characters.  I felt the characters\' pain as they struggled with suppressed anger/frustrations from the domestic situation with a manipulative, mad mother as well as the social situation regarding second-class citizenry in the segregated South.This is a really good book if you like to read about African American familes and women\'s issues and struggles.  However, I thought it could have been a great book if the cause of Rosie\'s dementia was revealed and had more closure on the outcome of key characters.  Perhaps a sequel is forthcoming....if so, I would love to read it.PhyllisAPOOO BookClub, The Nubian Circle Book Club\n\n']"

  A dark, compulsively readable psychological suspense debut, the first in a new series featuring the brilliant, fearless, chaotic, and deeply flawed Nora Watts—a character as heartbreakingly troubled, emotionally complex, and irresistibly compelling as Stieg Larsson’s Lisbeth Salander and Jo Nesbø’s Harry Hole.It begins with a phone call that Nora Watts has dreaded for fifteen years—since the day she gave her newborn daughter up for adoption. Bonnie has vanished. The police consider her a chronic runaway and aren’t looking, leaving her desperate adoptive parents to reach out to her birth mother as a last hope.A biracial product of the foster system, transient, homeless, scarred by a past filled with pain and violence, Nora knows intimately what happens to vulnerable girls on the streets. Caring despite herself, she sets out to find Bonnie with her only companion, her mutt Whisper, knowing she risks reopening wounds that have never really healed—and plunging into the darkness with little to protect her but her instincts and a freakish ability to detect truth from lies.The search uncovers a puzzling conspiracy that leads Nora on a harrowing journey of deception and violence, from the gloomy rain-soaked streets of Vancouver, to the icy white mountains of the Canadian interior, to the beautiful and dangerous island where she will face her most terrifying demon. All to save a girl she wishes had never been born.

The problem is that as soon as you realize the similarities to the Dragon Tatoo series you start to compare and we all know that no one can compare to Larsson.

Action packed plot: makes the book an irresistable page turner. Contrary to what Gisela said, you\'ll want to take this book to the washroom with you. ""The Lost Ones"" hooks up with the traditions of gritty, grungy urban naturalism while exposing us to the polyvalent nature of Nature, beautiful ghostly, lush, ghastly, inhabited by billionaires and monsters (not mutually-exclusive categories).

I stupidly started reading it on my phone at 11PM (I had ordered a physical copy and I was waiting for it to arrive and decided to read the first chapter) and I could not stop reading! I was hyperventilating because I kept holding my breathe cause of the cuteness and gasping. At 1AM I decided to message 10 people telling them they had to read this book ASAP, immediately 4 people messaged me back saying they bought it (I don’t think I’ve ever been so proud). I finally forced myself to stop reading and savour the book for tomorrow.This was the cutest thing ever!It was so much fun and I loved the banter!I basically couldn’t breathe during this whole book because I was constantly holding my breathe and gasping out loud, everything was so cute and made me breathless. I thought I was going to pass out because it was so amazing.I loveeee Olivia she’s my favourite and I loveeee Asher!I do have to say at first I thought it was strange how Olivia bought her boss stuff without his consent and to his house because I was a publicity intern and didn’t do that but then again my boss didn’t make me get his lunch or coffee. You have to suspend your belief and think of it like a hate to love movie because those aren’t always realistic either.\n\n', '\n\n  Endearing, funny, heart warming - a delightful read that sucks you in and has you wanting to finish it in a single sitting.Two over the top characters, one borderline aggressively friendly and the other unnecessarily sour. The interactions between them, with an underlining Christmas setting makes for such an enjoyable read. The author has managed to weave current serious topics of sexism, sexual harassment and nods to the #metoo movement while still having an overall lighthearted tone with some unexpected plot turns.\n\n', '\n\n  This book was - in a word - CHRISTMASSY! I went in knowing three things: this book had a fake dating trope, a hate-to-lovers trope, and it was Christmassy to the max. And I came out falling in love with a new book! I truly adored this read, the writing was very well done and the story was so enthralling I consumed the whole story in one day, reading bits of it whenever I could at work throughout the day and then binged the rest of it when I got home. Highly recommend!!\n\n', ""\n\n  I thought this book was INCREDIBLY entertaining and interesting. I managed to read it in a single day and couldn't put it down.\n\n"", '\n\n  I found it to be a very monotone storyline. Very little pizazz, but a pretty quick and straight forward book.\n\n', '\n\n  Faking Under the Mistletoe was an absolute delight. This story was hilarious, but also packed a surprisingly emotional punch I didn’t expect.Olivia is Christmas cheer personified, while Asher is a grinchy grump who basically wants nothing to do with Christmas...or with Olivia. She doesn’t let either of those things deter her, though, and she manages to get under his skin every chance she gets. I loved these two; Olivia was absolutely hilarious, and both she and Asher had so many layers. They seemed so incompatible, and yet they worked together and made each other better. Their interactions ranged from laugh out loud funny to frustrating to touching to steamy, and everything in between. Their chemistry was SO hot, and I loved watching them go from barely tolerating each other to caring for each other to something more.I expected this book to be light and funny and fluffy because that’s how it started out, but it also dealt with some really serious - and timely - issues. There were times when my heart hurt so much for Olivia and I just wanted to scoop her up and protect her. She was so strong, and I admired how she dealt with things and how much she grew.Faking Under the Mistletoe had just about everything I love in contemporary romance - it was funny, emotional, steamy, well written, and had great characters (main characters and side characters - Asher’s niece Chloe is the same age as my niece, and her hilarious comments, observations, and questions reminded me so much of my niece). I know I’ll be recommending this book a lot this holiday season and for many more to come!*I received an advance copy of this book from the author in exchange for honest consideration\n\n', ""\n\n  This was a real pleasure to read. I really enjoyed Asher and Olivia, they were such a joy to read about. It was a great holiday read, had all the Christmas feels but also had some real life issues which for me made it better. It's not just a holiday feel good book it actually has depth and emotion, @ashleysheperd did an amazing job.•From the beginning I fell in love with Olivia, she's such a fun, determined, quirky, sweet character very relatable and I wish I had a friend like her. Asher was very detestable from the beginning but as the story moves on you can't help but fall in love with him also. The writing was so amazing, the dialogues just flowed perfectly. The enemies to lover relationship developed perfectly, wasn't rushed and wasn't dragged, it's the perfect holiday read !•Honestly if you can get your hands on this book you won't be disappointed it's free with KU and it's definitely worth it. If you love enemies to lover and Christmas this one is perfect for you.\n\n"", '\n\n  I really enjoyed this read! A lot of Christmas romances can be a bit hokey but this was really enjoyable and believable. Loved the characters, Olivia is awesome. I will say I wish there was a bit more to the ending, and that there was more explanation / backstory on side characters (I don’t often lose track of who’s who in a book, but with this one I did a bit). Otherwise this was really well written and a lot of fun to read. Would definitely pick up this author again!\n\n']"

Each unpredictable twist and turn throws the reader into every scene, living and experiencing as if there.\n\n', '\n\n  Rich characterization and a page-turning plot makes for a fast-paced, and interesting story. This is the third in the Kate Marshall series following “Nine Elms” and “Shadow Sands”.  Anyone who missed reading the first two novels in the series should have no qualms about reading “Darkness Falls” as enough background information is included that it reads very well as a stand-alone novel. However, I think it enriches the reading experience if you read the series in order to get the complete backstory of the characters.I enjoyed Kate Marshall’s character and her relationships with her assistant, and her son. All were rich and believable. Kate has more baggage than most women in their forties and she is working hard to leave it behind her – including her longing for alcohol. A ‘day at a time’ battle that she is determined to overcome.The atmospheric locale added greatly to my enjoyment of the novel.The narrative is well-balanced between the ‘case’ and Kate’s home life. This time out the duo seek to achieve what the police have failed to do in twelve years. They want to find out what became of the journalist Joanna Duncan. Also, this story tells of their efforts to maintain the caravan park and dive shop that were part of Kate’s inheritance from Myra.“Darkness Falls” probes themes of duplicity and crimes against gay men.The ending was the perfect denouement to show how they solved the case and also as a lead-up to the next Kate Marshall title which is highly anticipated by me.Highly recommended to all lovers of intelligent crime fiction.\n\n', '\n\n  Robert Bryndza is back with another intense crime thriller with Kate Marshall at the helm. With a sordid past as a police detective, Kate has opened up her own investigative agency and is ready to take on the world. She’s given a cold case, where a journalist disappeared twelve years before. While there are some possible avenues to explore, the police have given up. All that being said, Kate and her partner begin finding a new and interesting connection with some other cold cases in the area, which could be the momentum they need to acquire answers.Kate Marshall had high hopes when she worked for the Metropolitan Police, but addiction and other skeletons in her closet kept her from being able to stay on the right path. She’s taken her skills and turned it into something great, opening a private investigative agency, supplementing her time as a lecturer at the local university. Working with her partner, Tristan Harper, Kate is hoping to make a name for herself and earn a decent living.When she’s given a cold case, Kate has high hopes that she and Tristan will be able to solve it. A journalist went missing twelve years before, one who was gritty and determined like few others. She’d brought down a sitting Member of Parliament for potential indiscretions, but he had a solid alibi for the time of the disappearance. Working through the police files given over by the family, Kate and Tristan come across some names that do not seem to fit.Deeper digging reveals that these were young men who went missing in the years before the journalist’s disappearance. They frequented gay bars and some had a connection of a commune in the area. The more Kate and Tristan push, the stronger the potential connection of the disappearances. Could someone have been trying to write a story, connecting the missing men to someone around the bars?All the while, a killer lurks just out of sight. Their target is one of the seedy bars on the outskirts of town. When a young man is found raped and murdered, Kate cannot help but wonder if there is a connection to the cold cases she has on her radar. Forensics makes some connections, but there is nothing to tie these disappearances to any particular killer. Still, things may be slowly coming together, but at what cost? Another great novel by Robert Bryndza that will keep readers flipping pages into the night.I always enjoy a great thriller and Robert Bryndza has never failed to deliver. His attention to detail is like no other and he finds intriguing ways to keep the reader engaged throughout. The stories are not outlandish, but neither are they plain and easily deduced. This is the second of Bryndza’s series that I have tried, which is equally as intense and has me wanting more.Kate Marshall has a major backstory that continues to reveal itself here. While series fans will know some of her past, Kate is still trying to come to terms with them, as things emerge to remind her of where she was all those years before. Bryndza allows for some wonderful character development here, both professional and personal, which offers Kate Marshall a new perspective as she is getting her life in order. I am eager to see where things will take her in the coming novels, as I am ready for more as soon as possible.Robert Bryndza is an amazing writer with strong capabilities. He writes well and keeps the story moving along. The narrative builds from the opening chapter and there is no time at which I felt things dragged. The story evolved well, using short chapters to tease the reader into pushing forward just a little more. Tackling social and societal issues amongst the murder investigation, Bryndza does not shy away from topics and keeps the reader educated throughout the experience. I can only hope for more, as he has a knack when it comes to crimes thrillers!Kudos, Mr. Bryndza, for another winner. Don’t keep us wondering for too long, as your fans surely love what you have to offer.\n\n', '\n\n  Darkness Falls is another gripping thriller in the Kate Marshall series.Kate and her partner Tristan are getting their detective agency up and running on a cold case that involves the disappearance of journalist Joanna Duncan.At the same time gay men are disappearing and being murdered.Did Joanna know something that the police did not?Robert Bryndza does a great job leaving clues and red herrings and once again he out smarted this reader.Thought I knew but I was wrong.I thoroughly enjoy anything written by Mr. Bryndza and the Kate Marshall series is no exception.  I have my fingers crossed for book 4 and I will be first in line.\n\n', ""\n\n  I absolutely loved this book!Robert Bryndza is a new author for me and I'm so glad to have found his work. In Darkness Falls he has penned a well written, intriguing mystery that keeps you guessing right until the very end. The book is definitely a page turner!The book itself is easy to read, with rich descriptions that contain just enough detail to help you picture the settings and people without tipping over into so much that it distracts from the story. The main characters have depth and are relatable, and the author makes you care about what happens to them.I highly recommend this book to any and all lovers of mysteries.\n\n"", ""\n\n  Private detective Kate Marshall and her partner Tristan Harper are hired by Bev and her friend Bill to investigate the disappearance years before of Bev's daughter Joanna, a journalist.

  Astronauts explore an alien spacecraft hurtling toward the sun in this Hugo and Nebula Award–winning novel—“a stone-cold classic” of hard sci-fi (The Guardian).   An enormous cylindrical object has entered Earth’s solar system on a collision course with the sun. A team of astronauts are sent to explore the mysterious craft, which the denizens of the solar system name Rama. What they find is astonishing evidence of a civilization far more advanced than ours. They find an interior stretching over fifty kilometers; a forbidding cylindrical sea; mysterious and inaccessible buildings; and strange machine-animal hybrids, or “biots,” that inhabit the ship. But what they don’t find is an alien presence. So who—and where—are the Ramans?   Often listed as one of Clarke’s finest novels, Rendezvous with Rama won numerous awards, including the Hugo, the Nebula, the Jupiter, and the British Science Fiction Awards. A fast-paced and compelling story of an enigmatic encounter with alien technology, Rendezvous with Rama offers both answers and unsolved mysteries that will continue to fascinate readers for generations.   “Mr. Clarke is splendid . . .

  There are a lot of places I’d rather spend Christmas Eve morning than on a cold, snowy sidewalk outside someone else’s home. I’d kill to be sitting beside a fireplace, drinking cocoa, wearing flannel pajamas and reading a book.Instead, I’m here, standing in front of my one-night stand’s house, working up the courage to ring the doorbell and tell him I’m pregnant.I hate that term—one-night stand.

Plus both of them are older than Aida and Nessa in prior books and neither have this romanticized vision of life and love.Camille is an adult, who grew up fast and knows who she is and despite what she feels, she came across CONFIDENT!Nero has always seemed so aloof, so seeing him suddenly feel responsible and vulnerable was such a welcome change. Eager to see bits and pieces of them in the rest of the series to see how their relationship evolves.

As a member of the Gallo family – the Italian mafia, he’s a man of action and a risk-taker with a devil-may-care attitude and a well-earned reputation for getting into trouble.  I loved Camille!  She was hard working, feisty, smart and quick with a clever comeback when taunted with insults meant to belittle her.  I enjoyed how Nero and Camille first connected through their mutual love of classic cars.  As a mechanic herself, she truly was the rare female who could keep him intrigued outside of the bedroom.  As a couple these two were drawn together like steel to a magnet forming a tight connection through their similar life experiences.While this story is a bit of a departure from the chaos and vengeful scheming we’ve witnessed in the previous tales, it does contain some violence along with plenty of drama, action, adventure and suspense.  I didn’t find the romance particularly dark though, despite some intense chemistry and several seriously steamy encounters.I received a free copy of this book via Hidden Gems and am voluntarily leaving a review.\n\n', '\n\n  This is book three in the Brutal Birthright series. Wow, Nero is full of surprises, the man has some layers to him. How much good can be inside the son of the Italian mafia? Camille is a complex character herself, she is a good girl but she appears to have a little darkness inside as well. Nero and Camille bring out mostly the best out of one another, even when they banned together to commit a crime. I sat down to get started on this book and looked at the clock, two hours had already past! This book will pull you in immediately, it contains twists and turns that drive the story forward and challenge the characters. Nero and Camille figure out they make a good team while they also find themselves in an unlikely but steamy relationship. Enjoy this amazing book! Check out the series if you have not as the Griffins and the Gallos have plenty of siblings that have a story to share.

One being racing, I was a tomboy growing up and loved to race, so this was kind of right up my alley. Nero is the third son of the Gallo crime family and he's been around. Not one girl had captured his attention until he chanced upon Camille. They seemed to keep running into one another at different times. I really suggest you grab this one, you don't have to read the previous two in this series, but I would recommend that you do, this series is amazing. I can not wait for the next one.

When his family home in Milan is destroyed by Allied bombs, Pino joins an underground railroad helping Jews escape over the Alps, and falls for Anna, a beautiful widow six years his senior.In an attempt to protect him, Pino’s parents force him to enlist as a German soldier—a move they think will keep him out of combat. But after Pino is injured, he is recruited at the tender age of eighteen to become the personal driver for Adolf Hitler’s left hand in Italy, General Hans Leyers, one of the Third Reich’s most mysterious and powerful commanders.Now, with the opportunity to spy for the Allies inside the German High Command, Pino endures the horrors of the war and the Nazi occupation by fighting in secret, his courage bolstered by his love for Anna and for the life he dreams they will one day share.Fans of All the Light We Cannot See, The Nightingale, and Unbroken will enjoy this riveting saga of history, suspense, and love.

The hero of the tale is Pino Lella, and Italian boy, only seventeen years old when he is enlisted by a catholic priest to aid him in leading Jews and downed airmen over the Italian Alp to Switzerland.  After some harrowing experiences doing just that, Pino leaves the area and returns to Milan.  His parents insist that he joins the German occupiers army so that he will not be conscripted and end up on the Russian Front..  Nearly immediately he is enlisted to become the driver for the highest ranking Nazi in Italy.  As soon as this is made known to the Italian resistance, they call upon him to spy as he now has access to the German war machines plans for Italy.And just around the same time, he meets and falls in love with a girl.  She is working as a maid for the mistress of his boss,  General Hans Leyers.  The love story of these two is an important part of the tale.The atrocities he viewed, the death and destructtion he lived with on a daily basis, would have been too much for most to bear, but somehow,  this young man, only eighteen years old performed the duties he felt he owed to his country and country men with bravery above and beyond what is normal.These secrets and many others he kept all his life.  After the war he moved to the U.S.A. and lived a decent life but kept mum about his wartime experiences until Mark Sullivan, the author, was able to convince him to tell his story.  I, for one, am glad he did.  Historically, this gave me a much better picture of Italy during the war and the brave men and woman who risked their lives to go up against the Germans who occupied their territory as they had their original enemies, like Poland, France and the Netherlands.\n\n', '\n\n  This is, hands down, one of the very best WW2 books I\'ve ever read.  I was constantly shaking my head in amazement at the things Pino went through, his attitude all through the war, his never-ending readiness and desire to ""do the right thing.""  Mark Sullivan did an excellent job in writing this book, he made Pino so real to me that I feel as if I\'ve sat at the table and visited with him.  Beautiful, beautiful job.  Thank you to Pino for all he did and thank you to Mark Sullivan for telling his incredible story.\n\n', ""\n\n  Beneath a Scarlet Sky is so smoothly written that it feels like I'm watching a poignant documentary on TV. The characters are true to life and I feel what they feel as if I were there. But, it's Italy, WW2. Not a good time to be in Italy. We live through the war with the lead character, a teenager turning rapidly into a man. As he balances being drafted against becoming a member of the resistance and likely a short life...well. either way it could be very short...another option presents itself. He can wear a Nazi uniform and drive for the #2 Nazi commander, essentially becoming a spy for the Allies. As a driver he becomes deeply aware of troubling decisions which he reports back. Compensation for his danger comes in meeting a beautiful girl whom he falls in love with. Together they hope to see things through safely to the end of the war. But Fate is not kind. The Nazis do not retreat from Italy as the war bends in favor of Allied troops. The people of Italy suffer dreadfully as the Nazis hang on...Until they rise up and attack the Nazi overlords in support of the Allied invasion. Lives are lost. It is the price of freedom, a price that leaves deep scars even for courageous heroes. You will feel their losses and rejoice in their victories.\n\n"", '\n\n  At the outset of World War II, Pino Lella is a normal Italian teenager. But, when the Nazis invade Italy, he is sent to a monastery in the Alps, where he is embroiled in plan to sneak Jews across the Swiss border to safety. On reaching his 18th birthday, his parents force him to enlist with the Nazis in order to ride out the war unharmed. Unable to stomach collaboration, Pino becomes a spy for the resistance.What I liked about this book was the insight into an aspect of the war I had never learned of before. Book stores are full of war stories from England, France and the Netherlands. There are even a fair few holocaust stories set within Germany or Poland. Yet, this is the first time I\'ve read anything about Italy, one of the axis powers, during World War II. Until reading this book, I did not know, because I had never thought of it, that many Italians resisted not only the Nazis, but Mussolini as well. I also did not know that priests, bishops and other church officials were actively engaged in smuggling Jews to safety.As for the rest, I wasn\'t terribly impressed. The writing leans far too heavily on tell on not nearly enough on show. This does switch somewhat towards the end, but it made getting to the end a struggle. The characters were two-dimensional. I just couldn\'t find a way to relate to them.Throughout the narrative, I kept wondering if perhaps the author relied too much on the word of Pino Lella himself. In the story, Pino is so constantly heroic, so consistently exceeds any expectation of a boy his age (expert mountaineer, fluent in three languages, expert race car driver, gifted piano player without seeming to ever practice) that it comes across as bordering on propaganda.If you are fascinated by war stories, you may enjoy ""Beneath a Scarlet Sky,"" but it\'s probably more well suited to young adults.\n\n', ""\n\n  I never read war novels. I don't like how the violence and emotion inherent in war play with my senses and seem to scar my imagination, and my zest for life. I am, however, an avid reader and especially appreciate novels that are based on true stories. Beneath A Scarlet Sky took that which I detest and that which I love and weaved it so poignantly and beautifully together in a single masterpiece that I could not stop reading until the end was known and the questions were answered. So engrossed was I its content and backstory, that I relished even the acknowledgements as they lent substance and credibility to this work of art. Highly recommend.\n\n""]"

I also wanted a little more anger from Flynn towards the Duke for being the instigator of 'his best friend', Flynn's Father's death.I like how Collette included other characters from previous books and a little play-by-play to tempt us towards the coming novels. I kept flipping back and forth to my books TBR to check as to where they fit and if I had read their stories yet.  That was my only hic-up. I kind of wish she hadn't included as much info in the epilogue as I think a pairing (or two) are mentioned that haven't been written yet and will be a future 'Romancing a Scot Series' book.I truly enjoyed this book and eagerly await the next in the series.

  Now available in one collection, four classic crime thrillers from the award-winning “French master of noir” (Observer)Unravelling like a paranoid nightmare, Bird in a Cage melds existentialist drama with thrilling noir to tell the story of a man trapped in a prison of his own making. Crush is a chilling 1950s suspense story of youthful naivety, dark obsession—and the slippery slope to murder. The Executioner Weeps is the winner of the 1957 Grand Prix de Littérature Policière. And The Gravedigger's Bread is a claustrophobic thriller about love gone wrong. All from the French master of noir.In Bird in a Cage, trouble is the last thing Albert needs. Traveling back to his childhood home on Christmas Eve to mourn his mother’s death, he finds the loneliness and nostalgia of his Parisian quartier unbearable. Until, that evening, he encounters a beautiful, seemingly innocent woman at a brasserie, and his spirits are lifted. Still, something about the woman disturbs him. Where is the father of her child? And what are those two red stains on her sleeve? When she invites him back to her apartment, Albert thinks he’s in luck. But a monstrous scene awaits them, and he finds himself lured into the darkness against his better judgment.Crush: Bored with her mundane factory job, her nagging mother, and her alcoholic father-in-law, 17-year-old Louise Lacroix is captivated by a glamorous American couple who moves to her industrial hometown in Northern France. The Roolands' home is an island of color, good humor, and easy living in drab 1950s Léopoldville—a place straight out of Louise’s dreams. Louise is thrilled when she successfully convinces the couple to hire her as their maid. But once she is under their roof, their model life starts to fall apart. Painful secrets from their past emerge, cracks in their relationship appear, and a dark obsession begins to grow. In The Executioner Weeps, it was fate that led her to step out in front of the car. A quiet mountain road. A crushed violin. And a beautiful woman lying motionless in the ditch. Carrying her back to his lodging on a beach near Barcelona, Daniel discovers that the woman is still alive but that she remembers nothing—not even her own name. And soon he has fallen for her mysterious allure. She is a blank canvas, a perfect muse, and his alone. But when Daniel travels to France in search of her past, he slips into a tangled vortex of lies, depravity, and murder. The Gravedigger's Bread: Blaise should never have hung around in that charmless little provincial town. The job offer that attracted him in the first place had failed to materialize. He should have got on the first train back to Paris, but Fate decided otherwise. After a chance encounter with a beautiful blonde in the town post-office, Blaise is hooked. He realizes he'll do anything to stay by her side, and soon finds himself working for her husband, a funeral director. But the tension in this strange love triangle begins to mount, and eventually results in a highly unorthodox burial.   Read more  ",[],[],[]

RH are those romance tropes that are either done really well or are books that contain a lot of group activities but no decent plot. The Boys of Briar Hall is a RH series that has been done really well. The second book answered some of my questions from the first book…but left me with a lot more questions than answers.Ava Jade is a really well written female heroine. I love it when authors write RH and the female is a force to be reckoned with. Ava Jade is a take no prisoners type of female. She is not going to sit around and let these men dictate what she can and cannot do. Stealing the door knobs had to have been one of the best comically written scenes in a RH that I’ve ever read. This female is not someone to be messed with.There is a lot of action packed chapters. This story is not a slow burn. From the very first book, the author is taking us along for a ride and we’re just doing our best to hold on for dear life. Absolutely fantastic book. Cannot wait for the next one.I was provided an advanced reader copy in exchange for an honest review.\n\n', '\n\n  This is one excellent RH read. Ava Jade is a total BA and I want to be her friend! Rook is my #1 but Grey is also awesome and Corvus has his moments. The storyline is action packed and suspense filled with pockets of spice. I am so eager for the next book.\n\n', ""\n\n  I will not be reading the last one. It's very disappointing what happens in the end. Not to mention how difficult Ava is through 8ut the whole book  making mountains out of mole hills.Nobody likes a snitch.\n\n"", '\n\n  What an intense roller coaster ride!  Ava Jade is fierce and untrusting. Can she find a way to fix everything. That ending  though….. wow… can’t wait for the next book. Great series!\n\n', '\n\n  Oh my mother tucking duck....this is an amazing read the story flow is fabulos and I could. Not put it down!!\n\n', '\n\n  I love the characters and her strength. definitely recommend this read. I look forward to finding out more about each character.\n\n', '\n\n  “She was the ember that would ignite us, spurring us into a forest fire that would eat all our enemies away, rendering them to ashes.  We would burn together. She was the catalyst we’d been waiting for.”OMG! Hold on tight because this story is about to blow you away and take you on one hell of a twisted ride of bloody violence and spicy deliciousness! I was riveted to my seat, biting my nails with anticipation and curling my toes from all of the raw desire in every chapter. I never wanted this story to end but when it did OMFG that  ending sucker punched me in the face!Ava Jade is one hell of a MF badass! She is so damn fierce, slightly unhinged and utterly uncontrollable. I love everything about her! The connection that she is slowly forging with the Crows is intense but fragile and could break at any moment. The desire and burning passion that is growing between all of them will have your toes curling and your panties combusting with its intensity and heat! These four are perfect for each other but they all have darkness and demons that they need to destroy in order for Ava Jade to make it past the trials in one piece.There are so many secrets, betrayals and twisted moments throughout that will leave you wondering how this is all going to turn out in the end. It’s one wild rollercoaster ride.This is a well written story with deliciously dark and damaged characters, gut-wrenching emotional moments, twists and turns that will shock you, and an ending that will leave you begging to know what happens next!Highly recommend for all dark romance lovers.\n\n', '\n\n  Picking up where book 1 ended, we are thrust right back into the story. There was a lot more information given and many questions from book one were finally answered. Although there was no shortage of questions after this book.I loved that we began to see the interactions between AJ and the boys change. I felt this book was more about their changing relationships and getting to know them more than moving forward with the plot. There were some new plot points but it was slower than book 1. This didn’t make the book less interesting, it actually made the story developments that occurred mean more.That ending left me needing to know how book 3 will continue the story. It wasn’t really a cliffhanger, more of a “oh this is going to be good.”\n\n']"

  Katherine Arden’s bestselling debut novel spins an irresistible spell as it announces the arrival of a singular talent with a gorgeous voice.   “A beautiful deep-winter story, full of magic and monsters and the sharp edges of growing up.”—Naomi Novik, bestselling author of UprootedWinter lasts most of the year at the edge of the Russian wilderness, and in the long nights, Vasilisa and her siblings love to gather by the fire to listen to their nurse’s fairy tales. Above all, Vasya loves the story of Frost, the blue-eyed winter demon. Wise Russians fear him, for he claims unwary souls, and they honor the spirits that protect their homes from evil. Then Vasya’s widowed father brings home a new wife from Moscow. Fiercely devout, Vasya’s stepmother forbids her family from honoring their household spirits, but Vasya fears what this may bring. And indeed, misfortune begins to stalk the village.  But Vasya’s stepmother only grows harsher, determined to remake the village to her liking and to groom her rebellious stepdaughter for marriage or a convent. As the village’s defenses weaken and evil from the forest creeps nearer, Vasilisa must call upon dangerous gifts she has long concealed—to protect her family from a threat sprung to life from her nurse’s most frightening tales.Praise for The Bear and the Nightingale“Arden’s debut novel has the cadence of a beautiful fairy tale but is darker and more lyrical.”—The Washington Post“Vasya [is] a clever, stalwart girl determined to forge her own path in a time when women had few choices.”—The Christian Science Monitor“Stunning . . . will enchant readers from the first page. . . . with an irresistible heroine who wants only to be free of the bonds placed on her gender and claim her own fate.”—Publishers Weekly (starred review)“Utterly bewitching . . . a lush narrative . . . an immersive, earthy story of folk magic, faith, and hubris, peopled with vivid, dynamic characters, particularly clever, brave Vasya, who outsmarts men and demons alike to save her family.”—Booklist (starred review) “An extraordinary retelling of a very old tale . . .

It is my all time favourite series because it is dark, gloomy but shows the human potential. I also love Neil Gaiman, Terry Pratchett......It has the right amount of romance with a perfect twist. The characters were brilliantly described, real and relatable. This book speaks of humanity,  determinism, love and questions the perception of bad and good. I can see that hard core religious people will not like it as it touches on fanaticism, blame and desire. I read reviews that complained about this very subject- that he author gave her ""subjective"" view on religion. HOW dare she speaks her mind and is being critical!! The story takes place in the medieval time of Russia after all. Kathrin Arden beautifully depicts that coexisting with one another is of essence and the price we pay if we choose to not do so. I will definitely read it again.\n\n', '\n\n  An engaging, dark fantasy mired in Russian folklore. It is a fast moving book that captures you, weaves you into the frigid forests of northern Rus’ and delivers an enchanting story line with an irresistibly likeable protagonist. It’s full of magic and monsters, heartache and a dash of romance. The communion with old world Magicks is nearly palpable.\n\n', ""\n\n  I haven't read any other reviews, so I may be repeating what others have already said.What I liked: You can tell that the author did put a fair amount of time into researching the period. I loved the details about the food, medieval Russian iconography, the social aspects of the countryside vs the city, and so on (don't worry, it's not dry at all, just details sprinkled in for flavour). I also enjoyed the way she played with Slavic mythology, and the characterization was generally very well-done - every character had a distinct personality and different and realistic motivations. I enjoyed the fairy-tale aspects, the introduction to the various folkloric entities, and the way the mythological world interacted with the mundane.What I didn't like so much: While there were many tropes present in this story that I greatly enjoyed, the main character, Vasya, came across as a bit of a Mary Sue. It's hard to explain why I feel this way, because the usual traits - for example, everyone loving her regardless of her actions - aren't present. People do dislike Vasya, and sometimes for very good reason. I think it may have been the narrative, and not Vasya herself, that makes me feel this way. She is described often as very fey, strangely alluring, and so on (and she has no idea, of course), in a way that I consciously noticed and pulled me out of the story as I was reading. (There is an important character for whom Vasya is a figure of temptation, and there is symbology and psychology present there to explain his intense feelings, and I actually enjoyed that aspect - it isn't the part that bothers me.) I get that she might be beautiful, and creepy men will absolutely sexualize a teenage girl who is not at all trying to seduce them, but the way the narrative is written implies that Vasya's appeal is factual and not subjective. If it is due to her particular connection to the otherworld, like an aura she projects that gives her this strange appeal despite herself, I hope it is explained in the other books so that I can understand why everyone is apparently being affected by something like a fey glamour.Keep in mind that the above is just a personal pet peeve, but something to look out for if you happen to share it. The book is still a lot of fun, especially if you're interested in stories based on fairy tales, Russian and Slavic folklore, or even the interaction of medieval Christianity with pagan traditions. It reminded me of Naomi Novic's 'Uprooted', which I also enjoyed, but the characters are different enough that it didn't feel repetitive.\n\n"", ""\n\n  Not bad, if you love russian folklore, you'll find some interest, but it's in an old school style. Meaning, the heroine is a girl and well, everybody try to control her. It's kind of historical, I know it's the point, but it would be nice for a change that the family of the girl is actually on her side ... Anyway. Still, there is amazing character (I'm not gonna be a spoiler). The author make great references for anybody who know at least a bit of russian and it is well written. Quick read, it's nice, but probably one time was enough.\n\n"", '\n\n  Excellent! The story reminds me of being a child and disappearing into fairy tales. Strong heroine with none of the swooning foolishness of so many women in fantasy novels... the final scene is riveting! Looking forward to more from this author!\n\n', '\n\n  Great easy read...makes a great beach read! I don’t know much about Russian folklore but you really don’t need to in order to enjoy this story. The author does a great job of explaining certain words in a glossary at the end of the book..which I found helpful. The characters are great and I felt the story progressed at a good pace. Overall great read. This is also book 1 of a trilogy which I’m looking forward to reading.\n\n', '\n\n  Beautiful book. First time reading fantasy genre and I reay enjoyed this. Great characters. Perfect for a cozy winter night\n\n', '\n\n  Arden has created a delightful and engaging fusion of fiction and folklore, vividly set in the raw beauty of a harsh environment that juxtaposes the cycles of nature with the forces of life and living, and dying and death. The heroine is grounded within herself and learns the strength that comes from refusing to allow fear to overcome courage.\n\n']"

How deeply they cared for each other, how they denied themselves because of how they came into each other’s lives.Kandi Steiner never fails to inject the angst with precision when she wants to and this one definitely had my heart aching at points. I felt their sorrow as much as their joy when they let their guards down.I’m not normally a medical trope reader but I’m definitely looking forward to Harloe Rae’s instalment in this engaging series!

I haven't read a lot of age gap romances with the woman being older, but this novel was particularly well executed. It also features the son's best friend trope so I was even more invested with this ilicit added aspect.This story between Greg, a dedicated anestesiologiest and Amanda, a newly single forty-seven-year old woman was a sweet slow burn. I enjoyed how they share this profound and effortless bond despite their age difference. Their relationship starts as a lovely friendship. They both begin to truly live after years spent focusing one the hospital for Greg and years dedicated to her son and abusing husband for Amanda. It was really beautiful to see how Greg was so understanding of Amanda's doubts and insecurities. It was so easy to see how much he care deeply for her. He certainly made her feel like she's worth it! The way Amanda blossoms under his care was exquisite to witness!Although I liked this story a lot, I must say that the first half of the book was progressing too slowly in my opinion and I lost interest at times.

Everything will have you flipping through these pages as fast as you can. And Greg,\xa0 just wow. He is about as perfect as they come and is easily one of my favourite Kandi men! Amanda is real and raw and I just loved her journey. I actually don't think I've ever read an age gap with the woman being older before. Why, I have no clue, but this one was probably the best one to pop my cherry with because it was just unbelievably beautiful and heartfelt. I soaked this story up and it gave me everything. One of the best books I've read this year!\n\n"", ""\n\n  This book is a perfect May December romance. I loved that Amanda was the older of the two and that added taboo factor of Greg being her sons friend just pushed it to a whole other level. As always I was completely drawn deeply into this world and didn't want to surface until the last word was read. This one brought all the feels including those butterfly inducing moments as you wait for the big moment to happen and then it does and your life feels complete.Cannot wait for the next installments in the Bayside Heros series including:Screwed up by Harloe RaeFired Up by K.K.

It has all the signature drama, damaged characters and exquisitely gritty sex scenes that makes a Sav R. Miller book so damn difficult to put down but there's an emotional element to this book that was so relatable and personal that it brought me to tears.The level of tragedy Riley has experienced is almost unfathomable to have survived and Aiden's level of celebrity is not something most would ever know yet I was so drawn to them. Their desire to be seen and loved yet wanting to hide their imperfections at the same time for fear of being unloveable is so universal. I love how it brought a dark sense of reality to this story making it all the more enjoyable because it resonated.This is a story to lose yourself in and just feel it all. From the exposing of every painful truth they wish would stay buried to revelling in every moment of light and softness that happens no matter how small. Riley and Aiden are damaged but not broken. The depth of their chemistry and attraction was so strong, it grabs and pulls you into their orbit. They fall in love in all the most imperfect of ways and I couldn't get enough of how it could feel so wrong but right at the same time.AND let's just be clear, this is not a retelling of the myth of Orpheus & Eurydice either so anyone expecting one can put their freaking 1-star reviews away.

T. GeissingerWho knew being kidnapped in the parking garage in your best friends building could become an event worthy of an Emmy, No an Oscar.Let’s talk about Sloane! Although I was impressed with her comedy ability in Ruthless Creatures, I’m all in for giving her comedian of the year. Except the more we learn about Sloane the more we see where this funny Sloane comes from and the more I want to nominate her woman of the year. She is one strong woman!The man in charge though, dear lord, when Declan speaks, whispers, laughs I can hear that Irish lilt in my ears, his husky voice, there were parts of this book where I got shivers down my spine just thinking about his beautiful Irish brogue.Moving on from that voice, this anti-hero, this dominant, this man and those blue eyes…you can see them in your mind can’t you. The hot molten looks he gives Sloane, the small swirl of steam that gives over to that rush of everything that sets your inside on fire and ends up with that satisfying smile afterwards. These two are so connected it’s like it has been ordained by the gods.These two go from an OMG she’s crazy to dear god I am obsessed relationship. She makes him smile, she makes him hot, she makes him want to forget about who he really is and he hopes she never finds out. For Sloane it’s the fact that Declan is like no other man she has known and she isn’t sure how to handle him but she will learn.As I got closer to the end I thought, I can’t be almost done I need more of these two. Their story moved quickly, it changed; it made you give second thought to some of the characters. You don’t ever realize you are flipping those pages; there were no one more chapters, and for now it is done!So we wait, we wait to find out how this all ends and I can honestly say that ending, I did not see that coming! Do you hear that tap, tap, tap?  That’s me waiting for Savage Hearts to drop!\n\n', ""\n\n  I didn't think I could love any other book in this series more so than Nat and Kages, I was wrong.

She brings men to their knees within minutes of talking to them. Absolutely love her. When I grow up...I want to be like Sloane.This book is so good. Sloane getting kidnapped by the Irish mafia. This story gives us a little captive romance. The bdsm theme translates into this book as well. Love the smut. It was so great to see a character like Sloane be dominated. The woman eats men for breakfast.I love how each of the books in the series are connected. The author knows just how to end the story and leave us with a cliffhanger.

Meeting Sloane in Ruthless Creatures had me so excited for this book and I was not disappointed. The very first chapter alone had me laughing out loud. Sloane is hilarious. She’s also tough as nails, nothing fazes her. Not many people would take being kidnapped in stride, and that only annoys Declan. But he sees through her sass. He is total bad a** swoon. And they light this book on fire. Not everything was for me, but this was a page turner for me I couldn’t put down. Complete with some emotion, action, suspense and twists I didn’t see coming.

We loved Sloane in Ruthless Creatures. The witty best friend who has quips, is badass and seems to have every man she meets under her spell.  Kidnapped by Declan O'Donnell it quickly becomes apparent that she's met her match! They hate each other. He is the Irish mob, she is the best friend to Nathalie who is attached to the Russian boss Kasimir (Kage). The story is funny, fast-paced, suspenseful, steamy with BDSM elements. It's a story I won't forget!\n\n"", '\n\n  This book is huge!! Huge in vocabulary and characters! Declan and Sloane…the former is the newly appointed Irish mob leader and the latter is the best friend of the Bratva leader’s fiancée. Declan kidnapped Sloane for she was the cause of death of some Irish Mob. It took awhile for Declan and Sloane to find a common ground but their bantering is hilarious. There never was a dull moment in this book… romance, passion, bondage (Yes 🔥🔥), comedy, action. You name it this book has it !Kudos to JT for another amazing book. This book is highly recommended to read and reread 😃. I don’t do that very often but I’ll make this an exception. TBR on my list again🤩\n\n', '\n\n  Sloane and Declan are made for each other!

Cannot wait for the next Queens & Monsters book!\n\n', '\n\n  Second instalment following Sloane and Declan. I didn’t realize there would be a cliffhanger and would’ve abstained until the next book in the series was out to read this one, because this is such an entertaining story. I NEED MORE NOW!

Love is a universal construct that exists cross-culturally, though it's definition is not always the same.All you have to do is google love, and you'll have thousands upon thousands of entries to get you started. If you're me, it means you spent the last 2 hours reading a bunch of that. It also means you just saw a mouse in the house, temporarily freaked out, and are now sitting with no feet anywhere near the ground.My mouse hunt revealed they're exiting under the kitchen door which means as soon as it's all sealed for the winter, no more mice.So by 8am tomorrow. NO MORE mice, but I digress.Okay, so this review might end up longer than all the rest. It is called Loch Ness Reviews for a reason.Where were we?Oh right, a definition of Love. It's something which Storm's book showcases. There are different kinds, they can develop slowly or at first sight. It can be scary, warm and fuzzy, and it can hurt as much as it can bring joy. Love makes us miserable, ecstatic, jealous, kind and comforting. The book follows two people's lives and how they become intertwined with family, friends and loss.As a good university student would to (which I'm not anymore, arguably I was not a great student either...  ), I'll showcase for you, a definition of love according to The Oxford Dictionary Online.Definition of LoveFrom the Oxford Dictionary Onlinenoun[mass noun]1a strong feeling of affection:babies fill parents with intense feelings of lovetheir love for their countrya strong feeling of affection and sexual attraction for someone:they were both in love with herwe were slowly falling in loveaffectionate greetings conveyed to someone on one's behalf:give her my lovea formula for ending an affectionate letter:take care, lots of love, Judy2a great interest and pleasure in something:his love for footballwe share a love of music3 [count noun] a person or thing that one loves:she was the love of his lifetheir two great loves are tobacco and whiskyBritish informal a friendly form of address:it's all right, love(a love) informal used in affectionate requests:don't fret, there's a love4(in tennis, squash, and some other sports) a score of zero; nil:love fifteen[apparently from the phrase play for love (i.e. the love of the game, not for money); folk etymology has connected the word with French l'oeuf 'egg', from the resemblance in shape between an egg and a zero]verb[with object]feel deep affection or sexual love for (someone):do you love me?like or enjoy very much:I'd love a cup of teaI just love dancingHaving had my share of relationships, non-relationships, questionable relationships and well lets just call some of them mistakes, I wondered what I would learn from this book about love that I didn't already know.The answer? Well I knew most of it already, but I did learn that there are some pretty decent ways to deal with loss and love and mistakes. The book deals with romantic love, parental love, compassionate and friendly love. The love between partners, family and soul mates. It also deals with the loss of all of those. It's a terribly sad and heart wrenching story, it's also simultaneously up lifting and joyous. There's peace at the end, even though there's also loss.Life goes on, and while Daly suffers from the loss of her cheating boyfriend, true love and a lasting partnership sneak up behind her.He hadn't had his flute out for a while either.They really do say that line about the sweet spot and not having his flute out for a while in that episode (s05e25). (In first person of course, I believe he says 'I haven't had my flute out in a long time.') Go ahead gafaw. I do.To prove a point though, Picard's flute makes two important debuts in the Star Trek TNG series. One, above involves Picard taking his flute out again, after not having played for a very long time. He falls in love with an enchanting 'lady', and while they don't make it and ultimately aren't right for each other, they have their time. It's a little like Daly and her cheating boyfriend except Picard isn't an ass, and there's no cheating.In the other flute episode, we see a much different side of Picard's love.In the first flute episode, Picard becomes the victim of a time well let's call it a time-issue. The planet he ends up on isn't the same as the ship's time in orbit. So after much confusion and what is on the surface of the planet a life-time, Picard learns to love his family.Hi family thinks he's just been sick, he knows he's from a 'star-ship' in the sky. He gives up and learns to love life and his 'new' family and play music. Of course, he's rescued by the end of the episode, and loses what for him has been a lifetime with a family, children and grandchildren.Who cares about Star Trek? Well clearly me, but mostly because it illustrates a point. A Colorful Life is epic in the same way that Star Trek was. It tells a timeless story that shows us we all suffer, and we are all human. Just like Star Trek, A Colorful Life doesn't give us a magic answer. It simply suggests that we live life with no regrets, and we try to be as true to ourselves a possible.Caveat: In my head I just had the terrible conversation with myself that took that in a whole different direction, because flutes are rather phallic. Then I decided to re-evaluate archetypes, then I decided maybe I'm Guinan...I do like bald men, and I Do have that hair, and I've always wanted to be 'special'. I'm pretty sure Guinan had her s*** together. I want to be like Daly the same way I'd like to have Guinan powers.I've read all of Melissa Storm's books to date. I've even read all her children's books. She has a gift. She can take words, form them into stories for children, young-adults and adults. Those stories all have a message of peace and love, and they don't ignore all the bad s*** that happens to people either. She opens up the story so the reader can identify with the characters in much the same way mass pop culture identified with the star trek actors and characters. (I swear there are normal people who like star trek out there.)Yes, that's rather crass, but there's a lot of bad-s*** going down everywhere. All you have to do is open up a newspaper, or go online to any news source.Melissa Storm's writing while at times sad and painfully real still leave us with a glimmer of hope. Her writing has helped me find a voice in this crazy world, and made me realize that even though we're all quirky and weird, there's a place for all of us.That's why this review took so damned long, and that's why it's now 930 at night and I'm eating grilled cheese. You'd think I'd stay away from thing mice like. Instead I decided to say 'screw-it' and make what I wanted to eat. Much like I've decided life can deal with me the way I am or stuff it. I'll live and love the way I choose, and with no regrets.And no, it's not just any grilled cheese.Four-cheese gorgeousness grillerIn a frying pan, put some butter.Put bottom slice of bread in frying pan on top of butter on low.Spread zucchini butter on top halfAdd Shredded Mozzerella and Moterey Jack CheeseCrumble on top of that Feta CheeseAdd sliced Havarti (about 4/1 layer same size as the bread)Season with Montreal Steak Spice, or whatever taste you desire.

Seb and Stella are my absolute favorite and have topped my top three fave series of the year and of all time. I can’t get enough of this pair. I adore their journey and all the ups and downs they navigated to get to their hea. And all the secondary characters are just as alluring and intriguing. Their stories are highly anticipated. If I could give Seb and Stella more than 5 stars I would because this series is straight fire and is worth all the stars in the sky. This conclusion to their story is what I expected and then some. The fire between the couple is straight from hell because they set these pages on fire!

  The problem with secrets is that they’re too easy to keep collecting.Luna Allen has done some things she would rather no one ever know about. She also knows that, if she could go back in time, she wouldn’t change a single thing.With three sisters she loves, a job she (mostly) adores, and a family built up of friends she’s made over the years, Luna figures everything has worked out the way it was supposed to. But when one of those secrets involves the man who signs her paycheck, she can’t find it in her to regret it. Despite the fact that he’s not the friendliest man in the world. Or the most patient.Sometimes there are things you’re better off keeping to yourself.------#1 Overall Amazon Kindle Best Seller   Read more  ","['5.0 out of 5 stars', '3.0 out of 5 stars', '4.0 out of 5 stars', '5.0 out of 5 stars', '5.0 out of 5 stars', '5.0 out of 5 stars', '5.0 out of 5 stars', '5.0 out of 5 stars']","['\nFantastic read!!\n', '\nI wish I could give higher rating\n', '\nGood book\n', '\nGreat Novel\n', '\nAmazing\n', '\nAMAZING Read!!\n', '\nLoved it!!!!\n', '\nThe queen  of slow burn\n']","['\n\n  Love, love this book!!When I saw that MZ was releasing a new book, I literally stalked Amazon for when it would be available. There are not many authors for me that I would be willing to one-click purchase without any doubt, but Mariana?? Definitely. She. Does. Not. Disappoint. She is, to me, the Queen of the Slow Burn.We have Luna. A girl who just wants to be happy. Once we find out her story, through bits and pieces of the story, we find out why. She makes a life for herself, a happy life, took care of her 3 sisters, works as a painter/restore at a customization auto body shop. She is happy, she is loved is her motto.We meet Rip. Lucas Ripley, Mr. Ripley. Co-owner of the body shop that Luna works at. Grouchy, hard-bodied hunk of a man with a past that he does not want to talk about.This is their story. Their life. MZ does a fantastic job of a) making the characters believable and b) always has a unique storyline.\n\n', '\n\n  New to me author, Mariana Zapata, was recommended by an author I follow. She is talented for her detailed & descriptive writing.The only downfall that takes this review from a ‘4 to a 3’ is the feeling the book didn’t have to be filled with so much repeated words on her internal struggle with Luna’s character (too much written on Jason, for sure).That said, Luna’s ability to bring charm to the big burly scary guy was sweet, Luna & Rip were great characters, and I loved the variety of people she called friends and family.I had to read till the end to know what happened but it was way too long, for me!  Loved Ripley and how his change was written to see little things occurring, sparking the romance feel but it was definitely a ‘slow burn’ until the end.\n\n', '\n\n  I prefer my books written in the third person. This author has a very poignant way of telling a story.too bad it’s in the first person and only shows the story through one person s point of view. Synch a waist. I wish the author would learn how to write so she can tell. Story instead of narrating it.\n\n', '\n\n  As soon as I started reading Luna and the Lie I knew I was reading something special. I tried so hard to slow myself down so I could just savour the writing and the story. But I couldn’t stop! It was so good that every page just pushed me forward till there were no more pages to read.  So, I went back and read it again! It’s that good. All I can say is just read it! I hope there might be more stories of these people ( maybe Lily?). So many metaphorical scenarios that are so relatable. This one will haunt my memory! Thank-you!\n\n', '\n\n  This author is the Queen of slow burns. It has all the elements to sweep you off your feet and fall in love with the characters. Every time you read one of her book you want to reread right away with a new perspective of the characters thoughts and motivations. This author is seriously addictive.\n\n', ""\n\n  I literally stayed up all night the evening this book was released because I just couldn't put it down. Every time I open a Mariana Zapata novel I know i'm in for an amazing ride. Her characters are relatable and hold the readers attention so that you can't help but care about them. Her heros are always hunky with a bit of mystery surrounding them and Rip was no different. I loved Luna as a character and I really wanted her to be happy throughout the entire book. I would 100% recommend this book but I should also attach a warning: once you start, you won't be able to put it down until you finish it.\n\n"", ""\n\n  I read this book in less than 2 days. Mariana has a way with words that make this story flow so beautifully. She's got wonderful characters you wish you could meet in real life.

  NEW YORK TIMES BESTSELLER • From the bestselling author of Before We Were Yours comes a dramatic historical novel of three young women searching for family amid the destruction of the post–Civil War South, and of a modern-day teacher who learns of their story and its vital connection to her students’ lives.“An absorbing historical . . . enthralling.”—Library JournalBestselling author Lisa Wingate brings to life startling stories from actual “Lost Friends” advertisements that appeared in Southern newspapers after the Civil War, as newly freed slaves desperately searched for loved ones who had been sold away.Louisiana, 1875: In the tumultuous era of Reconstruction, three young women set off as unwilling companions on a perilous quest: Hannie, a freed slave; Lavinia, the pampered heir to a now destitute plantation; and Juneau Jane, Lavinia’s Creole half sister. Each carries private wounds and powerful secrets as they head for Texas, following roads rife with vigilantes and soldiers still fighting a war lost a decade before. For Lavinia and Juneau Jane, the journey is one of stolen inheritance and financial desperation, but for Hannie, torn from her mother and siblings before slavery’s end, the pilgrimage west reignites an agonizing question: Could her long-lost family still be out there? Beyond the swamps lie the limitless frontiers of Texas and, improbably, hope.Louisiana, 1987: For first-year teacher Benedetta Silva, a subsidized job at a poor rural school seems like the ticket to canceling her hefty student debt—until she lands in a tiny, out-of-step Mississippi River town. Augustine, Louisiana, is suspicious of new ideas and new people, and Benny can scarcely comprehend the lives of her poverty-stricken students. But amid the gnarled live oaks and run-down plantation homes lie the century-old history of three young women, a long-ago journey, and a hidden book that could change everything.

Olivia\'s given us to characters I wanted to invest time in and get to know, and she managed to steer away from the usual tropes of ""whoops, I slept with the man I now realise is my new boss"" by giving us a strong female protagonist and a strong but caring and thoughtful male lead.

  As December turns Lake Eden, Minnesota, into the North Pole, the heat is on in Hannah Swensen’s kitchen to honor two Christmas promises: baking irresistible holiday cupcakes and preventing an attempted murderer from succeeding the second time around!   While Hannah speeds through a lengthy holiday checklist, drama in town grows like Santa’s waistline on Christmas Eve. Her sister Andrea wants to stave off the blues by helping out at The Cookie Jar, Michelle’s love life is becoming complicated, Lisa needs Hannah’s advice, and Delores has a Christmas secret she’s not willing to share. But nothing dampens the holiday mood more than the chilling mystery surrounding the man found near death in an abandoned storefront two doors down from Hannah’s bakery . . .   The befuddled John Doe can’t recall a thing about himself—except for his unusual knowledge of restoring antique furniture. With a smattering of clues and barely enough time to frost Christmas cookies, Hannah must solve a deadly puzzle that could leave her dashing through the snow for her life!  Features Over a Dozen Cookie and Dessert Recipes from The Cookie Jar!“Cozy fans with a sweet tooth will be more than satisfied.” —Publishers Weekly     Read more  ","['1.0 out of 5 stars', '3.0 out of 5 stars', '3.0 out of 5 stars', '2.0 out of 5 stars', '1.0 out of 5 stars', '5.0 out of 5 stars', '3.0 out of 5 stars', '5.0 out of 5 stars']","['\nVery disappointing\n', '\ncozy mystery\n', '\nJust Alright\n', '\nDisappointing: does not fit in with the series.\n', '\nWorst Hannah book Ever\n', '\nA good read.\n', '\nFast read, don’t read if you are hungry\n', '\nBook\n']","[""\n\n  Not only does this book go back in time from the last book in the series but there is no continuity with the previous books. In 'Chocolate Chip Cookie Murder', book 1 of the series, Hannah just meets Norman and Mike, her sister Andrea is a real estate agent and Andrea's daughter is four. THIS book is further down in time where Norman and Mike are 'family', but Andrea is not employed and Tracey, Andrea's daughter is just a baby. This sort of thing really bothers fans of a series. Unfortunately it's also not as well written as the other books.\n\n"", '\n\n  Christmas Cupcake Murder is a quick read.  Overall I did enjoy the book and it does have some fun moments. However it is not a murder mystery.  The mystery is not that complex and seems to be more in the background.  The characters spend more time talking and eating than really solving the mystery.  The other reason that I gave this book a 3 rating as it is set back a few years in the timeline and is a bit confusing as to where in fits with previous books.  I do like the characters.\n\n', '\n\n  If the book were a recipe I would guess that the baker left out the salt. To be blunt it was boring.

It didn\'t pick up where the previous book left off.  But Mike was still a jerk.\n\n', ""\n\n  This book went back to an earlier time with Hannah, but just doesn't fit the timeline.  Andrea isn't a real estate agent, Bill isn't the sheriff, Tracey is a baby, Delores doesn't have the antique store (nor is she an author) and she is just getting cosy with Doc, and Hannah's father's death was in the last several years.I expected a continuation of the series where it left off, not a recipe book with a weak storyline.\n\n"", ""\n\n  This book was so boring I struggled finishing it. I can't believe it was written by the same author. I've loved every other book. So disappointed.\n\n"", '\n\n  I always enjoy any book to do with Hannah . I often give the recipes a try and enjoy them. It felt weird to go back in time but a filling in was good.\n\n', '\n\n  Quick and easy read with all the usual characters.  Not a lot of time spent on the plot, but it is cozy and familiar.\n\n', '\n\n  Great Read.  Came in great time and in good condition.  Thanks  J\n\n']"

  You can thrive in crisis!  For behold, darkness shall cover the earth,       and thick darkness the peoples;   but the Lord will arise upon you,   and his glory will be seen upon you.
