  #1 on AMAZON, and a NEW YORK TIMES, WALL STREET JOURNAL, USA TODAY and PUBLISHERS WEEKLY NATIONAL BESTSELLERPharma-funded mainstream media has convinced millions of Americans that Dr. Anthony Fauci is a hero. He is anything but.   As director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), Dr. Anthony Fauci dispenses $6.1 billion in annual taxpayer-provided funding for scientific research, allowing him to dictate the subject, content, and outcome of scientific health research across the globe. Fauci uses the financial clout at his disposal to wield extraordinary influence over hospitals, universities, journals, and thousands of influential doctors and scientists—whose careers and institutions he has the power to ruin, advance, or reward.   During more than a year of painstaking and meticulous research, Robert F. Kennedy Jr. unearthed a shocking story that obliterates media spin on Dr. Fauci . . . and that will alarm every American—Democrat or Republican—who cares about democracy, our Constitution, and the future of our children’s health.  The Real Anthony Fauci reveals how “America’s Doctor” launched his career during the early AIDS crisis by partnering with pharmaceutical companies to sabotage safe and effective off-patent therapeutic treatments for AIDS. Fauci orchestrated fraudulent studies, and then pressured US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) regulators into approving a deadly chemotherapy treatment he had good reason to know was worthless against AIDS. Fauci repeatedly violated federal laws to allow his Pharma partners to use impoverished and dark-skinned children as lab rats in deadly experiments with toxic AIDS and cancer chemotherapies.   In early 2000, Fauci shook hands with Bill Gates in the library of Gates’ $147 million Seattle mansion, cementing a partnership that would aim to control an increasingly profitable $60 billion global vaccine enterprise with unlimited growth potential. Through funding leverage and carefully cultivated personal relationships with heads of state and leading media and social media institutions, the Pharma-Fauci-Gates alliance exercises dominion over global health policy.  The Real Anthony Fauci details how Fauci, Gates, and their cohorts use their control of media outlets, scientific journals, key government and quasi-governmental agencies, global intelligence agencies, and influential scientists and physicians to flood the public with fearful propaganda about COVID-19 virulence and pathogenesis, and to muzzle debate and ruthlessly censor dissent.     Read more  ","['5.0 out of 5 stars', '5.0 out of 5 stars', '5.0 out of 5 stars', '5.0 out of 5 stars', '5.0 out of 5 stars', '5.0 out of 5 stars', '5.0 out of 5 stars', '1.0 out of 5 stars']","['\nFauci Earthquake\n', '\nExcellent Book - everyone should read..\n', '\nTruth\n', '\nHonest and trustworthy journalism\n', '\nGet this book by any means necessary\n', '\nMeaning is found in context!\n', '\nNo matter your current covid opinions, read this book\n', '\nLies.

One of those girls was the adorable 4 year old Winnie who was scared of the monsters under her bed. Fast forward a few months and here I am reading about Frannie, who is now in her 40’s, Mac who is now in his 50’s, and cute 4-year-old-Winnie, who is now 22 years old and getting diddled by her next door neighbour…. and that, right there, is why I don’t like next generation books!Aside from that, this story was super cute! There were quite a lot of similarities between this book and Irresistible, but since I loved that book, I loved this one too.

I try to take notes about books to remember my favourite part and ""Bellamy Creek"" is all I wrote down because I loved that part SO MUCH and I was just absolutely blasting through the rest of the book. BACK TO THE POINT, Winnie is amazing and I love how much we get to learn about Winnie and her goals and her dreams and her past and ugh, any man who ever treated Winnie wrong (I\'m looking at you Merrick!), if I catch you in the STREETS. BEWARE.Dex is, holy. I don\'t even know where to start with Dex. My obsession with Dex is almost so much that I can\'t even talk about it.

So many characters were so well-developed...Nina, Ian, Jordan...I'm not sure who I liked the best, though I got a huge kick out of Nina, who was such a study in contrasts: hilarious one moment and utterly terrifying in the next. The woman at the centre of the mystery was quite skillfully layered as well.This book was haunting and heartbreaking but it also had lovely moments of tenderness and playfulness. I loved the real history that was woven into the fiction, and I know that this story will stay with me for years to come.\n\n"", ""\n\n  A good story of Soviet female pilots, the Night Witches, Nazi war criminals and those that hunted them down and brought them to justice and a family not recognizing the danger amongst them.Kate Quinn wrote one of my favorite books, The Alice Network.  I loved that book.  The Huntress is an interesting story but didn't capture my heart the way that one did.\n\n"", '\n\n  The Huntress /  Die JagerinThis book captures your attention immediately at the beginning. The Huntress character Lorelei Vogt,  is based on two real people who embodied such evil. The set up of the book of the main characters is educational and interesting. It embodies women pilots in Russia during WW2 called the Night Witches. The stories of their lives, their flying expeditions over the German Lines is informative and interesting. The way the author connects a Russian female pilot to a British escaped Prisoner of war and their escape through Poland captures the reader to want to know the outcome. Fast forward to the Nuremberg trials and 2 men looking for a woman they call the Huntress. Their trips around Western Europe, then across to USA, the difficulties they had, the people they met who The Huntress had influenced and killed. The chase and the people she wouldn’t hesitate to kill was frightening. She went to great lengths to save herself.The team of four people whose lives had been affected by The Huntress wanted to obtain justice, and they did through a lot of hard work. I highly recommend this book definitely will give it 5+stars. This book had my heart throughout, couldn’t put it down.\n\n', '\n\n  Great read. You can never read too many books about the Holocaust because we must never forget!!  This book is another great one!  It is simple in its structure and therefore accessible to every level of reader.  The character of Nina and the historical facts make this book amazing. Highly recommend!  It is also a good Holocaust literature book for a younger reader (teens 14-18) too because it is accurate but also not as gruesome in every detail as some others.  It would be good for a high school class actually. It has gay themes too, which is important for younger readers.  I loved this book. However, if you are a racist, sexist or homophobic, this is not the book for you....or is it? ;)\n\n', ""\n\n  I could hardly put this book down!  The characters were vibrant and so real.  The story was a different angle on WW2 than I'm accustomed to and it was fascinating.  Every bit of this book was enthralling.  The author certainly knew what she was doing when she wove this particular tale together.\n\n"", ""\n\n  This was a real page turner.  I liked the format.  The chapters alternate between the three chief characters.  The chapters are short which makes for easier reading.  The chapters on Nina and her flying excursions are so real that one thinks they're with her.  One learns early on who the huntress is which adds to thrill of the chase.  Highly recommend.\n\n"", '\n\n  This is a riveting story of the search to bring a diabolical female Nazi war criminal to justice. The story is fascinating, and the characters are complex and intriguing. Without a doubt, this was one of my favourite reads in 2019. I highly recommend it to historical fiction fans and to those with an interest in the quest to capture Nazi war criminals.\n\n', ""\n\n  I'm in the middle of this fascinating book and can hardly put it down to get anything else done. Kate Quinn has done it again!\n\n""]"
