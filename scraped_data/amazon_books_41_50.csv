To be so broken and finding still the strength within yourself to go on fighting for what you believe in and love with the help of her new friends. It is a slow burn romance which is believable and feels natural as well as healing !The love interests as our Heroine refers to her Four Alpha Wolves, they are each very different, but very protective and caring and gorgeous in their own unique ways …I found myself drawn to all four of them through our heroines eyes as well..This first book has great world building, really good strong character development and the progression of the friendships and relationships our Heroine forms is actually believable for a paranormal Wolf Shifter RomanceI am really excited to read the entire series as it becomes available 🐺💜🐺💜🐺💜🐺💜Yes, it would be great if we would not have to wait between books, but it makes it also very much fun to have to wait….I definitely recommend this series if you love 🐺 Wolves Reverse Harem Wolf Shifter RomanceThank you kindly,Stay Safe Healthy Happy 😊\n\n', '\n\n  Just wow!

  A court reporter for the Nuremberg war crimes trial of Nazi doctors reveals the shocking truth of their torture and murder in this monumental memoir.Vivien Spitz reported on the Nuremberg trials for the U.S. War Department from 1946 to 1948. In Doctors from Hell, she vividly describes her experiences both in and out of the courtroom. A chilling story of human depravity and ultimate justice, this important memoir includes trial transcripts as well as photographs used as evidence.The author describes the experience of being in bombed-out, dangerous, post-war Nuremberg. She recounts dramatic courtroom testimony and the reactions of the defendants to the proceedings. Witnesses tell of experiments in which they were deprived of oxygen; frozen; injected with malaria, typhus, and jaundice; subjected to the amputation of healthy limbs; forced to drink seawater for weeks at a time; and other horrors.Doctors from Hell is a significant addition to the literature on World War II and the Holocaust, medical ethics, human rights, and the barbaric depths to which human beings can descend.“In this personal account of her service in the Nuremberg War Crimes Trials, Vivien Spitz continues to contribute to the cause of human rights.” —President James Carter  Read more  ","['5.0 out of 5 stars', '5.0 out of 5 stars', '2.0 out of 5 stars', '4.0 out of 5 stars', '5.0 out of 5 stars', '1.0 out of 5 stars', '4.0 out of 5 stars', '4.0 out of 5 stars']","['\nRecommended\n', '\nA distressing part of history.\n', '\nDoctors from Hell\n', '\nThis was a tough read and it had nothing to ...\n', '\nGreat read\n', '\nExaggerated\n', '\nFour Stars\n', '\nFour Stars\n']","[""\n\n  The book is very well written and vividly depicts the horrors of human experimentation during the Holocaust.

Everyone has a secret plan that they execute flawlessly.Liv's idea of wealth is name dropping expensive brands every couple of pages. There aren't any characters other than manipulator and patsy. The ending is trite. The sex reads like an editor (wisely) cut out the longer, more graphic sections. The antagonist is cartoonishly evil with no redeeming qualities.Look, it's bad. Really bad.

Amber is a devious young woman of suspicious and uncertain background. She is manipulative and insinuates herself into the lives of a very wealthy married couple. She envies their closeness,their home and possessions and plans to have their lifestyle for herself. The wife is Daphne, a beautiful and compassionate philanthropist. She lives in a lavish mansion with designer clothing and jewellery as gifts from her husband and seems to have unlimited funds to spend on herself. Daphne is the mother of two young girls. Her husband, Jackson, is an immensely wealthy and handsome real estate mogul. Amber schemes to have their wealth and life.  The first part of the book describes how Amber obtains Daphne’s sympathy, bonds with her over lies and quickly becomes her best friend and confidante. All the time she plans to take her husband and mansion by undermining her. With the help of Daphne she lands a job in Jackson’s office. Daphne seems naive and easily persuaded to fall for Amber’s schemes.  Then the book tells the story from Daphne’s perspective. We find she has some dark, miserable secrets of her own that she keeps from her friends and her estranged mother. Some frequent graphic sex scenes, mostly necessary for the plot, which prevented me from giving it 5 stars. The characterizations were very believable, but hope people like that are few and far between.\n\n', ""\n\n  The first third of this novel was ho hum. It wasn't bad enough to put down but it wasn't overly gripping either. Then after that it was unputdownable.  There wasn't a shocking ending or anything like that.

  Alvin and his wives had been busy over the last few weeks. They’d gone out of their way to visit settlements they’d helped in the past, all while killing a string of mini-bosses across what had been the American west. Life looked good for Team Asshole… until the devs made a mistake.Without any warning, Sammi stopped showing up. At first, they brushed it off as her being too busy, or maybe in trouble. That changed when a new dev showed up and tried to assert his dominance. That man was killed twice— first by Alvin blowing his head off his shoulders, then by Mousie running him through with both of her swords.With the gloves off, Team Asshole started breaking things they’d left alone. They circumvented rules left and right, cheated fast travel, and did everything else they could. A third dev appeared and pleaded for a chance to explain.Sammi hadn’t been fired, they were told. Instead, there was an unexpected development— Sammi was the first alpha tester. Now that they knew their friend was fine— and might even join them soon— Alvin and his wives backed off their shenanigans to give the new dev, Renato, a chance. It wasn’t long after that that they received a message from Sammi. She was in New Orleans, stuck in the Superdome with a Loa named Erzulie, and she needed their help. With no hesitation, they loaded up their helicopter, Sky Blade, and set off to rescue Sammi and those with her.After barely pulling off the rescue of Sammi and half a dozen other women, Team Asshole returned to their base. In the aftermath, Sammi joined Team Asshole fully, accepted as another wife by Alvin and with Gothy’s enthusiastic approval.

Joe Dillard is an appealing protagonist - a bright, brave, decent, yet very human man. He's someone most of us can relate to.

  Jack and I, we did everything backward. The day he lured me into his office-which was also the first day we met-he proposed. You'd think a guy who looked like him-a bit cold maybe, but still striking and very unattainable-would only ask the love of his life to marry him, right? You'd think he must be madly in love.Nope. It was me he asked. A complete stranger who had never even heard of him. A stranger who had been dumped by her fiancé only weeks before. You'd think I'd laugh in his face, call him insane-and a few other names-then walk away as quickly as possible. Well…I did all those things except the walking away part.It took him only minutes to talk me into a business deal…erm, I mean marriage, and only days for us to officially tie the knot. Happiest day of my life. Magical. Pop the champagne… Not. It was the worst day. Jack Hawthorne was nothing like what I'd imagined for myself.I blamed him for my lapse in judgment. I blamed his eyes, the ocean blue eyes that looked straight into mine unapologetically, and that frown on his face I had no idea I would become so fascinated with in time.It wasn't long after he said I was the biggest mistake of his life that things started to change. No, he still didn't talk much, but anyone can string a few words together. His actions spoke the loudest to me. And day after day my heart started to get a mind of its own.One second he was no one. The next he became everything.One second he was unattainable. The next he seemed to be completely mine.One second I thought we were in love. The next it was still nothing but a lie.After all, I was Rose and he was Jack. We were doomed from the very beginning with those names. Did you expect anything else?

Kinch Na Shannack owes the Takers Guild a small fortune for his education as a thief, which includes (but is not limited to) lock-picking, knife-fighting, wall-scaling, fall-breaking, lie-weaving, trap-making, plus a few small magics. His debt has driven him to lie in wait by the old forest road, planning to rob the next traveler that crosses his path.But today, Kinch Na Shannack has picked the wrong mark.Galva is a knight, a survivor of the brutal goblin wars, and handmaiden of the goddess of death. She is searching for her queen, missing since a distant northern city fell to giants.Unsuccessful in his robbery and lucky to escape with his life, Kinch now finds his fate entangled with Galva's. Common enemies and uncommon dangers force thief and knight on an epic journey where goblins hunger for human flesh, krakens hunt in dark waters, and honor is a luxury few can afford.“The Blacktongue Thief is fast and fun and filled with crazy magic.

You do have to work a little to absorb it in parts. There is a lot of made up slang and cultural stuff and references to past history in the countries of the story that you somewhat have to figure out as you go, but in a way that pulled me into it more.The main character has a great world weary cynicism and is always ready with a joke. The author convincingly makes him a character to empathize with.

  JackThe sooner I get out of Eden, Pennsylvania, the better. It’s like Christmas exploded here in the small town, way too merry for me.

  ""What do you mean you have a fake fiancé?""Running into an old enemy can really do strange things to you. And when you find out said enemy is engaged to your father . . . well, let's just say the best of choices were not made. It was supposed to be a vacation of a lifetime before the school year started back up again. My best friend was getting married and I had a free trip to Hawaii. But that first night, I ran into not only my estranged dad, but his newly betrothed as well. Immediately my defenses were raised and before I knew it, I was telling them all about my beautifully handsome and extremely muscular fiancé who was on vacation with me. Which meant, I needed a man and quick. Unfortunately, Hawaii is a very small group of islands and my options of single men were limited. I was left with one choice, Brock ""Romeo"" Romero. He's handsome. He's muscular. And he's single. He checked all the boxes. So what's the problem? Unfortunately, we completely and utterly despise each other.  Note from author: This book is a smattering of tropes: Enemies to lovers, turned friends to lovers, and also coworkers to lovers. Not to mention, a fake fiancé romance that takes place in Maui and Chicago. Lots of heat--a balcony scene that will make you blush--absurdly funny pranks, best supporting cast, a surprise ""mom"" you'll never see coming, and a grumbly gus of a hero who can't stop pining after his girl.

The two of them have known and worked together for the last few years. Brock has had a crush on Stella for years and finally worked up the courage to ask her on a date. The only issue was that Stella had no idea it was a date and ended up going home with someone else at the end of the night. From that point on, Brock has been cold and distant towards Stella even though they used to be best friends. Fast forward to their friend and co-workers wedding at a resort in Hawaii. Once night, drunk Stella runs into her dad who she finds out is not only staying at the same resort but he’s engaged to her high school nemesis. Stella drunkenly confesses that she’s also engaged to Brock. The two of them engage in a fake fiancé charade for the duration of the wedding.This was hands down one of the funniest books that I’ve ever read. I know that this trope has been done over and over again but somehow Meghan knows how to put a new spin on things. The biggest issue with Stella and Brock is that they never knew when to communicate with one another. They just let things fester and they would both shut down. There are possibly too many good moments in this book to mention; however, the balcony scene and the way that Keiko describes it had me crying I was laughing so hard. There pool scene with Brock and Stella was one of the steamiest make out scenes I’ve ever read. This is a wonderful book that will have you laughing, crying and swooning.\n\n', '\n\n  The laughs are all there, just like in See Me After Class (read it first, it will make the reading experience here that much richer when you connect the dots). Stella and Romeo appear in that book and you will have such a deeper appreciation of where they start in this story if you read that one first. Plus, Greer & Arlo\'s wedding is the setting for most of this story, so go and find out how they got to this point.There is epic pranking that hits in just the right way (""man issue"" makes me snort giggle and I hope it keeps coming back), amazing drunken conversations with a kick-ass girl gang (I\'m just going to say ""Fireball"") and situations where you just have to ask yourself ""how did they get here?"" (hotel balcony sex anyone?).There is also so much heart you want to scream at the characters when they are being dense, cry with them in the lows and then cheer them on when they have the lightbulb moment before going out to make the grand gesture. And I have to say, as gestures go, this one hit me in all the feels.Sometimes I want to cuddle the characters in blankets and hide them from Meghan so she won\'t be bale to torture them any more, but then they wouldn\'t get the beautiful rainbow of a happy ending on the other end. So I will say, torture away my friend. Rip my heart out with theirs and then sew us back together better than we were before.We also get some seeds planted for the next book in the series. I can\'t wait to go to school again when the next one drops. This series is ripe for re-reads because it\'s just that damn good.The Audiobook was performed superbly by the epically talented Erin Mallon & Sebastian York. Erin Mallon\'s drunken girl talk is so well performed. She takes all the emotional levels and makes me feel them. SebYo is great as Romeo, from the not-so contained humour of his buddies when he\'s freaking out over his ""man issue"" to the gut wrenching broken hearted drunken Brock. His voice just slides down my spine and sweeps me away.\n\n', '\n\n  I was excited to read about Brock and Stella since they met in the previous book in this series. Brock has had feelings for Stella for years but has just masked it as being friendship. The one day he has courage to ask her out and she does not realize it is a date and ends up going home with that person.Things become tense between them but they are forced to have be together because of Greer and Arlo\'s wedding. A suprise guess brings Stella and Brock together making her ask him to be her fake ""fiance"" as they spend more time together will they find out if they are better together?This book had humor, heat, a swoony male lead yes I have claimed Brock he is mine! Meghan does it again and I cannot wait to read the next book she will release!\n\n', '\n\n  Romeo and Stella had great chemistry. I loved their easy and natural camaraderie when they were not awkwardly trying to avoid each other. My heart went out to Romeo. He knew exact what he wanted but the object of his affection was clueless to his feelings. It was frustrating to see his multiple failed attempts to make his moves.I loved the closeness and familiarity of the great group of friends. The pranks, teasing and antics were hilarious. I burst out laughing so hard at multiple occasions in the book. It was so much funny vacationing with them in Hawaii. Overall, I truly enjoyed this funny fake relationship, enemies-to-lovers rom-com and would highly recommend it to anyone who wants something funny, hot and heartfelt.\n\n']"

However, I don't always enjoy their joint books as much. I think this is because they have very different writing styles (I lean more towards Ella Frank, all her books are 5-star reads to me), so when they come together to write a book, it seems like their styles clash a bit.Ryder came across as a bargain-bin Logan (from Ella's Temptation series), and pushed that boundary between persistent and inappropriate (and not in a taboo way, but a bit of an annoying way) too many times. It was a bit too much back and forth, which I think was supposed to build up the tension, but it didn't quite work out that way for me. The characters were a little flat.That said, it intrigued me enough to read the entire book. This is NOT a badly written book at all, and both these authors are amazing in their own right. I've read almost all of their work and Ella is a 1-Click author for me.However, this will not deter me from reading their individual works, or their joint ventures, as they are both amazing. It was singularly this book that didn't work for me, and that's okay.Would still recommend ⭐⭐⭐The writing is still well done in it's own way, and I did want to see if they got their HEA, but did occasionally find myself skimming a bit.\n\n"", ""\n\n  𝘙𝘺𝘥𝘦𝘳 𝘸𝘢𝘴 𝘨𝘰𝘪𝘯𝘨 𝘵𝘰 𝘣𝘦 𝘯𝘰𝘵𝘩𝘪𝘯𝘨 𝘣𝘶𝘵 𝘵𝘳𝘰𝘶𝘣𝘭𝘦, 𝘣𝘶𝘵 𝘴𝘶𝘥𝘥𝘦𝘯𝘭𝘺 𝘵𝘳𝘰𝘶𝘣𝘭𝘦 𝘩𝘢𝘥 𝘯𝘦𝘷𝘦𝘳 𝘭𝘰𝘰𝘬𝘦𝘥 𝘴𝘰 𝘨𝘰𝘰𝘥.Book...

Surely what their meddlesome fathers insisted must have been true-that he was a reckless seducer determined to destroy her innocence. . . and she was a shameless fortune hunter.

But how could he ever again trust the raven-haired deceiver who had shattered his soul? And Victoria could never give her heart a second time to the cad who so callously trampled on it the first.

But when their fathers prevent them from eloping-and each thinks the other has betrayed him/her, they are both plunged into seven years of a bitter broken heart. Victoria runs away from home and goes to work for the amazingly cruel and insulting Lady Hollingwood, as a governess to her impossibly bratty son Neville. It's been seven years since she's seen Robert, but she's been unable to forget him. When he shows up at a weekend house part Lady Hollingwood throws, Victoria is speechless. Robert is furious: here she is in front of him-the woman who wanted him only for his money and title and whom he still burns for. He's spent seven years in other women's arms trying unsuccessfully to extricate Victoria from his heart. Now he vows to seduce and abandon her to get his revenge. But as Robert forces his attentions onto a hesitant yet attracted Victoria, he soon realizes that he can never let her go. He won't marry her but he'll bind her to him forever. When he asks her to be his mistress instead of his wife, Victoria's heart is broken a second time, and all she can think of is escaping from the man she will never be able to banish from her heart. This novel has a touching beginning-the courtship between Victoria and Robert is beautiful and refreshing. However, the subsequent rift between them is frankly implausible: there is no way the reader can believe that Robert would assume the worst when Victoria fails to show up for their elopement, even after he spies her asleep in her bed. He has no way to know her reasons, and to abandon her without finding them out reflects very badly on him. Even when the reader gets over this, Victoria then seems incredible when she is for awhile irritatingly prudish and churlish. Yet despite this and despite the failure to fully develop Victoria and Robert's characters, Everything and the Moon is often fun and touching. It is especially delightful when Robert kidnaps Victoria and takes her to a deserted cottage on the coast where they must somehow work out their differences. The dialogue and overall sensibility is not as humorous as Quinn's earlier trilogy, but this is still overall an entertaining novel.\n\n"", '\n\n  Let me preface this review by saying that I really like Julia Quinn. She is, in fact, one of my favorite romance authors ever. I discovered her with ""The Duke and I,"" I devour each of the Bridgerton books as they come out, and now I\'ve gone looking for her earlier books to tide me over until the next installment.Unfortunately, ""Everything and the Moon"" is not one of her best works. It\'s not *bad*, by any means, but there\'s nothing particualarly memorable about it either. The plot doesn\'t flow very well -- each segment seems a little disjointed from the one that came before -- and it could have borrowed from any of a thousand other romance novels. The characters don\'t really stand out either; they\'re fairly generic, as if they were sent from Central Casting and not fleshed out at all. I\'ve just finished the book, and I have a feeling that in a few days, I won\'t remember much about it at all.Despite this middle-of-the-road quality, it does have its good points; I occasionally saw flashes of Ms. Quinn\'s trademark wit and style. Robert\'s reaction when he almost walked in on Victoria in the bath amused me to no end, and the way Victoria trounces the villain at the end of the book made me both laugh and cheer. But, on the whole, this book was rather flat.This is one of Ms. Quinn\'s earlier efforts, and it shows -- she has greatly improved as writer since then, in my opinion. If you\'re just looking for a regency romance to read, there\'s nothing actually *wrong* with this book; there\'s just nothing really exciting about it. If you\'re looking for early Julia Quinn, I recommend reading ""To Catch an Heiress"" instead; it\'s much more lively and charming. If you\'ve never read anything by Julia Quinn before, I recommend picking up a copy of ""The Duke and I,"" the first volume of the Bridgerton series -- you\'ll be letting yourself in for a real treat!\n\n']"

I was so happy and excited when I got it in the wee hours of the morning of May 2nd but I got scared that it took me a day to muster my courage to finally read it (after waiting for a year, hello!). My review might have tiny bits of spoilers (but no major details), so do not proceed in reading this if you don\'t want to know any events in the book.So... Let\'s talk about the beginning, with where the second book ended. If you remember there was so much hatred there for Tamlin, and Feyre was determined to bring the whole Spring Court down. That was a major cliff-hanger as it was so intense and very promising. We waited for a year to find out how she\'s going to handle the situation there alone. However, it was just disappointing for me that I found that certain period to be really short and I wish the time she spent there was a bit longer - that there were more deceiving events. But of course, the story needed to move on at some point.I must say that Feyre\'s strength, maturity and loyalty were really evident in all the efforts she exerted to form certain alliances even with other characters that I really didn\'t see coming, (view spoiler) and all the adventures that she went into together with Rhysand and the rest of their family. I admire her that she was able to hold her own and prove to the others that she is worthy of being called a High Lady - it\'s just so majestic, especially when she claims and says it out loud!On another note, I found her and Rhysand annoying though at some point. It was whenever they kept on saying that everything is always Feyre\'s choice. I got that message already in ACOMAF, and another mention of it in this book wouldn\'t have hurt. But I didn\'t expect it to be repeated over and over here. Also, the intimate scenes between those two... they\'re a bit disappointing. They were lacking in so many ways and I don\'t know if it was because of the safe words used by the author, the lackluster description, or the fact that it had already been established by SJM in Q&As that Feyre and Rhysand will remain as mates - so it wasn\'t as interesting anymore as it used to be in the second book. It could be because in ACOMAF, there was that mystery, tension and longing between them. But now, they\'re just always cheesy and lovey-dovey. Those scenes could\'ve been upped to be sexy and steamy since this is actually NOT a children\'s book (let\'s not forget that this series is wrongly categorized since the beginning under children\'s/teens\' which is mortifying)!There were also other events in the book that just kept me asking for more. Most of the supposed-to-be important events had me on my toes and kept me reading for hours with no food and water. The suspense in each event were greatly amplified but sometimes they just leave me shaking my head because of the half baked story telling. It made me then think that they were just snippets forced to be included in the story to at least have something to look forward to or be fearful of. Don\'t get me wrong, they were indeed essential in the flow of the story but how SJM made the characters deal with the problems and the actions they took to solve them could\'ve been prolonged and more detailed.As for the other characters, I ADORE THEM! With Nesta, that much I have expected and never changed - she\'s still as feisty as she can be. And her with Cassian, it hasn\'t really been established but I\'m hoping you guys have already read the short story about those two right after ACOMAF was released last year. There\'s indeed tension and passion between them and I think it will just be a matter of time before the mating bond (I\'m hoping, I\'m really hoping that it exists!!!) snaps into place. With Lucien, there was a bit more of him here as compared to the second book. He showed how courageous he is (view spoiler) but I\'m craving for him more in action! And of course, Rhysand. He was such a great support to Feyre and he really showed how selfless he is in this book. Aside from doing his best to unite everyone, he really gave his all to protect everyone and to achieve that goal of creating a new world - another dream of his. As for the new characters (and old ones with their revelations)whom I will not mention so I don\'t really spoil anything, love the diversity! From the appearance, the secrets, up to their own personal selves - I am so happy that these were included in the story! Inclusion, that is the main theme of this story. Everyone is struggling with their own issues, and it\'s not bad to be different. You\'ll see in this book that some of the characters would just want to be themselves and be free of all the judgements from other people. They had to struggle to exist in their own right (be it Fae, human, or whatever creature), to hide the truth they had to hurt people around them, not to mention also their own selves. So it\'s not just about what kind of creature you are, but it\'s also about who you really are and how it is important to be able to be included and accepted in society openly - a world open to diversity and inclusion.And now let\'s talk about Tamlin. I still have a soft spot for him and I can understand why he became such a pain to everyone. Hey, he was fooled! Let\'s not forget, Feyre showed understanding, kindness and love not just to him but also to his people in the very beginning of this series. And because of that, he was able to love and become happy again after a long time. But she tricked him! So imagine everything he went through from the very start, all the guilt inside him building up as time went by, all his efforts trying to make up for the mistakes he made cast aside and he ended up in a pit again - but it\'s deeper this time. As I\'ve mentioned in my ACOMAF review, Tamlin was already broken to begin with, even before meeting Feyre. And it just became worse as he was fooled and played with by everyone around him! He had high hopes, he really did. Unfortunately, they all just broke him even more into tiny little pieces. He was left with no one to turn to. So I can just imagine the kind of darkness he was in. Love can be really cruel as it made him choose the wrong decisions left and right. Let\'s give him some credit because he did try to redeem himself by making up for everything he had done in the past to keep Feyre happy and safe. And I still admire him. He\'s a dreamer and I too hope he finds happiness. Oh, how I cried harder with what he did...So after all those surprises left and right - all the lies, betrayals, scandals, bargains, allegiance, loyalty, revelations, sacrifices, and promises, I think A Court of Wings and Ruin deserves 4 stars from me even though I was actually expecting a different ending (view spoiler). Even with all the ""girl power"" (how lame I might\'ve worded it to be), in the end Sarah J. Maas showed that in this war, it\'s not just the High Lords who have vital roles. There was also emphasis on those who are different, evidently those who were ""Made"" to push for harmony between humans, faes and other creatures. The message that it is indeed possible to build that kind of world, only if the majority is willing to fight for it.And that concludes my LONGEST book review ever! There were just so much to say that I have to mention some specific details in the book to make my point. And if you\'re curious, I also cried in this book because of certain events - especially at the end, like my feelings were toyed with by the author. My full review with spoilers can be found on my Goodreads account, but I\'m not sure if I\'m allowed to post the link here. So it\'s up to you to be able to find me there! ;)\n\n', ""\n\n  All I can say is that you should definitely read this book. I loved it so much! I could not put it down. Love, drama, bargains, magic, power and war makes it great reading. Thought the end was a little bit rushed but that's probably cos I didn't want it to end. Thanks for writing such a great book, Sarah! Tempted to reread them all straight away!!\n\n"", '\n\n  I love this series. It captured me immediately and every time I read it, I burn through the series so fast because I become so involved with the characters I simply cannot put it down.I want more of them and their stories, past book 4. I could read about their adventures forever. This is one of the few series that is always on my “must re-read list”.\n\n', ""\n\n  Yet again Sarah Maas lured me into her world and I didn't want to leave.  This third book in the Court series did not disappoint and in fact, each book in the series improves and impresses. There were so many things happening in this book to continue the story from book 2. The best part of this book was that I didn't want to finish this book and leave behind Rhys and company. I don't feel I can say much about the actual plot  without spoiling key points because there were several shocking and jaw dropping moments. I love the roles of Elaine and Nessa and how they became incorporated into Feyre's new world. Maas does an excellent job of mixing basic character development and big epic life changing stories all together.\n\n"", '\n\n  Feyre, newly made Lady of the Night Court and bonded to Rhysand, has pretended the return of her memory and returned to Spring with Tamlin and Lucien, preparing to meet with Ianthe and the Hybern royals to determine the method and place of attacking the human realm on the other side of The Wall.  After a battle with the royals Feyre and Lucien make a tortured escape to the Night Court in order to try to gather support among the Courts and other possible allies to face the upcoming battle for Prythian.  Hybern has decided to remove the wall between the Fae and humans and the Courts must decide to either support and protect the humans or join Hybern in the slaughter.  As the various Courts make their decisions Feyre and her sisters, Nesta and Elain, changed to Fae by the Cauldron, must use their powers to support the Courts protecting the humans leading to a war between the Courts either for or against the plans of Hybern.  This is an excellent continuation (apparently not a conclusion) to the sage of Feyre.\n\n', ""\n\n  This was a good book - but still does not compare to ACOMAF. I was left needing more ... from the various different characters story lines. I know she has other storys from this world coming up ... but I felt that ACOWAR just left me unsatisfied because of all the lose ends still not tied up. Also I thought the ending was a little ... repetitive. I mean don't get me wrong, I'm glad it ended how it did .. but it felt rushed.Overall it's still a must read. And there were MANY favorite moments ... but I just think it was a good book to tide us over until we get to the good stuff with the other series :)\n\n"", '\n\n  I was really excited to get this book!.

  Revised and updated: the definitive primary-source history of US involvement in General Pinochet’s Chilean coup—“the evidence is overwhelming” (The New Yorker).    Published to commemorate the fortieth anniversary of General Augusto Pinochet’s infamous September 11, 1973, military coup in Chile, this updated edition of The Pinochet File reveals the shocking, formerly secret record of the US government’s complicity with atrocity in a foreign country. The book now completes the file on Pinochet’s story, detailing his multiple indictments between 2004 and his death on December 10, 2006, including the Riggs Bank scandal that revealed how the dictator had illegally squirreled away over $26 million in ill-begotten wealth in secret American bank accounts.   When it was first released in hardcover, The Pinochet File contributed to the international campaign to hold Pinochet accountable for murder, torture, and terrorism. A new afterword tells the extraordinary story of Henry Kissinger’s attempt to undercut the book’s reception—efforts that generated a major scandal that led to a high-level resignation at the Council on Foreign Relations, illustrating the continued ability of the book to speak truth to power.   “The Pinochet File should be considered the long awaited book of record on U.S. intervention in Chile . . . A crisp compelling narrative, almost a political thriller.” —Los Angeles Times  Read more  ","['5.0 out of 5 stars', '5.0 out of 5 stars', '3.0 out of 5 stars', '4.0 out of 5 stars', '5.0 out of 5 stars']","['\nChilean genocide!\n', '\nVery important book, specially for americans\n', '\na testimony\n', '\nImportant record of State Terrorism\n', '\nFive Stars\n']","[""\n\n  I can't believe this happened and in my lifetime too!

  The mega-bestseller with more than 2 million readers, soon to be a major television seriesFrom the #1 New York Times-bestselling author of The Lincoln Highway and Rules of Civility, a beautifully transporting novel about a man who is ordered to spend the rest of his life inside a luxury hotel In 1922, Count Alexander Rostov is deemed an unrepentant aristocrat by a Bolshevik tribunal, and is sentenced to house arrest in the Metropol, a grand hotel across the street from the Kremlin. Rostov, an indomitable man of erudition and wit, has never worked a day in his life, and must now live in an attic room while some of the most tumultuous decades in Russian history are unfolding outside the hotel’s doors. Unexpectedly, his reduced circumstances provide him entry into a much larger world of emotional discovery. Brimming with humor, a glittering cast of characters, and one beautifully rendered scene after another, this singular novel casts a spell as it relates the count’s endeavor to gain a deeper understanding of what it means to be a man of purpose.

Never boring, always thought provoking.\n', '\nBook Lover\n']","['\n\n  Count Alexander Rostov may be one of my favourite literary figures. An aristocrat in Tsarist Russia who never worked a day in his life, he is a recipient of the Order of Saint Andrew, member of the Jockey Club, and Master of the Hunt. Rostov was out of country when the communists took over. Following his return to Moscow, he is made a ""Former Person” by a committee that the Count delightfully skewers in the process.This kangaroo court gives way to a Kafkaesque ruling. The Count can stay in The Metropol Hotel but if he ever leaves the building, he will be killed. Then the novel is off-to-the-races as we follow Rostov’s several decades long ‘incarceration’. He takes it all extremely well, “if a man does not master his circumstances then he is bound to be mastered by them.”I read each page with joyful expectation as to how the Count would react and what erudite turn-of-phrase he would spout. The book is as charming and stylish as Rostov himself. He is never condescending, nor does he present as superior. He is a gentleman and that distinction is clear given the brutishness of the country’s new leaders.Any mention of the plot here would rob readers of what you must discover yourselves. This is a fantastic read of old-world charm, Cold War shenanigans, a life well-lived, and varying wonderful notions of family and purpose.Instead of plot, let me share three snippets of wonderful prose:“Fate would not have the reputation it has, if it simply did what it seemed it would do.”“History is the business of identifying momentous events from the comfort of a high-back chair.”“Life is every bit as devious as Death. It too can wear a hooded coat. It too can slip into town, lurk in an alley, or wait in the back of a tavern.”\n\n', ""\n\n  How to confront oppression of the soul? With dignity, good grace and yes, civility. Count Rostov prevails, despite the restrictions imposed on him, condemned to live out his life in the confines of Moscow's Hotel Metropol.This charming, fanciful and lighthearted novel focuses on the best of human attributes. Sly comments justly level insightful and amusing barbs at the shortcomings of Stalin's regime and the ensuing soviet years.Although quite improbable it is an enjoyable read, just the sort of book that makes one smile before putting it aside and turning out the lights.\n\n"", '\n\n  An excellent read. Against a historical background in Russia, we follow the life, loves, trials and tribulations of Count Rostov who was banished to a tiny lodging under the roof of a large hotel.The story evolves logically and is interspersed  with philosophical musings. It is well written in a gentle style and keeps you reading on. No gore, but excellent descriptions of difficult events.\n\n', ""\n\n  Although A Gentleman in Moscow is well written and has at times a modicum of charm, I found it, on the whole,  pretentious and full of meaningless meanderings  I kept hoping that the plot would lead to somewhere but the book rambled on from chapter to chapter.  I was not able to establish a connection with the main character.  I couldn't have cared less if he lived or suicided himself.  I seldom leave a book unfinished but I didn't have the patience to complete this one.\n\n"", '\n\n  An amazing book!  Took my time reading it because I wanted to savour ever bit.  The characters were so well drawn that you could see them and hear them speak, the settings were very clearly described and were easily visualized, and the story line moved along smoothly.  It takes place in Russia, beginning a few years after the Bolshevik Revolution but is not the dark and gloomy Russia found in Dostoyevsky or Tolstoy.  The ending left me smiling broadly, yet with a small question on my mind.  Cannot recommend this book enough.\n\n', '\n\n  In spite of the enormous changes brought about by his incarceration at this hotel the Count was always as the title suggests, a GentlemanHe creates a special place for himself, and arranged his days as though nothing had changed. His routine gave him comfort I believe but his ability to adapt and enjoy meeting challenges was amusing and amazing  I loved the different characters that came and went or stayed.  Altogether very engrossing.  A satisfying read and different.  Russia at that time seems so odd.  Arbitrary decisions by communist bureaucrats that make no sense but could change a life in a heartbeat\n\n', ""\n\n  I had put off reading this book for some time. How interesting could a story about a man stuck in a hotel really be?The answer is - it's excellent. It is just a wonderful story that combines style, humour, historical references, love, suspense, and even some philosophy into a wonderful read that is never boring. Read it even if you think you might not like it. You will.\n\n"", ""\n\n  I’m not fond of Russia/Russians to begin with.  I've read a bit of Russian literatures, the classics, but not for a long time.  This was typical of what I remembered....wordy, long, borderline boring...but I kept with it, and it did improve.  I did scan lots of paragraphs, though...  I think it could have been préci-ed with no loss of momentum.  I won’t be buying/reading/recommending another by him any time soon.\n\n""]"

But when we moved away and Colin’s band took off like a rocket, I knew my tweener fantasies would never become a reality.Fast-forward nine years to my brother’s wedding, when I saw Colin again and we shared a secret, drunken kiss that rocked my world.

I’m determined to make Colin swoon for me, the same way I’ve always done for him.

While she strives to adapt to Amish life, she bonds with the family, especially with two of the Yoder siblings: Jacob and Becca.Jacob, the eldest son, refuses to baptize and join the church, and according to his frustrated father, lacks direction.

  NEW YORK TIMES BESTSELLERThe highly anticipated new novel from one of our greatest living writers.It's December 23, 1971, and the Hildebrandt family is at a crossroads. The patriarch, Russ, the associate pastor of a suburban Chicago church, is poised to break free of a marriage he finds joyless--unless his brilliant and unstable wife, Marion, breaks free of it first. Their eldest child, Clem, is coming home from college afire with moral absolutism, having taken an action that will shatter his father. Clem's sister, Becky, long the social queen of her high-school class, has veered into the era's counterculture, while their younger brother Perry, fed up with selling pot to support his drug habit, has firmly resolved to be a better person. Each of the Hildebrandts seeks a freedom that each of the others threatens to complicate.Universally recognized as the leading novelist of his generation, Jonathan Franzen is often described as a teller of family stories. Only now, though, in Crossroads, has he given us a novel in which a family, in all the intricacy of its workings, is truly at the centre.By turns comic and harrowing, a tour-de-force of interwoven perspectives and sustained suspense, Crossroads is the first volume of a trilogy, A Key to All Mythologies, that will span three generations and trace the inner life of our culture through the present day. Complete in itself, set in a historical moment of moral crisis, and reaching back to the early twentieth century, Crossroads serves as a foundation for a sweeping investigation of human mythologies, as the Hildebrandt family navigates the political, intellectual and social crosscurrents of the past fifty years.Jonathan Franzen's gift for wedding depth and vividness of character with breadth of social vision has never been more dazzlingly evident than in Crossroads.

Kingmaker is a college for the mafia families of the world.  The students get a college education that is all about practicality for their futures.  Whether you are there as an Heir, an Accountant, a Spy or an Enforcer these are all important roles that the students of Kingmaker begin to grow into as the school year progresses.  This is Leo Gallo's story but it also tightly weaves in Anna Wilk and Dean Yenin as well as introduces a variety of other characters.

Sophie did a brilliant job of bringing this school to life through vivid descriptions of the settings, and the day-to-day experiences of the students along with the oh-so-realistic actions and reactions of being away from home for the first time as adults.

As if it isn’t bad enough that my entire hometown is buzzing with the news of my failed marriage, who is the first person I bump into at the grocery store? The guy who treated me like his personal booty call in high school just happens to be looking at spices while I’m trying to pick up cinnamon for my mother.And get this; Porter Kelly, the broody, mysterious recluse who exposed his own secrets to the world by writing a book about his family years ago, is the one who acts like I wronged him. His rude remarks on aisle nine are the final straw as my exhausted unhappiness breaks, and I’m officially calling off the most wonderful time of the year.Too bad it’s literally impossible for the woman whose parents own a railroad that specializes in Christmas train rides to ignore the holiday season. Because I’m back under their roof, it’s mandatory to work in the middle of the red and green merriment, Santa himself, and wait for it …Porter serenading us with the greatest festive hits of all time. That’s right, apparently my teenage heartthrob turned nemesis not only works for my parents, but can strum a guitar like he’s trying to get every soccer mom on board pregnant.

When reading this book, I never got the feeling that it was corny or predictable. I thought the characters shared a real past and along with it some deep seeded issues.Madison lived somewhat of a sheltered life. Her first real experience in a relationship was with someone who wasn't emotionally ready to be in one. She was used and thrown away only to take up with him the second he came calling. She was a young girl who didn't know her self worth.

They've grown up since they last saw each other...although maybe not all that much. The two of them still bicker back and forth.I really enjoyed reading this book.

She just didn't expect to run into her high school ex, Porter Kelly.Porter has got some baggage of his own.

But this wasn’t her first heartbreak because that honour went to Porter many years ago. So when she runs into him and it appears nothing has changed, he’s as rude as he was when he ended what they had, it just adds insult to injury.There’s so much hate between them, but so much lust, plus a whole lot of push and pull.

My heart hurt for both of them!An apology, a clean slate, and a second chance sounds like a dream come true, but when two people are dealing with the baggage that Madison and Porter are, it’s not that easy.

Even though this heroine is younger than I am now, I was married and divorced in my mid-late 20s just like she is. I also was heartbroken over the end of my marriage, not over my ex husband (though, honestly, at the time I didn't know the difference between the two).This novel resonated with me in a lot of ways.

Madison is back in her small town, after her painful divorce, and the last person she expects to see, is the boy who broke her heart the first time. Porter sure has some sucking up to do, however their feelings for,one another never went away. I enjoyed this Christmas, joyful story.\n\n', '\n\n  Porter and Madison’s second chance love story was sweet and complicated.

  One good scandal deserves another...Lady Alexandrina Lawson has never minded her widowhood. After the disaster that was her first marriage, she found it rather enjoyable, despite the pity she received. What the public saw as devoted mourning to a respected man was, in fact, a complete disinterest in participating in anything Society could offer her ever again. When an invitation to a cousin's London event proves disastrous for Alexandrina, her reputation, and that of her child, her choice becomes simple: rescue or ruin.Enter Taft Debenham, Earl of Harwood.Taft could not have less interest in Lady Lawson or her cold manner, but neither could he stand by and let her suffer a forced marriage to a drunken idiot. Sacrificing himself on the altar of Society, thinking how his own reputation might benefit, he provides a rather clever solution: marry the woman himself, and claim outrage for the offenses against her. Over the protests of his bride, and those of his own sanity, Taft begins the greatest scheme he could ever imagine. Nothing surprises him more than beginning to discover that his wife has a heart beneath her icy exterior.And that he would do almost anything to claim it.Mischief, Mayhem, and Marriage is a sweet Regency romance and can be read as a stand-alone or as the sequel to Rebecca Connolly’s previous novel, The Rivals of Rosennor Hall.

  Falcon has no idea that a run-in with a potential customer at the club’s custom bike shop will lead him on the adventure of a lifetime. He doesn’t know what it is about her that captures his attention and has him giving in to his club to go to the track. He doesn’t need to see how super bikers race. There is no way he and his team are going to customize one for that woman’s man. Imagine his shock when he finds out the bike is for her. She’s the racer! After fighting himself for days, Falcon decides he wants to see more of the beautiful racer. An invitation to their compound for a party gives him time to get to know her, though she pulls away. As they work to get to know each other, they run into a few obstacles along the way, mainly of their own making. Misunderstandings lead to hot make-up sessions. Soleil couldn’t understand why the gorgeous biker seems so against customizing her bike. The rest of his team seem to be on board with it. In an attempt to get him to say yes, she invites them to the track. That leads the way for them to spend more time together. While she knows she has never reacted to a man the way she does him, can she take a chance that he can be the one? As they become closer, things are starting to happen. Some might call them accidents but Falcon and his guys call them attempts to hurt or even kill her. Who is out to prevent her from racing? Is it the racer who seems to half love her and hate her? Is it one of the ones she calls a friend? Others get hurt when she’s the target. She doesn’t know what she should do. Stopping racing in the middle of the season doesn’t seem to be the answer. When the real culprit is revealed, she’s even more devastated than she ever imagined. Come see how Falcon wins the heart of Soleil and makes her Falcon’s She-Devil for life.Warning: This book is intended for adult readers. It contains coarse language, adult situations, discusses events such as stalkers, assault, torture and murder that may trigger some readers. Sexual situations are graphic.

His rock star parents split when he was young, and the father he's never met spent the next twenty years cruising in and out of rehab.

So they strike a deal to be publicity-friendly (fake) boyfriends until the dust has settled. Then they can go their separate ways and pretend it never happened.But the thing about fake-dating is that it can feel a lot like real-dating. And that's when you get used to someone. Start falling for them. Don't ever want to let them go.Discover the LGBT romance about exact opposites falling in perfectly imperfect love that New York Times and USA Today bestselling author CHRISTINA LAUREN calls ""hilarious, witty, tender, and stunning.""

It was British - aka, my actual cup of tea, the bants, the humour, the very relatable conversational, sarcastic tone of the writing which I am not doing justice with these words but I just felt very SEEN, like this book spoke to me and what I enjoy about conversation with it not being polished and perfectly scripted. It was all very welcoming, all bloody hilarious and all very sweet. Oliver could probably have had some more page time - like, if I had to complain about one thing it would be that he was very private for a LI so him opening up more would have been great, but I do understand that it was a literal character flaw for him. I just personally was like OLIVER PLEASE DO THIS FOR ME, MY DUDE. Luc was a delight. He was an absolute adorable mess whom I adore and want to hug fiercely. I loved his arc, I loved his mother and Judy and the five dogs. His father was a twat but I was glad that there was some reality of not everything ending up happy in the end because it made it more real in a way, like more relatable. The friendship group and their bants, actually slayed me. It was so comical. I was here for every aspect of this book.

  IMAGINE YOU STOLE A MILLION DOLLARS –FROM YOUR FIANCÉ. ON THE EVE OF YOUR WEDDING.Dani Silver doesn’t have to imagine. She just did it. And she’s got big plans for her share of that million in cash she and her father scammed from her billionaire fiancé (although strictly speaking, that might make him her ex-fiancé.) Now she’s going to run her own operation—a long con, a dying art currently practiced by only a few old-timers. Fortunately, she learned from the best con man still living, as he’s happy to remind Dani…often—Leroy “Pops” Amadeus Logan, who happens to be her pops.Dani—or Mona Pasternelli, or Carly McNair, or any number of aliases she can pull out of her pocket—has gotten by for the past couple of decades on small cons. She’s got a con for every occasion. Need to get rid of your abusive husband? No murder necessary…it’s so much more satisfying to just mess with him and screw up his life.Thanks to her ex-fiancé, she can afford to put up the front money for the sting she’s got in mind, and she’s looking for a mark. But not just any mark. Her idea of going sort of  straight requires that the mark be crooked and really deserving of being fleeced.The perfect candidate appears in the person of a televangelist who talked the widowed mother of a friend into signing over her house to his church. When the plan runs riotously amok, Dani goes back to Pops for help in figuring out where she went wrong. She backtracks, adjusts course, and—with her delightfully cockamamie crew in tow—the game is on again!Author Lindsay has created a refreshingly human and appealing heroine who’ll keep readers coming back for more. Laugh-out-loud funny, inventive, and appropriately low-life, this delectable first taste of the Dani Silver series will delight fans of heist and caper movies (think THE STING, and all the OCEAN’S films, especially the all-female OCEAN’S EIGHT), TV series about loveable con artists and female criminals, like LEVERAGE, IMPOSTERS, and of course GOOD GIRLS—and books!There just aren’t enough of them. But if you can’t get enough of Donald Westlake’s riotous Dortmunder gang and Lawrence Block’s Bernie Rhodenbarr, Dani’s your new BFF.

It seems like every other book is written by a different author. One version of this author writes books with deeply thought out, complicated,  fascinating lead characters, and ""cannot put it down"" storylines. The other version of this author writes sloppy, immature, unbelievable trope that I would be better off using for bonfire kindling than wasting a few hours reading. Unfortunately, Mr Garcia falls into the latter category. Without giving away the story...even though I have a vivid imagination, I was unable to suspend my belief far enough to to buy that the future PM of England would act the way that Sebastian does whenever he gets into an argument with April (which is a lot). Nor can I believe that legal counsel to a man of such importance would behave the way she does. Is it supposed to be romantic when April brings up a concern to have Sebastian stomp out of the room, slam doors, and repeatedly tell her that he can\'t take any of her *@*!. That is literally repeated in every other scene these two are in. It\'s tiresome, immature, and only served to amp up my dislike for both characters. I could not have cared less if they ended up with one another at the end of the book, so I didn\'t bother finishing the last few chapters. I read that far because I couldn\'t believe how bad it was and kept hoping it would improve. It didn\'t. I was pretty disappointed overall in this effort from T L Swan because I know he/she can do better. I would rather he/she wrote less and focused on fleshing out her characters and storyline more, than churning out books just for the sake of it. This felt like a book that was put out on a deadline.\n\n', '\n\n  Mr. GarciaWritten by: T. L. SwanSometimes you can judge a book by its cover. This cover exudes heat, lots of heat and that’s exactly what you get. But the heat doesn’t always come from the steamy scenes between Sebastian Garcia and April Bennett. It comes from the story of two people, who in any other world but T. L. Swan’s might never have met.Their story happens over a period of time and I’m so glad that Swan did it this way. These characters needed time to grow and to move on before meeting again.Sebastian Garcia, well how does one describe a dominate, hot and steamy man who gives the real him to his friends and family, the business him to the rest of the world and the man who is in search of the right person to April Bennett.April Bennett, a woman whose heart has been broken, yet she picked herself up and moved to London, England. She’s late for work at the coffee shop but takes the time to watch a well-dressed gentleman stop and talk to a man begging for change. He leans in to talk to the man, and then give him 50 pounds she knew he wasn’t an ordinary person. He had compassion and when not long afterwards he shows up at the Coffee shop, she is intrigued. Tall, handsome, caring, she asked for his name to put on his coffee cup (and to find out who he was) that name Sebastian Garcia.The thread that continues to bring these two people together is unbreakable. The good the bad and the ugly is just that, but can these two work through it all?There will swearing at both characters, anger at one, sighs, the odd tear or two and so much more. Seb and April have an attraction that can only be described as fire meets dynamite followed by multiple explosions. Swan delivers wit and humor using Julian Masters and Spencer Jones (his best friends) who are always willing to razz Sebastian and share their friendly and often humorous opinions on just about anything especially if it’s at Sebastian’s expense.Thank you T. L Swan for bringing Sebastian Garcia and April Bennett to readers. They are smart, opinioned, sassy individuals who I loved from start to finish! Your books consistently give readers characters that make us shout, cry, laugh and adore.\n\n', '\n\n  TL Swan has another hit on her hands.  Mr Garcia does not disappoint in any way.  I loved the way the characters develop and how characters from her other books make an appearance.  It is so good, you want to read the end half way thru but you know that Tee will never disappoint her readers so you suck it up and continue reading even tho it is 5 am and you have to be up at 7.  Seb is hot and April is a feisty American who gets her law degree in Britain.  Seb and his friends Julian and Spencer still have breakfast and interact throughtout the book.  If you love Julian and Spencer you will love their content in Mr Garcia.  I gave this book 5 stars and would give it more if I could.  It leaves some questions, will Jeremy get a book, will Jeremy hook up with Adrian who does Willow end up with, so many roads to travel ..........\n\n', '\n\n  OH GOD!!!..This man was the next level!! This book was a rollercoaster of a ride! The book was worth the wait.....Sebastian was sexy as sin. This man had demons. He was damaged and guarded. But man was he so swoony. Dominant and bossy..April is a women that was wronged in life. She had her own obstacles in her life that she had to over come. She faced them head on. This  lady held nothing back. She was the perfect fit for the dominant and bossy man.These two were far from perfect but they went through everything together. So many emotions. He was it for her. She was there for the moments he needed it the most.This book had all the feels..the chemistry was off the charts HOT!!..The swoony moments...the angst. MR. GARCIA...was FILTHY.. ugh.. LOVED IT!!!This man has stolen my heart....All I can say is CASH or CREDIT baby.:P\n\n', ""\n\n  I am blown away by the depth of this story,. It's an outstanding story of strength, emotion, brokenness and love. Both Sebastian and April have been cheated on by their spouses. Both have been left broken, untrusting and looking for satisfaction in the wrong ways. This is a long story. It's full of angst, drama, chemistry and I had my stomach in a knot for most of the story, I was so invested in these two characters.We thankfully get to see Julian Masters and Spencer Jones and the banter and special brand of friendship that they have.

Finally, it turns the tables on one of the hunters sent out to bring it down.Looking for a killer, hunting a lion and defending his own integrity — makes being a cop in L.A. seem like the good old days.

  Rob didn't think of himself as anyone special, but when a pitch-black portal tried to wrap his best friend in chains, he stepped up without thinking and found himself ensnared instead. His moment of heroism results in being torn away from everyone he knew and loved, kidnapped by an unknown force that leaves him with a note in his pocket stating: ""Good luck.""After being thrown into the wilderness of Elatra, a hostile fantasy world ruled by levels, stats, progression, and bizarre video game logic, he finds himself entirely out of his depth. Armed with nothing but a sword and the clothes on his back, he sets out on his the first day, and almost dies. On the second day, he almost dies again. On the third, he began to notice a worrying trend. And almost dies.It doesn't get any easier from there.Overcoming the wilds is just the first step in his journey; the society of Elatra is incredibly hostile to humans, having just come off of a devastating war that left over half the population dead, and getting the locals to kindle their faith and trust the last human in existence is a struggle in and of itself. Between being powerless in a world that hates him and suffering under a System that is altering his mind in unwanted ways, Rob quickly finds that monsters aren't nearly the biggest thing to worry about.As far as LitRPG Isekai adventures go, Rob drew the short straw in many ways. But that's okay - all the bullshit in the world won't keep him down. He'll carve out a place in this world with his bare hands if necessary. He'll survive, and then he'll thrive.Whether anyone wants him to or not.

The worldbuilding is light and uncomplicated, but with significant enough meat in the history to strongly affect the story and give us context for the various antagonists positions.Weaknesses: Too much of the book\'s bulk is taken up by stats and character sheets fluff, but mercifully, specific parts of the book are marked off with notes by the author as to when it\'s safe to skip to the next chapter to resume the story, and I appreciate that a lot. -- The romantic interest could use more substance to her personality, but not nearly so badly as many other books in this genre.  -- The (presumed?) gods of the story feel wholly unnecessary, and I think the book would be stronger without them at all.Overall, though, I\'m praising through faint damnation here. The story plays very well to its strengths and mostly makes allowances for its weaknesses in ways that keep the reader engaged. Dialogue is good, character writing is strong, and the narrative voice is well aware that it\'s job is to keep the reader engaged and entertained.I\'m ready to put this one up on my bookshelf right alongside the ""Unsouled"" series by Will Wight. It\'s that good, and you simply won\'t find better than this in the LitRPG genre.\n\n', '\n\n  Easily my favorite new book this year, for a Potato they have a great sense of character dynamics and pacing.\n\n']"

Well worth checking out\n']","['\n\n  I have a few books by this author that I’ve been collecting simply based in her 5 star record but I hadn’t read any.  This is my first book and I was sorely disappointed.  This is a long book which normally is a good thing for me but 75% is all inner dialogue.  I need dialogue between characters to keep me interested.  I want to read a story that pulls you in as if you are part of it, not have it narrated to me. I can only read what someone is thinking for so long and at 700 pages it was beyond crazy. This book had several editing issues which should have been dealt with before it was up for purchase.  It is not enough to use auto correct as it obviously missed all the wrong word choices and missed words! This book had great potential, but the execution by the author was disappointing.  This story is about Nash and Emery.  They’ve known each other since childhood but come from opposite ends. Emery grew up in wealth and opulence, Nash is the son of one of their employees who’s always in trouble.  The meet several years later but now the tables have turned. Emery is miserable and Nash is a successful and powerful businessman.  Nash just wants revenge and looks for it through Emery. Emery is beautiful inside and out while  Nash, is the ruthless alpha male.\n\n', '\n\n  I honestly can’t believe I read it so quickly. It’s a decent book sometimes drags on and a lot of unnecessary filler things but it made me laugh out loud and its worth the read\n\n', '\n\n  Wow was my reaction when I finished this book, I was blown away.  It is completely different to anything else I have read; it was poignant, funny and truly lovely.  The parallel dialogue between Emery and Nash in person and on the app where they had no knowledge of the other’s identity was intriguing and a very clever tool of the author.  There were times I cried because it was sad and times I cried because it was so beautiful and the epilogue blew me away and the epilogue was stunning.  I can not recommend this book highly enough.\n\n', '\n\n  Parker S. Huntington gives us a slow-burn enemies to lovers romance. Nash is a broody hero that you can’t help but swoon over. Emery is quirky and you can’t help but love it. The chemistry between the two despite the age gap is perfection. A pair that couldn’t be more different found compatibility with each other. Two people broken and destroyed by lies and hurt find love and the journey to their hea was a ride that you don’t want to miss. It is mesmerizing and will have you fully invested from the opening pages.\n\n', '\n\n  A scrumptious read but man am I stuffed; pleasurably so!Loved the layout and esthetics of the book. I took almost a full page of notes BEFORE starting into the novel proper. *This is a mega long story, so, be sure to set aside a large length of time in order to devour this scrumptious read. Well written unique story that moves along easily. An excellent depiction of greed, intrigue, romance, sabatoge, loyalty, integrity, familial machinations, with the players clearly outlined. Characterizations were realistic and believable because Ms. Huntington allowed us to view a character, flaws and all. It is well worth taking the time to immerse yourself into the murky world that Ms. Huntington details so vividly. Such a thorough job was done, on every component of the story, that a reader walks away replete. Very much recommended reading!PSThis reader is so glad Ms. Huntingdon wrote this type of novel versus another mafia themed story, as I would not have had the pleasure of ""meeting her acquaintance"" via her ""Devious Lies"" novel. I hope to meet up with her in the not too distant future.PPSI also loved the fact that Ms. Huntington bundled all her story within one novel, versus breaking up the continuity of the story into four or five separate novels. Thank you for this.*Excerpt of the esthetics and the extra detailing Ms. Huntington brought to her novel:""Fate whispers to the warrior,\'You cannot withstand the storm,\'and the warrior whispers back,\'I am the storm.\'  -- UnknownTacenda / ta-\'chen-da- Things that are not to be spoken about or made public.- Things that are best left unsaid.Origin Latin participle, \'taceo\' - \'I am silent\'.Taceo also the verb for \'I am still or at rest\'.Taceo reminds us that silence isn\'t a sign of weakness.It is a sign of rest, of certainty, of contentment.Silence is the best response to people who don\'t deserve your words.""These sections were informative , interesting and remind me a bit about Linguistics.\n\n', '\n\n  Despite being an (mostly) unnecessary 700 pages long - this random book I got from Kindle Unlimited, was the surprising success of January.The book started a little shaky and overwrought for me. The first couple of chapters in Emery POV made me think this would be something I would give up on quickly. She was a little too precious and OTT for me in the beginning - she flipped through rage, silence, rebelliousness and drawn to Nash (our hero) in the space of three chapters. I was confused till about the end of Chapter 4.However, something happened after the whiplash went away. I got into the book and the relationship between Nash and Emery was quite fun. I liked the bite in their conversations and the relationship. It got a bit twee sometimes but I think that was because of the length.In the end, despite not being able to explain it, this worked for me. I even found theEmery’s habit of quoting obscure words, charming. I must give credit to the writer for this. I am going to check more out by her. Find of January 2020 for me!\n\n']"

  “A breath of fresh air . . . the vision is deeply imagined, very complete and controlled . . . Gibson is truly brilliant.”—Washington Times magazine From a true master of science fiction comes a collection of short stories that show how, no matter the length, Gibson is one of the greatest writers working today.Known for his seminal science fiction novel Neuromancer, and for the acclaimed books Pattern Recognition, The Peripheral, and Agency, William Gibson is actually best when writing short fiction. Tautly written and suspenseful, Burning Chrome collects 10 short stories, including some written with Bruce Sterling, John Shirley, and Michael Swanwick, and with a preface from Bruce Sterling, now available for the first time in trade paperback. These brilliant, high-resolution stories show Gibson’s characters and intensely realized worlds at their absolute best, from the chip-enhanced couriers of “Johnny Mnemonic” to the street-tech melancholy of “Burning Chrome.”  Read more  ","['4.0 out of 5 stars', '5.0 out of 5 stars', '5.0 out of 5 stars', '5.0 out of 5 stars', '5.0 out of 5 stars', '3.0 out of 5 stars', '4.0 out of 5 stars', '5.0 out of 5 stars']","['\nEdition counts\n', '\nexcellent\n', '\nFive Stars\n', '\nFive Stars\n', '\nFive Stars\n', '\nBook came slightly damaged, creases in the covers.\n', '\nClassic SF Short Stories\n', '\nToo short.\n']","['\n\n  Stories are great.

I personally loved Johnny Mnemonic and New Rose Hotel, which are pure Gibson.\n\n', '\n\n  Good book.\n\n', ""\n\n  As title, I'm sure the book is good, but it's not very good condition\n\n"", '\n\n  Burning Chrome is a collection of ten short stories by cyber-punk innovator William Gibson, three of which are collaborations with other authors. It\'s an eclectic ride as a whole. There is no overriding theme that ties all of the stories together - they range from cyberpunk to surreal. Gibson\'s prose can be very poetic and he does an excellent job of setting the mood in each story. Even when his characters aren\'t very likeable, you can still identify with their emotions.""Johnny Mnemonic"", ""New Rose Hotel"" and ""Burning Chrome"" are written in the same ""Sprawl"" setting as many of Gibson\'s novels. They are sharp and explosive cyberpunk stories that grab your attention and run. ""The Gernsback Continuum"" and ""The Belonging Kind"" are trips through what could be present day America with surreal twists. ""Red Star, Winter Orbit"", written with Bruce Sterling, is the poignant tale of an aging Russian cosmonaut on an equally aging space station. ""Hinterlands"" is an eerie view of how far humans will go to satisfy the need for progress and exploration. ""Fragments of a Hologram Rose"", ""The Winter Market"" and ""Dogfight"" are powerful studies of emotion, need, and what it means to be human.Overall, I enjoyed Burning Chrome. Gibson\'s writing style is fun to read - he can establish mood and atmosphere in a few short sentences. I also like that he uses technology as a means not an end - the focus in the stories is how people interact with each other and technology intstead of showcasing what a cool idea a particular future technology would be. His stories tend to deal with the grittier side of human nature, and are not always comfortable to read, but they make you think.\n\n', '\n\n  All of the stories in this brief collection were astounding.  Never very involved with hard science, opting more for dark, intense noir shaded by futuristic technology, Gibson creates a variety of worlds that amaze you with their detail and imagery.  He is one of the few writers who approaches science-fiction this way, giving his reader a view of society from the ground up.  He doesn\'t try that often to explain why things have happened, or why the world is a certain way; instead he drops you into his stories and forces you to come to terms with his reality.The Sprawl series, prefacing his first three novels (Neuromancer, Count Zero, Mona Lisa Overdrive) are the clearest standouts in this collection, even though I thought ""Johnny Mnemonic"" tried to do too much in too little space.  ""New Rose Hotel"" and ""Burning Chrome"" are absolute classics of cyberpunk, moreso than most books that find their way into the genre.""The Gernsback Continuum"" is uncommonly lighthearted for Gibson, and whether or not you believe Bruce Sterling\'s comments in the introduction, it\'s a great story. It\'s barely science fiction, but since the ""cyberpunk"" label was invented after Gibson\'s debut, this isn\'t surprising.Gibson\'s collaboration with John Shirley, ""The Belonging Kind"", is also incredible. It\'s interesting to try to figure out each writer\'s influence. Like the previous story, it\'s more surreal than scientific.""Fragments of a Hologram Rose"" and ""The Winter Market"" are fantastic stories that combine complex plots, characters, and romance with vivid near-future settings. These are some of the most powerful statements of the effects of technology on humanity in any field of literature.All of these are intense stories; the only real problem is there aren\'t more of them. It saddens me that Gibson slowed down his writing after ""Neuromancer"" - the sequels never measured up to the original, and his later books were like diluted versions of his earlier work.\n\n']"

  WINNER OF THE 2021 BOOKER PRIZEA NEW YORK TIMES EDITORS’ CHOICEA modern family saga written in gorgeous prose by three-time Booker Prize-shortlisted author Damon Galgut.Haunted by an unmet promise, the Swart family loses touch after the death of their matriarch. Adrift, the lives of the three siblings move separately through the uncharted waters of South Africa; Anton, the golden boy who bitterly resents his life’s unfulfilled potential; Astrid, whose beauty is her power; and the youngest, Amor, whose life is shaped by a nebulous feeling of guilt.Reunited by four funerals over three decades, the dwindling family reflects the atmosphere of its country—one of resentment, renewal, and, ultimately, hope. The Promise is an epic drama that unfurls against the unrelenting march of national history, sure to please current fans and attract many new ones.“Simply: you must read it.”—Claire Messud, Harper’s Magazine  Read more  ","['4.0 out of 5 stars', '5.0 out of 5 stars', '5.0 out of 5 stars', '4.0 out of 5 stars', '5.0 out of 5 stars', '1.0 out of 5 stars']","['\nA Tragic Tale of decline but with a glimmer of hope in integrity\n', '\nanonymous review:\n', '\nWonderful Book\n', '\nTends to rable\n', '\nAn excellent book\n', '\nNot my favourite read.\n']","['\n\n  This story is the rather morbid portrayal of an Afrikaner family struggling and failing to come to terms with the new dispensation in South Africa. A Mother dies. Having converted to the jewish faith, she is not allowed to be buried with her family which leads to contention. Also her promise to their black servant, that she will receive land and a house, casts a shadow of guilt, division and obligation on the family. The father flees into a distorted form of his religion, guided by shady spiritual mentors (Shady spiritual mentors seems to be a theme throughout. It is sometimes overdone, giving the impression that the writer has huge issues with religion and religious leaders and wants to settle a score). Three children inherit the family farm. Anton, the soul scarred embittered son who dreams big but follows through on nothing. Astrid the self centered daughter who turns into an immoral hedonist. Amor, the youngest neglected one who breaks out and build our own life as a nurse in Durban far away from the family drama. Astrid gets killed in a car high jacking and Anton commits suicide.

  I took home more in a year than the CEOs of McDonalds, IKEA, Ford, Motorola, and Yahoo….combined….as a kid in my twenties….using the $100M Offer method. It works. And it will work for you. Not that long ago though, my business had gotten so bad that I literally couldn’t even give my services away for free. At the end of each month, I would look at my bank account hoping to see progress (but there wasn’t). I knew something had to change...but what? Over the next 48 months, I went from losing money to making $36 for every $1 spent. In that time period, we generated over $120,000,000 across four different industries: service, ecommerce, software, and brick & mortar. But, unlike everyone else, we didn’t have great funnels, great ads, or a wealthy niche. In fact, we didn’t even send emails until we had crossed $50M in sales(!). Instead, we were able to do this one thing really well….we created offers so good, people felt stupid saying no. Here’s exactly what this book will show you how to do: How To Charge A Lot More Than You Currently Are… a. The Tiny Market Big Money Process we use to laser focus on niche markets overflowing with cash b. The “Unfair” Pricing formula….how we 100x’d our pricing (and got more people to say yes….for real) c. The Value Flip...so you never get price compared again (that’s a promise) d. The Virtuous Cycle of Price...use it to outspend your competition (for good) while using your product to attract the best talent 2. How To Make Your Product So Good, Prospects Find A Way To Pay For It e. The Unbeatable Value Equation….to make what you sell worth more than your prospects have ever received f. The Delivery Cube….to make delivering your products and services cost less but provide more g. The Trim & Stack Hack….to maximize profit using the absolute best delivery methods. (This has never been shared publicly and was how we made $17M in profit on $28M in revenue in a year when I was 28 years old) 3. How To Enhance Your Offer So Much, Prospects Buy Without Hesitating h. The Scarcity Stack….how to use the three different types of scarcity in every offer you make (without lying) to get people to buy the moment you ask i. The “Everyday” Urgency Blueprint... to get prospects to buy RIGHT NOW, using everyday life to create real, ethical time pressure j. Unbeatable Bonuses...and watch your prospects' hesitations melt away as they begin reading their credit cards to you before you even finish! k. God-mode Guarantees...so good they make anyone say yes (even people who would never normally consider buying). I’ll show you how to stack and layer all 4 types of guarantees together. I even give you my 13 favorite guarantees word-for-word to swipe for yourself. l. Magic Naming Formula to get the absolute highest response rates and conversion rates from everything you do to get new clients And so much more… The methods contained within this book are so simple, so instantaneous, and so effective, it’s as if they work by magic. If you implement even one tactic in this book, you’ll see the change in your prospects' demeanor. And you’ll know the $100M Offer method worked when you start hearing “What do I need to do to move forward?” ...before you even ask for the sale.

  A grand, devastating portrait of three generations of the Sackler family, famed for their philanthropy, whose fortune was built by Valium and whose reputation was destroyed by OxyContin, by the prize-winning, bestselling author of Say Nothing The Sackler name adorns the walls of many storied institutions—Harvard, the Metropolitan Museum of Art, Oxford, the Louvre. They are one of the richest families in the world, known for their lavish donations to the arts and the sciences. The source of the family fortune was vague, however, until it emerged that the Sacklers were responsible for making and marketing a blockbuster painkiller that was the catalyst for the opioid crisis.Empire of Pain begins with the story of three doctor brothers, Raymond, Mortimer and the incalculably energetic Arthur, who weathered the poverty of the Great Depression and appalling anti-Semitism. Working at a barbaric mental institution, Arthur saw a better way and conducted groundbreaking research into drug treatments. He also had a genius for marketing, especially for pharmaceuticals, and bought a small ad firm.Arthur devised the marketing for Valium, and built the first great Sackler fortune. He purchased a drug manufacturer, Purdue Frederick, which would be run by Raymond and Mortimer. The brothers began collecting art, and wives, and grand residences in exotic locales. Their children and grandchildren grew up in luxury.Forty years later, Raymond’s son Richard ran the family-owned Purdue. The template Arthur Sackler created to sell Valium—co-opting doctors, influencing the FDA, downplaying the drug’s addictiveness—was employed to launch a far more potent product: OxyContin. The drug went on to generate some thirty-five billion dollars in revenue, and to launch a public health crisis in which hundreds of thousands would die.This is the saga of three generations of a single family and the mark they would leave on the world, a tale that moves from the bustling streets of early twentieth-century Brooklyn to the seaside palaces of Greenwich, Connecticut, and Cap d’Antibes to the corridors of power in Washington, D.C.  Empire of Pain chronicles the multiple investigations of the Sacklers and their company, and the scorched-earth legal tactics that the family has used to evade accountability. The history of the Sackler dynasty is rife with drama—baroque personal lives; bitter disputes over estates; fistfights in boardrooms; glittering art collections; Machiavellian courtroom maneuvers; and the calculated use of money to burnish reputations and crush the less powerful.Empire of Pain is a masterpiece of narrative reporting and writing, exhaustively documented and ferociously compelling. It is a portrait of the excesses of America’s second Gilded Age, a study of impunity among the super elite and a relentless investigation of the naked greed and indifference to human suffering that built one of the world’s great fortunes.

At first, controlled substances such as morphine and heroin were not readily available to the general public. To have access to them, you needed contacts in the underworld of drug pushers, a place where ordinary people were not generally keen to venture into. A fix would most often require sticking a needle into one's veins, something that many people were afraid to try.  That, to a large extent, kept the lid on the widespread proliferation of the lethal drugs.  But in recent years, things got a lot easier for the addicts and the vulnerable.  The drugs became available in pill form and legally dispensed by doctors and pharmacies as medication to control pain.  One of those drugs that became well known, mostly because it ended up contributing to the crisis more than any other, was the FDA approved pain medication OxyContin.This book is the story of how OxyContin (and its predecessor Oxycodone) were invented and promoted, first as a legitimate drug to control chronic pain that soon hooked unsuspecting users into solid dependency from which it was nearly impossible to move away from.  But that outcome, that ended up costing he lives of over half a million Americans and countless others around the world, was the result of unethical – i.e. criminal – actions of one company, Connecticut-based Purdue Pharma, and one family, the Sacklers that owned it and controlled every aspect of its operations.  The purpose was to generate as much wealth for themselves as possible and more; and they did, billions of dollars.I decided to buy this book after listening to an interview with the author broadcast on a CBC morning radio show in early May 2021. I'm always on the lookout for history books – I never read fiction – and this sounded interesting even though (or because) I knew next to nothing about the drug industry.  In fact, until I read the book, I was under the impression that OxyContin was manufactured in some remote place somewhere in China and shipped to North America just to cause trouble!The book is well written, easy to read, a bit long – could be about 30% shorter – even though time was not an issue since I read it during a period of COVID-19 confinement.  One thing that I shall remember about this story is the fact that Isaac Sackler, the patriarch of the family, told his sons when they were young that it was more important to preserve their Good Name than whatever wealth and material goods they had acquired over the years (or something to that effect). They can always rebuild their wealth, he told them, but if they lose their good name, they will never get it back.  It turns out in the end that the family members held on to much of their wealth – despite paying billions in fines – but they lost their Good Name big time!\n\n"", '\n\n  I had previously read Keefe\'s book ""Say Nothing"" which educated me on the Irish \'Troubles\'. Empire of Pain was another triumph for Keefe.  Compelling journalism that is hard to put down and captures the details of the behind-the-scenes tactics of Big Pharma and particularly Purdue Pharma and the Sackler family in driving the opioid crisis.In the era of crashing 737 Max Boeing jets and devastating Oxycontin, one is left wondering about the corruption of the regulatory environment and the businesses happy to exploit for profit.\n\n', '\n\n  Well researched and written. It\'s the story of the Sackler family, the development and promotion of OxyContin by their company Purdue. EMPIRE OF PAIN  tells the tail of how a higly addictive narcotic was ""legally"" released into society and the fallout. The irony of the profits being donated by the millions so the Sackler name remained on into perpetuity is not loss.  It\'s disturbing how power and money can ""legally"" cause such havoc and destruction in our society.I had to read the book in ""chunks"" to properly digest the horror. As many, I had a close relative, a well-educated retired nurse, becone a victim of the over prescribing doctors in Florida.  War on drugs takes on a whole new meaning. A hard lesson but a MUST read!!\n\n', ""\n\n  If you are like me and had only read snippets about the Oxy scandal but wanted to learn more, then this is the book to read. Well researched and excellently written, this one spares no member of the family and reveals the depth of The Sackler's tone deaf greed and corruption. They made millions off of this drug with no regard for the pain and suffering that it caused. They simply doubled down whenever they were threatened and lawyered up. An appalling family that deserved to fall from grace in a spectacular fashion. An excellent read!\n\n"", '\n\n  Patrick Radden Keefe lays out a sobering account of the Sackler family’s decade long campaign of predatory marketing and deliberate obfuscations.

But this book lays out the Sacklers’ responsibility in this public health crisis.\n\n', '\n\n  Until recently, the fabulously wealthy Sackler family was known for its philanthropic largesse.. No one knew much about where their  fortune came from.  And  no one really cared - until the OxyContin crisis helped to launch the devastating opioid epidemic. . This is the story of the fortune that Oxycontin  created, and of the family that it enriched.  It’s also a fascinating account of  the development  of the modern drug marketing industry,  in which the Sacklers  played a crucial role.  Highly readable; full of descriptive detail and insight.\n\n', ""\n\n  Excellent book....Great detail of the Opioid Epidemic and it's originators....well written...and well researched...\n\n"", '\n\n  Very interesting read about money, greed, ambition, and the lengths some will go to for success.

  Based on the true story of a brave German nurse tasked with caring for Auschwitz’s youngest prisoners, Auschwitz Lullaby brings to life the story of Helene Hannemann—a woman who sacrificed everything for family and fought furiously for the children she hoped to save.  On an otherwise ordinary morning in 1943, Helene Hannemann is preparing her five children for the day when the German police arrive at her home. Helene’s worst fears come true when the police, under strict orders from the SS, demand that her children and husband, all of Romani heritage, be taken into custody. Though Helene is German and safe from the forces invading her home, she refuses to leave her family—sealing her fate in a way she never could have imagined. After a terrifying trek across the continent, Helene and her family arrive at Auschwitz and are thrown into the chaos of the camp. Her husband, Johann, is separated from them, but Helene remains fiercely protective of her children and those around her. When the powers-that-be discover that Helene is not only a German but also a trained nurse, she is forced into service at the camp hospital, which is overseen by the notorious Dr. Mengele himself. Helene is under no illusions in terms of Dr. Mengele’s intentions, but she agrees to cooperate when he asks her to organize a day care and school for the Romani children in the camp. Though physically and emotionally brutalized by the conditions at Auschwitz, Helene musters the strength to protect the children in her care at any cost. Through sheer force of will, Helene provides a haven for the children of Auschwitz—an act of kindness and selflessness so great that it illuminates the darkest night of human history.  Based on a true story, Mario Escobar’s Auschwitz Lullaby demonstrates the power of sacrifice and the strength of human dignity—even when all hope seems lost.  Praise for Auschwitz Lullaby:""Auschwitz Lullaby grabbed my heart and drew me in. A great choice for readers of historical fiction.""—Irma Joubert, author of The Girl from the TrainAn international bestsellerFull-length World War II historical novelA finalist for 2019’s Empik Award for LiteratureIncludes discussion questions for book clubs, research notes from the author, and a historical timeline  Read more  ","['5.0 out of 5 stars', '5.0 out of 5 stars', '5.0 out of 5 stars', '5.0 out of 5 stars', '5.0 out of 5 stars', '5.0 out of 5 stars', '4.0 out of 5 stars', '5.0 out of 5 stars']","['\nMezmerizong\n', '\nAmazing\n', '\nHard read but well written\n', '\nRemember the holocaust!\n', '\nBook\n', '\nGreat novel\n', '\nGreat book\n', '\nYou need to had this to your personal library\n']","['\n\n  I have studied the holocaust through I of Jerusalem and Had Vashem and read many books about it but this book was spell binding.

  This in-depth commentary on the lost material of The Gospel of Mary Magdalene presents Jesus’ most important—and misunderstood—disciple as you’ve never seen her before   Discovered in fragments in Egypt in 1945, The Gospel of Mary remains one of the most controversial texts of early Christianity. This translation of Mary’s teachings, from the original Greek and Coptic, offers a unique new perspective: authors Claire Nahmad and Margaret Bailey utilized “inner listening” to uncover lost material, and they present Mary’s ideas in the form of a dialogue between the (risen) Savior and His disciples.    Most importantly, The Secret Teachings of Mary Magdalene includes a description by Mary of special revelations given to her by Jesus. Nahmad and Bailey argues that Mary was not just the consort of Christ but the feminine Christ herself, and in their view, the partnership between Jesus and Mary exemplifies the crucial balance of male and female in spiritual and corporeal life. It’s an interpretation that uncovers a rich subtext in Mary's words, offering wisdom on an extraordinary range of concerns—from the origins of the human race to the pathway to Christlike consciousness.

  Academy Award–winning actress, producer, and entrepreneur Reese Witherspoon invites you into her world, where she infuses the southern style, parties, and traditions she loves with contemporary flair and charm.Reese Witherspoon’s grandmother Dorothea always said that a combination of beauty and strength made southern women “whiskey in a teacup.” We may be delicate and ornamental on the outside, she said, but inside we’re strong and fiery. Reese’s southern heritage informs her whole life, and she loves sharing the joys of southern living with practically everyone she meets. She takes the South wherever she goes with bluegrass, big holiday parties, and plenty of Dorothea’s fried chicken. It’s reflected in how she entertains, decorates her home, and makes holidays special for her kids—not to mention how she talks, dances, and does her hair (in these pages, you will learn Reese’s fail-proof, only slightly insane hot-roller technique). Reese loves sharing Dorothea’s most delicious recipes as well as her favorite southern traditions, from midnight barn parties to backyard bridal showers, magical Christmas mornings to rollicking honky-tonks. It’s easy to bring a little bit of Reese’s world into your home, no matter where you live. After all, there’s a southern side to every place in the world, right?

From start to finish I was mesmerised with the plot and the strong forceful characters. This story was like stepping into a bond film; from the very first page until the very last the excitement, the tension, all the twists and turns made for a phenomenal read.Liam Black is a presence to be very aware of. Head of the Irish Mafia, by all means, he is a dangerous man to be around. Alpha male personified, possessive, gorgeous, brooding and sex on legs, woman fall at his feet and men quiver in his presence. He always gets what he wants but he might have to work a little harder when he sees Truvy. He makes no bones about wanting her, only she might have other ideas.Truvy's character was so enjoyable to read, at first she came across as a little shy and quiet but when the going got tough, Truvy got going. What a little firecracker Truvy turned out to be, but will the Irish charm of Liam be enough to win her around, or when she finds out just who and what he does for a living make her run for the hills. Truvy might not have any choice in the matter.I can only describe this book as totally addictive, I couldn't put it down. It basically had it all. Wonderful characters; Liam was to die for, I literally drooled all the way through this book. The plot was sensational and kept me on the edge of my seat, the sex was hot and erotic yet beautifully written, in fact, the whole of the book was perfection.

This story was everything! It’s witty, intense, funny and very sexy. The chemistry between Tru and Liam is so intense and hot that it oozes off the pages and lit my kindle on fire! These two had me laughing out loud and falling head over heels in love with them.Tru made me laugh so hard I was snorting. She’s sexy, smart, very funny and utterly fierce. This girl was raised by a fierce independent woman and she doesn’t let anything get in her way!“l don’t know what kind of woman you’re used to, but my mother didn’t raise a worker bee. She raised a queen... And I don’t give away the honey for free.”Liam is the ultimate sexy alpha male. He’s mysterious, broody and intense. Liam can set anyone’s panties on fire just with his smoulder! Just reading about him made me a gooey puddle! Together Liam and Tru have an undeniably intense connection. Their sexual chemistry is sizzling hot and highly combustible!This story will captivate and entertain you from the very beginning and keep you completely enthralled until the very end. It's exciting and suspenseful and will keep you on the edge of your seat with all of the surprises and little twists and turns throughout. The ending will literally blow your mind!Phenomenal! Highly recommend.\n\n"", '\n\n  If you love a story about bad boys then you will love this one.  Liam Black is the baddest of the bad, that\'s until he is brought to his knees by Tru the sassy take no s*** waitress at Buddy\'s diner.Tru is intrigued by this mysterious stranger in black who has been coming into the diner for eleven months just for coffee.  She has named him Wolf because he reminds her of a dangerous animal,  and though he never speaks to her he spends the whole time staring at her.One night she feels brave enough to talk to him though she doesn\'t get much in the way of answers but every one he gives her seems to have an underlying warning for her to stay away from him.  Despite that, he comes to her rescue the next night when she is jumped by three men outside the diner and he kills all three without blinking an eye.This is the start of the arrangement between Tru and her big bad Wolf where he wants her to stay with him at his home for a month at the end of which it will be all over for them and they go back to  their normal lives.Whew, hot and steamy!!! love scenes, and so much mystery and intrigue as Tru finds out how dangerous the man she is rapidly falling in love with really is but even so she wants a future with him.  Liam has put his ""business"" on hold to indulge himself with Tru, but will he be able to go back to the cold, hard man he was before, once their arrangement is ended or has she changed his life?As always with Ms Geissinger\'s books this one grabbed my attention from the beginning and didn\'t let me go until the end, and I could have read so much more!  Ms Gessinger is becoming the master (or mistress?) of writing stories with a seismic twist in the tale that you never see coming and she definitely does not disappoint with this ending.Brilliantly written characters, and an intriguing storyline, what else can I say except that it deserves way more than 5 stars and I am left wondering if we will see one of the characters have his own story in the future?\n\n']"

I started with book 2; LOVED it! Read book 3; LOVED it even more, which i didn't think was possible. THEN i read this one. To say I LOVED it most just doesn't seem adequate. Odette Stone can write an alpha male to perfection. And the best part is her women are just as strong and fabulous. All the suspense, all the feelings, all the sexy steamy stuff.

The story line is heart stretching and heated. I am hooked.\n\n"", '\n\n  (My review may contain spoilers). When I started reading this book, I was impressed and hopeful that it would be a good read, unfortunately that was not the case. The main story centres around Rory and Max and if the writer had stuck to that part of the tale, all would have been good. Instead we get one convoluted plot twist after another. It just never ends. To top it off, Rory\'s parents, who she claims have always ""loved and supported her,"" are manipulative and deceitful. Her Dad has his own agenda and for someone who is supposed to be grooming Rory to take his place as GM one day, he undermines and questions her decisions at every opportunity. He is a major douche canoe to be blunt. I plowed through until the end because I needed to know what would happen to Max and Rory, but that was the only reason. I was really disappointed with this book.\n\n', ""\n\n  Puck Me Secretly is the first installment of the Vancouver Wolves Hockey series where all the books are standalone with some characters overlapping.Rory first meets Max who sits next to her on their plane as it crashes. He takes care of her after the crash then leaves in the night after a very intimate exchange. The story walks through Rory's journey as assistant GM to not only help Max, the troubled hockey player with his last shot at playing in the NHL but her struggle to fit in and be accepted despite the nepotism of her position.Stone’s novel embodies the essence of hockey, Pastpaced, drama-filled, and a team to back you up every step of the way. While reading this book you connect with Rory and her constant struggle to fit and be accepted in a position she didn't want to begin with. Stone actualizes Rory's feelings and makes them your own. Stone also makes it easy to sympathize with Max’s struggles to further engulf you in the world of the Vancouver Wolves. I love the way this novel really embodied hockey and didn't just have it as a background fact but really showed you the inner workings of the NHL world. True hockey fans will appreciate this addition to the novel.If you are a hockey fan who loves a slow burn, and forbidden love stories Puck me secretly is the book for you. With actual insight into the hockey world, this novel is more than your typical romance.\n\n"", '\n\n  I decided to take a chance and try this story by Odette Stone and I loved it!

  During the Global Financial Crisis in 2008, our financial infrastructure failed.  Govern­ments bailed out the very institutions that let the economy down. This episode spurred a serious rethink of our financial system. Does it make any sense that it takes two days to settle a stock transaction? Why do retailers, operating on razor thin margins, have to pay 3% for every customer credit card swipe? Why does it take two days to transfer money from a bank account to a brokerage—or any other company? Why are savings rates miniscule or negative? Why is it so difficult for entrepreneurs to get financ­ing at traditional banks? In DeFi and the Future of Finance, Campbell R. Harvey, Ashwin Ramachandran and Joey Santoro, introduce the new world of Decen­tralized Finance. The book argues that the current financial landscape is ripe for dis­ruption and we are seeing, in real time, the reinvention of finance. The authors provide the reader with a clear assessment of the problems with the current financial system and how DeFi solves many of these problems. The essence of DeFi is that we interact with peers—there is no brick and mortar and all of the associated costs. Savings and lending are reinvented. Trading takes place with algorithms far re­moved from traditional brokerages. The book conducts a deep dive on some of the most innovative protocols such as Uniswap and Compound. Many of the companies featured in the book you might not have heard of—however, you will in the future. As with any new technology, there are a myriad of risks and the authors carefully catalogue these risks and assess which ones can be successfully mitigated. Ideally suited for people working in any part of the finance industry as well as finan­cial policy makers, DeFi and the Future of Finance gives readers a vision of the future. The world of finance will fundamentally be changed over the coming decade. The book enables you to become part of the disruption – not the target of the disruption.

  TestFirst published in 2001, American Gods became an instant classic—an intellectual and artistic benchmark from the multiple-award-winning master of innovative fiction, Neil Gaiman. Now discover the mystery and magic of American Gods in this tenth anniversary edition. Newly updated and expanded with the author’s preferred text, this commemorative volume is a true celebration of a modern masterpiece by the one, the only, Neil Gaiman.A storm is coming . . . Locked behind bars for three years, Shadow did his time, quietly waiting for the magic day when he could return to Eagle Point, Indiana. A man no longer scared of what tomorrow might bring, all he wanted was to be with Laura, the wife he deeply loved, and start a new life.But just days before his release, Laura and Shadow’s best friend are killed in an accident. With his life in pieces and nothing to keep him tethered, Shadow accepts a job from a beguiling stranger he meets on the way home, an enigmatic man who calls himself Mr. Wednesday. A trickster and rogue, Wednesday seems to know more about Shadow than Shadow does himself.Life as Wednesday’s bodyguard, driver, and errand boy is far more interesting and dangerous than Shadow ever imagined—it is a job that takes him on a dark and strange road trip and introduces him to a host of eccentric characters whose fates are mysteriously intertwined with his own. Along the way Shadow will learn that the past never dies; that everyone, including his beloved Laura, harbors secrets; and that dreams, totems, legends, and myths are more real than we know. Ultimately, he will discover that beneath the placid surface of everyday life a storm is brewing—an epic war for the very soul of America—and that he is standing squarely in its path.Relevant and prescient, American Gods has been lauded for its brilliant synthesis of “mystery, satire, sex, horror, and poetic prose” (Michael Dirda, Washington Post Book World) and as a modern phantasmagoria that “distills the essence of America” (Seattle Post-Intelligencer). It is, quite simply, an outstanding work of literary imagination that will endure for generations.

The shortest distance between two points is a straight line, Gaiman took me on a meandering road trip to places I never wanted to see.Don’t get me wrong, it’s not all bad. Gaiman has created some interesting, well developed characters. The story is filled with moments of brilliance, with excellent dialogue and incredible humor. He has done an excellent job of getting into the “American” psyche, the old traditions that people brought from the old country and how it all has been watered down and lost through the great American melting pot. These gods are being slowly replaced by the new gods that we worship, the story is even more relevant now than it was when it was written.My biggest problem with the book was that I just didn’t care. For all of its brilliance, there was not connection created. It’s hard to be passionate about a passionless character. Shadow was a pawn, a tool used for everyone’s games, and he let it happen; he went with the flow and never got riled up.All in all, was American Gods a bad book? Absolutely not! Was it a great book? Not for me, but I suppose that depends on what you are looking for. Generally, I read for fun…American Gods was not a fun book. Is Neil Gaiman an incredible author? Heck, yes. Will I be lining up for the next chapter in Shadow’s story? No way.\n\n', ""\n\n  I really liked this book but still contemplated putting it down a time or two. The story is sublime, the histories and myths are interwoven beautifully and that makes it a captivating and interesting novel to read. However, the female characters were definitely written with the male gaze, they're simplified often and appear as something parallel to the manic pixy dream girl, if she had to fight for her life, or was already dead, or was also a Goddess. I didn't realise what an excellent job the TV series had done in developing the character arcs of the women in the novel. I decided to push past this because it's incredible fiction in every other respect, but if that's something that would bug you beyond reprieve, then I wouldn't bother with this book.\n\n"", '\n\n  I can see why a lot of people dislike this novel, because nothing really happens. All the rules of drama get tossed out the window. Which is why I like it. It\'s kind of like Indiana Jones and Raiders of the Lost Ark, in that Indy never actually has an impact on the plot beyond being there and the events would have gone on as they went on. In a sense, American Gods has a kind of ""all for nothing"" vibe, which I really dug.All in all, a really cool novel, and I like the idea of gods having different personalities in different regions, in a sense adapting as their adherents first bringing them to America, then forgetting them.\n\n', ""\n\n  I began my journey with American Gods through the television show and decided pick up the book after the ending of season 3, and the unfortunate news that there might not be a season 4. I needed answers, and I got them in the best way. If you even like the show the tiniest bit, read the book. It is a thousand times better. If you like Shadow and don't really care that much for the other characters, this book is for you, as it follows him throughout the entire thing, give or take a few chapters. This book screams satisfying ending. Thank you, Neil Gaiman!\n\n"", ""\n\n  Many of my friends read and recommended this book in highschool, now ten years later I finally got myself a copy. I can see why many find this book enjoyable and why it won so many awards in its time. It's very distinct in its approach to building plot and characters. If you're a new reader, this may be just the book that delights you to dive into the fantasy genre. However, I found myself struggling to get through this novel. Perhaps this is because I've been reading fantasy my whole life and this just wasn't anything  super new or intriguing to me.The main character mostly floats through the plot and the plot is like a maze with a hundred dead ends. Every chapter introduces a dozen new concepts without tying up any loose ends.  To be honest, I tried my best and only got through 46% of it before I couldn't force myself to read another word.A super interesting concept that's well drawn out, but it failed to take it anywhere substantial, instead feeding you little spoonfuls of icing when you want the whole cake. Since I did not finish it, I assume the whole cake is given at the end, but I want willing to stick around when there are so many other things to read.\n\n"", ""\n\n  Love Gaiman's writing BUT this whole enhanced content thing has left me a little pissed.  When I inititialy downloaded this version, I figured it didn't work because the Kindle Paperwhite isn't set up for it.  I've since tried it on my Samsung S2 and still doesn't work.  Does it work on Apple products, who knows?  In short, story is great but the gimmick is a sham, at least as far I'm concerned.\n\n"", ""\n\n  I had actually read Anansi Boys years ago, ages really, and very much enjoyed it, so I'd always intended to give American Gods a try. With the tv adaptation coming, I got that little extra push to pick it up. Five out of five for the book itself. Great writing. I've always enjoyed Gaiman's work. One out of five stars for paying way too much extra for content I cannot see on ANY of my devices. Not one. I realize my kindle is old, so whatever, but my phone sure isn't. So I settle for a three since I cannot review twice.\n\n"", '\n\n  Religion, superstition, where do gods come from and what happens when we stop believing in them? Do they cease to exist or do they have to get a job? On the surface this book follows Shadow and how he falls in with a group of gods who have seen ""better days"". But it is really discussing the nature of myth and storytelling, evil and sacrifice. This one will stay with me for a long time and it\'s likely one of a very short list that I will reread.\n\n']"

  Eskimo and white culture collide in this national bestselling novel of life in the contemporary Alaskan wilderness: “A magnificently realized story” (New York Times Book Review).  Ordinary Wolves depicts a life different from what any of us has known: Inhuman cold, the taste of rancid salmon shared with shivering sled dogs, hunkering in a sod igloo while blizzards moan overhead. But this is the only world Cutuk Hawcley has ever known. Born and raised in the Arctic, he has learned to provide for himself by hunting, fishing, and trading. And yet, though he idolizes the indigenous hunters who have taught him how to survive, when he travels to the nearby Inupiaq village, he is jeered and pummeled by the native children for being white.   When Cutuk ventures into the society of his own people, two incompatible realities collide, perfectly capturing ""the contrast between the wild world and our ravaging consumer culture”. In a powerful coming of age story, a young man isolated by his past must choose between two worlds, both seemingly bent on rejecting him (Louise Erdrich).  Winner of the Milkweed National Fiction Prize  “As a revelation of the devastation modern America brings to a natural lifestyle, it's a tour de force and may be the best treatment of the Northwest and its people since Jack London's works.”—Publishers Weekly, starred review  Read more  ","['4.0 out of 5 stars', '5.0 out of 5 stars', '5.0 out of 5 stars', '5.0 out of 5 stars']","['\nComing of age near the Arctic Circle\n', '\nKantner Gets It\n', '\nNo Ordinary Book\n', '\nRead this book because\n']","['\n\n  ORDINARY WOLVES opens with an Inupiaq hunter named Enuk stopping in at the igloo home of a six-year-old boy named Cutuk (real name Clayton), who lives with his artist father, Abe, brother Jerry and sister Iris near the Arctic Circle. Their mother had left the family shortly after Cutuk\'s birth. Cutuk idolizes the Eskimo hunter and tries to look like him by pushing down his nose. Cutuk wants to kill a wolf so he can be more like the Eskimo hunters but doesn\'t want to invoke the wrath of his nature-loving father. There isn\'t much plot. We see Cutuk, sometimes called Yellowhair, age to twenty-three. He lives in Anchorage for a time but feels as much an outsider there as he does in Takunak, the Eskimo village a day and half dogsled ride from the igloo. Enuk gets lost and Cutuk goes looking for him; Cutuk tries to win the hand of Dawna, the Eskimo girl he thinks he loves. Perhaps the main thrust of the book is Kantner\'s portrayal of the Eskimos Cutuk encounters when he visits their village. They\'re not exactly ""noble savages."" They hunt wolves with AK-47s; they get drunk on Aqua Net, they bully yellow-haired white boys almost incessantly, imitating kung fu movies, and they commit suicide. Modernization and welfare checks have decimated the aboriginal culture. This can be a hard book to read. It is liberally sprinkled with Eskimo words. Kantner provides a glossary at the front of the book. Kantner overdoes it a bit, making sure there\'s Eskimo terminology on practically every page. Words like ""quaq,"" which means frozen fish and ""arii,"" and expression of hurt or disappointment. They are sometimes unnecessary and destroy the flow of the book, especially during dramatic scenes. Would I recommend this book? Absolutely; the exotic setting alone makes it worthwhile and the Eskimo dialect is hilarious.\n\n', '\n\n  As a longtime resident of arctic Alaska and a professional writer, I have to say that Seth Kantner has captured both the landscape and the people of modern bush Alaska as no other writer of fiction has. Bold words, perhaps, but not hyperbole. The details are gritty, authentic, and unflinching, and the prose from which the narrative is woven is inventive, lyrical, witty, and often flat-out gorgeous. The characters are compelling and feel drawn from life. This is enough to allow the reader to forgive some loose ends in the story line. Few first novels are so accomplished or deserving of recognition--especially coming from an unheralded writer from a small press. Whether you love Alaska, have a taste for literary fiction, or are just a fan of superb prose, you should read this book. Better yet, buy it.\n\n', ""\n\n  Two days now, he's made me late for my government job, this Cutuk Kanter. I should be parked in front of the blue Dell glow. Instead I'm lying on my couch under the south window of my suburban Crotch City house, warming in the Arctic Sun, and reading a True story - a shrew story - about life in the North.Publisher's Weekly says Cutuk's the best since Jack London, which says a mouthful about the sorry state of Northern fiction. This is not Jack London. Not John McPhee. Not, God fobid, James Michener or Peter Jenkins. This is where Jack Kerouac and Nanook lock eyes and walk away together. Don't expect the whole story. This is the cracks between the logs, the vole holes in the floor, the leaks in the sod, the spiders in the corner, the all encompassing entropy so few escape. The tourism people down in Juneau are not going to like it. It's not the prettied-up Alaska they sell to the Princess herds on the freshly washed buses. This is the other Alaska, the Alaska we live in every day after the tourists have disappeared into the sky, after the Eskimo girls have taken off their fancy quspuqs and dancy mukluks and lit up a joint. If you live in Crotch City and this book makes you mad, good. Only don't be mad at Cutuk. He just wrote it all down.What I don't get about this book, though, is why the Wolf on the cover is upside down. It's either the Wolf or the title, one of  um's  upside down. 'Splain that, Cutuk. Nah, let 'em try make it pretty. Whadda they know?Alaska has never had a book like this before. How come it took you so long, Cutuk?\n\n"", '\n\n  it\'s a well-written, unromanticized, fascinating window on life in Alaska, written by someone who knows what it\'s like first-hand.  As an Alaska resident for more than 20 years myself, I can tell you that the details in this novel ring true.The book addresses lots of ""issues"": the disconnect between rural and urban life, the effect of modernization on traditional lifestyles, the moral questions posed by the ""footprint"" we humans leave on the wilderness.  But this isn\'t a book about issues. The author has a good ear for dialogue, and his characters are people the reader comes to care about.  The protagonist, Cutuk, an outsider in rural Alaska because of his race, and a misfit in the city because of his upbringing, is easy to identify with, if you\'ve ever felt yourself on the outside looking in.  His experiences are sometimes heartbreaking, sometimes comic, but always absorbing.As a counterpoint to his account of Cutuk\'s struggle to feel at home in the world, the author gives us short chapters every once in a while that recount the lives of the animals on the land.  In contrast to the sometimes-agonized interiority of modern human life, the animals simply are.  Kantner, a talented wildlife photographer, has an eye that has learned to see the reality, bloody and beautiful, of the Alaskan wilderness.  His words give us a chance to experience that world too, and to remember that human life, loves and conflicts are not the only game in town.  There\'s more going on in the universe than just our own life stories, and this book reminds us to step back and take a broader view.Read this book for a window on a world most people probably won\'t get to experience.  Read it because it will make you ask yourself questions.  Read it because, once you pick it up, you won\'t want to put it down!\n\n']"

  New York Times Bestseller!From Neal Stephenson — who coined the term ""metaverse"" in his 1992 novel Snow Crash — comes a sweeping, prescient new thriller that transports readers to a near-future world in which the greenhouse effect has inexorably resulted in a whirling-dervish troposphere of superstorms, rising sea levels, global flooding, merciless heat waves, and virulent, deadly pandemics.One man – visionary billionaire restaurant chain magnate T. R. Schmidt, Ph.D. – has a Big Idea for reversing global warming, a master plan perhaps best described as “elemental.” But will it work? And just as important, what are the consequences for the planet and all of humanity should it be applied?Ranging from the Texas heartland to the Dutch royal palace in the Hague, from the snow-capped peaks of the Himalayas to the sunbaked Chihuahuan Desert, Termination Shock brings together a disparate group of characters from different cultures and continents who grapple with the real-life repercussions of global warming. Ultimately, it asks the question: Might the cure be worse than the disease?Epic in scope while heartbreakingly human in perspective, Termination Shock sounds a clarion alarm, ponders potential solutions and dire risks, and wraps it all together in an exhilarating, witty, mind-expanding speculative adventure.

It did remind me a lot of the Hunger Games with a mix of the Culling Trials. Very similar with the being chosen to go to a school, different factions with different skills and rich-poor, plus the sister taking over the sibling spot. While it was similar to these books it did have its own bit of world building and different reasons for being trained/going to a school.I think the lore and history of the world was written and explained well. I was just confused about some things they had like using horses but they were still in jeans, used archery and swordsman but then there was something about being able to freeze sperm to keep the population. Just a little confused about the level of technology/the world. However, other than those little things, the history of the war, royal family etc. was pretty interestingWhen it comes to the romance part, some relationships did move quickly, although that could be because some of the story went by fairly quickly. The MM seemed rushed between the guys and I wasn’t really sure how I felt about it going that fast. We shall see how it works out in book 2.I do like the few twists and turns that did occur though. Especially with some dangerous situations and the ending.I would probably rate this a 3.5/5, I think the world building and the story was pretty interesting. Rounding up to a 4 for some twists I enjoyed. I feel like I had a lot of questions and some of the histories of the guy and the quickness of relationships felt rushed. I will continue reading this series because I think the author is a good storyteller and I would like to see where she takes this story.\n\n', ""\n\n  Amazing. Absolutely amazing. I don't want to wait for the next book! I need it NOW. 2022 is too far away.\n\n"", '\n\n  I don’t know how to properly express just how much I absolutely loved this book!! It was like, so many of my favourite things all rolled in to one, but with it’s own unique spin on it! The best way I can describe this book is; if you were to take Mulan and mash it with She’s the Man, then toss in a bit of The Hunger Games and a dash of Divergent, and then give it it’s own dystopian world setting, with amazing characters that will create an epic harem, with a bit of magic and mystery; that’s what this book is!When Raven’s twin brother Roe is chosen to attend Knightwood Academy, it’s an honour no one is allowed to refuse. But Roe is sick and Raven doesn’t believe her brother would survive it. So, she secretly takes his place and since this is an all male school, she pretends to be him. When she’s assigned to live in a dorm room with her unit, which consists of four gorgeous males, hiding her true identity is even tougher than she thought it would be. On top of that, this school is basically survival of the fittest, so she has to learn everything she can to survive.This book captured my attention from the very beginning and I absolutely devoured it! There were twists and turns I didn’t see coming, and I loved the humour sprinkled throughout! I would highly recommend this book and I cannot wait for book 2!!\n\n', ""\n\n  I couldn't put it down once i stated reading, the book pulls you in and you can't stop.

  **THE INSTANT #1 NEW YORK TIMES BESTSELLER**""An unforgettable—and Hollywood-bound—new thriller... A mix of Hitchcockian suspense, Agatha Christie plotting, and Greek tragedy.""—Entertainment WeeklyThe Silent Patient is a shocking psychological thriller of a woman’s act of violence against her husband—and of the therapist obsessed with uncovering her motive.Alicia Berenson’s life is seemingly perfect. A famous painter married to an in-demand fashion photographer, she lives in a grand house with big windows overlooking a park in one of London’s most desirable areas. One evening her husband Gabriel returns home late from a fashion shoot, and Alicia shoots him five times in the face, and then never speaks another word.Alicia’s refusal to talk, or give any kind of explanation, turns a domestic tragedy into something far grander, a mystery that captures the public imagination and casts Alicia into notoriety. The price of her art skyrockets, and she, the silent patient, is hidden away from the tabloids and spotlight at the Grove, a secure forensic unit in North London.Theo Faber is a criminal psychotherapist who has waited a long time for the opportunity to work with Alicia. His determination to get her to talk and unravel the mystery of why she shot her husband takes him down a twisting path into his own motivations—a search for the truth that threatens to consume him....

With so much anticipation built up prior to publication, this raises concerns that the reader may be set up for disappointment. I was riveted to the pages in this well written, compelling and original story, but did not feel that it quite reached the level set by all the pre-advanced publicity. I would categorize it as a psychological mystery heavy on psychiatric overtones.The story of Alice echoes the Ancient Greek tragedy of Alcestis. Alice, a psychiatric patient, incarcerated in the secure facility of the Grove, North London, has been unable or unwilling to utter a word since shooting her husband, Gabriel, five times in the face. Alice was a famous painter and Gabriel a successful fashion designer. They lived in a splendid home and seemed to be devoted to each other and in love. After the shooting more than six years ago, she was found with cuts on her wrist and a painting where she depicted herself as Alcestis, of Greek mythology. She still refuses to speak, and her motivation remains a mystery.  Dr. Theo Faber, a psychotherapist, has followed Alice’s case from afar over the years. He succeeds in obtaining employment at the Grove where Alice is being held. The Grove may be on its waning days and in danger of closing, but he is obsessed with Alice. In his arrogance, he feels strongly that he is the only one who can help Alice and get her to speak where all previous doctors have failed.  Dr. Faber, himself has undergone psychotherapy, the result of a troubled childhood and now a possible marriage breakdown.Once he is involved with treating Alice, he breaks hospital rules by going against their orders. He sets up interviews outside the hospital with a cousin, her art dealer, her former brother-in-law, a neighbour. He feels that in breaking the hospital’s ethical code it will help him in getting her to speak and resolve the mystery of what motivated her on the fatal night her husband was murdered. He also gets access to her diary containing her thoughts prior to the shooting.  Will Faber succeed in getting Alice to talk? If so, will she relate to him what happened, and could this be the breakthrough resulting in curing his patient’s disturbed mind?  The plot was gripping, fast-paced and original. The twists were surprising and shocking with an astonishing conclusion. Ingenious!\n\n', ""\n\n  In the first 5 minutes of reading, you know the ending.

A bit like 'Gone Girl' in that after one chapter you think 'Ok, I got this...I can see where this is going' and then BAM, there is a twist. Read another chapter and you go 'aHA! I knew it!' but no....you'd be wrong again. Twists and turns with bit of a peek into institutional living. I enjoyed the many references to art and the symbolism of some fictional pieces. The author described them in such a way I wondered if the paintings actually existed. As I was running out of pages to read I wondered how the author was going to 'wrap it up'. It was surprise. I like that...few books surprise me. This one did.\n\n"", ""\n\n  Strongly disliked the fact that almost all characters in the book are horrible grotesque creatures, who attack viciously: eye  poked out with paintbrush, narrator attacked disgustingly and implausible  by different ugly, unrealistic people, huge obese monstrous people, full of hate and the endless accompanying vile language, implausible plot, and more.  There are no shortage of violent novels, films and newscasts with some connection to the real world, this is not one of them. Where is our humanity in this sort of literature? Yes, I know, there are violent, twisted minds out there [just watch the news] however pure cynicism does not advance any cause, in my view. Why wallow in it? (Sorry this is something of a rant. Sure the genre, murder mystery, is not supposed to be about Mother Theresa or Pope Francis, quite, but any i've read have clever, or amusing characters, and some quality writing.)\n\n"", ""\n\n  I have read so many books, at this point it is hard to find something I can't guess the ending to..

The plot twist near the end was one that I didn't see coming at all and it made everything fall into place quite nicely in a way I hadn't expected.\n\n"", ""\n\n  I decided to order this based on recommendations that it was a good suspense read.I found myself quickly interested and the plotline was a good one.In terms of the writing, one thing I appreciated was the lack of superfluous description or fillers. This seems to be quite standard in novels but I felt the author used just enough.Some of the author's own culture was infused into the novel with several Greek references throughout.I enjoyed reading this overall and the direction did surprise me, but the main reveal missed the mark slightly for me unfortunately. There also seemed to be a little plot hole and I was left with a couple of questions. I think this was a great effort by the author but it perhaps lacked the fine tuning and crafting necessary to make it work as well as it could have in the end. Because of this, I have found it a bit difficult to recommend the book to others. Still, if you are looking for a quick read with an interesting plotline and characters, it could be worth picking up.\n\n""]"

I let my sickness, my love, both rule and ruin me. I played my part, eyes wide open, tempting fate until it delivered.There was never going to be an escape.All of us are to blame for what happened. All of us serving our own sentences. We were careless and reckless, thinking our youth made us indestructible, exempt from our sins, and it cost us all.I’m done pretending I didn’t leave the largest part of me between these hills and valleys, between the sea of trees that hold my secrets.It’s the reason I’m back. To make peace with my fate.And if I can’t grieve enough to cure myself in my time here, I’ll remain sick. That will be my curse.But it’s time to confess, to myself more so than any other, that I’d hindered my chances because of the way I was built, and because of the men who built me.At this point, I just want to make peace with who I am, no matter what ending I get.Because I can no longer live a lie.This trilogy is a gritty, modern day take on Robin Hood.

Exploratory teams are accompanied by Company-supplied security androids, for their own safety.But in a society where contracts are awarded to the lowest bidder, safety isn’t a primary concern.On a distant planet, a team of scientists are conducting surface tests, shadowed by their Company-supplied ‘droid — a self-aware SecUnit that has hacked its own governor module, and refers to itself (though never out loud) as “Murderbot.” Scornful of humans, all it really wants is to be left alone long enough to figure out who it is.But when a neighboring mission goes dark, it's up to the scientists and their Murderbot to get to the truth.At the Publisher's request, this title is being sold without Digital Rights Management Software (DRM) applied.

That is to say, Martha Wells seems like a very talented writer (this, I think, is the first of her work I have read) but the science fiction parts are nothing particularly new.  In fact, they remind me of classic sci-fi from at least half a century ago.  My only complaint (and this is not just an issue for Wells) is that, however it is that a computer intelligence (or computer enhanced intelligence) would process what we think of as television, it would not be in anything like real time.  I am not sure how a seemingly conscious computer would describe extracting the information from zeros and ones but it would not be in hours of content.  Maybe it would just know as soon as the content was in memory.  Does my iPhone “watch” an episode of “Brooklyn 99” as soon as I download it to memory? Certainly, if Siri had such capacity, she could tell me everything about that episode without taking time to watch it (including details that no human viewer would ever bother to process).  Everything would be available to her in something akin to an instant from my point of view and she would know minute details like how many coffee cups were on the break room table in scene three or whether Scully’s shirt was missing a button.Which is a long way of ranting about a small problem: except that it kept bothering me.  Particularly because Murderbot mentions how much better at processing than humans he is and uses his connectivity to view things from the perspective of cameras rather than his own eyes.  If an author is going to the trouble to think about that kind of thing then I feel like she should also think about how Murderbot would consume entertainment.I will be reading more of the series though.  It is light science fiction but it is also very good science fiction.[NL]\n\n', '\n\n  “You don’t need to look at me. I’m not a sexbot.”Often times, a choice is an illusion presented to the protagonist in cyberpunk. By way of, typically, some sort of omnipresence; an A.I, an authority figure, sometimes societal structure itself. This is only one reason why All Systems Red is important to the sub-genre and what makes it slightly difficult to classify.In this short and sweet novella, we follow Murderbot. A SecUnit (Security Unit) tasked with safeguarding a team of humans who go on a mission to another planet. Unbeknownst to them, Murderbot has a hacked ""governor"" module; cyberware that makes them compliant.In this future Androids have cloned human flesh as well as cybernetic implants (and other non-organic parts). These \'droids are used as disposable labor in a myriad of ways, from sexbots to SecUnits like Murderbot. Interestingly,  Murderbot is the closest thing to a name it has and it is assigned by it, not given.The Company must provide these \'droids to protect their interests at all times. After all, they do have insurance. Part of their ability to do so is through their use of this governor module, which forces commands to the \'droid. That would have been the illusion of choice typical of cyberpunk. Ostensibly, the droids don\'t know they don\'t have free will until this module is hacked or removed. Murderbot outright refuses commands, not often, but it is integral to the story as it unfolds; literally from the first page to last.""It’s wrong to think of a construct as half bot, half human. It makes it sound like the halves are discrete, like the bot half should want to obey orders and do its job and the human half should want to protect itself and get the hell out of here. As opposed to the reality, which was that I was one whole confused entity, with no idea what I wanted to do. What I should do. What I needed to do.""Also of note is that although it is a \'droid, it is also an obsessive consumer when it comes to one thing: soap operas. We learn it also finds ""real"" humans boring and often tedious. So then, to be autonomous is to also be a consumer; you can\'t have it both ways in this future. A small, elegant thing about this fiction. Either Murderbot is compliant with the system or it depends on it. All Murderbot wants to do is consume this entertainment. While old cyberpunk is technophobic, generally; and new cyberpunk is often verging on solarpunk in its hopefulness. I love that Martha Well\'s take on technology could be seen as a subversion of cyberpunk and a much more nuanced take on how the genre can explore technology today.""I hate having emotions about reality; I’d much rather have them about Sanctuary Moon.""Also, this is the first cyberpunk novel I\'ve read with no pronouns given to something autonomous and a protagonist, and it works exceedingly well. While the crew attempts to anthropomorphize Murderbot... it does not think of itself as human; often displaying the amount of social skills one might expect from something that just wants to put the world on mute and turn up the volume on entertainment. But while attempting to be almost performative in not being human, it manages to be more human than it realizes, embodying some of the social changes we have seen with the meteoric rise in people using social media and technology in every facet of their daily lives.""This was what everything had always told me I was supposed to want. Supposed to want.""In short order the author has managed to supplant a predominate trope with a more nuanced take; use no pronouns for the protagonist in a very natural way that doesn\'t break up the flow of the text at all (a feat itself); display a much better take on technology in line with the themes at work; and still maintain the point of the illusion of choice trope. We are all bots and we are all humans because of the way we interface with capitalism in this day and age. We all have a choice... but what good is it? This is what is being examined in the book. Because of these subversive elements, I am inclined to label it as post-cyberpunk, struggling against the normal conventions of the sub-genre.Also, its name is Murderbot for a reason. There\'s a lot going on with this character for such a short novella and you should read it. One of the best endings to a book I\'ve ever read. 5/5You can buy All Systems Red, the first in a series of novellas featuring Murderbot as the protagonist, here.""What was I supposed to do, kill all humans because the ones in charge of constructs in the company were callous? Granted, I liked the imaginary people on the entertainment feed way more than I liked real ones, but you can’t have one without the other.""\n\n', '\n\n  WHAT is Murderboy?  An androd construct having both cloned organic and mechanical components - think of a Terminator that looks more like RoboCop, right down to the integral weapons systems.  WHO is Murderbot?  A painfully shy intelligence who finds all human interactions to be profoundly uncomfortable, who just wants to be left alone, yet who is tasked with the physical protection of a group of scientists exploring a planet.  It\'s a good thing Murderbot takes its job seriously...well, kind of seriously.All of the good reviews for this novella are well-deserved.  In Murderbot, Martha Wells has created a fascinating character who\'s surprisingly nuanced and situated him in a futuristic universe that\'s nevertheless all too recognizable.  A universe of violence, corporate greed, mercenary predation, and prejudice.  Some of that might sound a little ""woke"", but Wells keeps things well grounded.  And besides, I was just too busy trying to understand Murderbot!A solid five stars.\n\n', ""\n\n  Hired security for an outer-planet survey team, socially awkward Murderbot would rather engage in melodramatic entertainment then deal with humans, until major evil-doers force Murderbot to step-up, unwillingly of course.It was a light, fast read for my first Sci-Fi book. Gave it 3 stars because I felt it ended quite abruptly.Note: It's a trilogy, forcing you to find out more in the next book.\n\n""]"

She also must participate in a weekend event called Christmas camp where she will interact with select fans to get ideas for her new book. The problem is, Riley has not celebrated Christmas since her father died when she was eight years old. When Riley does a live interview to promote her new book, she is caught off guard by a question and announces that she had the love of her life but is now single. Who is that great love that Riley let slip through her fingers? Can Riley fool her fans and the family that owns the lodge where she is holding her event and make them believe she is Miss Christmas?Luke is helping his mother out at his family’s lodge holding an event called Christmas Camp. He is everything Christmas and he thinks this is just the publicity they need to sell the lodge, that is until he meets the author that is holding the event. He does not trust that she will not run out on the guests and the event like she did in her live interview. When three ex boyfriends of Riley’s make reservations to surprise her, can Luke pull off this event and deal with Riley Reynolds and her ex boyfriends for an entire weekend?Luke and Riley must rely on each other to make this event a success. Things seem to be going smoothly until Riley sees her ex boyfriends, all believing they were “the one that got away”. How can Riley choose just one man?This was just the sweetest story of someone who rediscovers the magic of Christmas. I loved Karen Schaler’s writing style and I am excited to read her other novels. The premise for the book was unique and oh so much fun. It added such an interesting twist into the story as the reader tries to figure out which man Riley will choose. The characters were loveable and Comet the dog was just the cutest addition to the story. Thank you so much to the author Karen Schaler, HawkTale Publishing and NetGalley for an advanced copy of the book to review. It was fabulous! All opinions expressed for this review are unbiased and entirely my own.\n\n', '\n\n  Have you ever heard of a Christmas Camp?  It’s a total immersion into the holiday season for guests enrolled in the “camp” (it’s usually a warm inviting Inn). Having written two previous books in the Christmas camp series, Karen Schaler brings us to a new holiday destination full of all the Christmas joy we’ve come to expect.Riley Reynolds is a journalist turned romance writer.  She’s had success with several books already and has quite a fan base.  Unfortunately, her last romance novel was lacking the romance - likely indicative of a challenged love life.  Now she is faced with a task of writing a Christmas novel: a very difficult challenge given that she has not celebrated the holiday since she was eight years due to the death of her father.  As a publicity stunt, Riley has been instructed to host a Christmas Camp at the Inn run by her publicist’s friend Luke who needs the media attention in order to sell the Inn.  The guests of the camp are there because they are fans of her books. Riley reluctantly agrees - she really has no choice since her publisher demands it.  What she doesn’t know is that three of her longer term boyfriends will also be there, each trying to charm Riley back into their lives.  Will Riley find the inspiration for her new book at Christmas Camp?I really enjoyed this book.  It’s full of Christmas goodness with all the hot chocolate, cookies, and romance one comes to expect from a holiday book. Riley’s character is well-developed and it’s wonderful to watch her grow from a woman trying to ignore the holiday due to personal loss, to someone embracing it and ready to make new memories. I loved all the Christmas activities and the fact the author highlights green initiatives and community good will in this book.  As one would expect, the book is somewhat predictable but I’m perfectly fine with this.  In this world full of chaos, at least I can count on the predictability of a great holiday book.Thanks to Netgalley and Hawktale Publishing for the ARC of this book in exchange for the honest review provided here.\n\n', ""\n\n  This was such a cute holiday read that has the potential to be my favourite read of the season!Beyond anything else, this novel has the most amazing setting which created the perfect atmosphere for a winter holiday read. In all honesty, that's only one small reason why I loved this book so much but I think it's the biggest reason for me. This story (and the setting) gave me all of the warmhearted feelings of winter and reminded me why I love the season.I was nervous when the novel introduced a storyline similar to The Bachelorette but the drama involved did keep the novel entertaining. I will say though that this storyline (along with the three additional characters) was not my favourite part of the story but my enjoyment of the rest of the novel more than made up for it.If you like a Hallmark movie, if you like a cheesy holiday romance, or if you just need something to get you into the spirit of the holidays...check this book out. From start to finish, this story filled me such warmth and had me smiling throughout.***Thank you to HawkTale Publishing for providing me with an e-ARC in exchange for an honest review.***\n\n""]"

Now he arrived at the castle to hear of hauntings and cults and to be drawn to the portrait of beautiful Joanna MacInnes, who died here amid a furnace of flame. And looking at her, Gavin desired her, feeling an impossible longing to take her in his arms.OR TO BURN...The real Joanna MacInnes had escaped the fire that claimed her kin. For months she has walked Ironcross by night, hiding in its secret passageways, searching for the truth behind the castle's curse. Now she feared it would claim Gavin Kerr.

And even as her lips opened beneath his, she knew time was running out before they faced a heartless villain...a terrifying secret...and a struggle between eternal darkness and the power of undying love.

It is important to read the prequel as well as the first book in the series prior to reading this one. Please note that this book does contain a number of trigger warnings. This is a dark romance story.The second book picks up where the first book left off. I do not want to give too much away for those that have not read the other books; however, be prepared. If you thought that the first book had a lot of mystery and lingering questions, it has nothing on the second book. This book will take you on an emotional roller coaster ride. I enjoyed the suspense element to the book. I found that I don’t read a lot of romantic suspense and Tracy did a really good job at keeping me on the edge of my seat.I’m enjoying this story overall and I thought that this book was a great addition to the series. This book does end with a cliffhanger which I assumed going into the book. I was blown away with the surprise ending though. Even though you know with some authors going into a series that it’s going to end on a cliffhanger…especially if you’re read any of Tracy’s other series...I was still shocked. She gets me every single time!I was provided an advanced reader copy in exchange for an honest review.\n\n', '\n\n  I’m not even sure how to write how I feel about this book. I love the banter between Seb and Stella.Stella runs shortly as soon as she can and heads back to her friends. They help her heal physically while giving her the break she needs to get back on her feet so she can head back to London stronger than ever. Stella isn’t sure if she can trust Seb; he has said too many things to make her believe that he has her best interests at heart.“Don’t even think about it, Hellion,” a familiar deep voice rumbles in my ear as I lift my foot from the floor, ready to slam the heel of my boot into his foot.I just loved this book and didn’t want it to end, especially the way it ended. I can not wait for the third and final book for Stella and Seb.I have received a free copy of this book for an honest review.\n\n', '\n\n  Well, I have to say that this book is only meant for those of us who LOVE drama and women who aren’t pushovers. This series is also for those who can handle cliffhangers because let me tell you these first two books in the Knight’s Ridge Empire series’ endings were jaw dropping.We follow along with mafia princess, Stella, and Seb’s story which all began in Wicked Knight. This second book answered some questions but believe me there are many more left to answer.Make sure you grab Wicked Knight first and get your reading on because this book will keep you on the edge of your seat and anxiously waiting for Wicked Empire which is to follow.\n\n', '\n\n  This is my favorite series of the year. Tracy Lorraine has out done herself with The start of her Knight’s Ridge series. Stella is such a kick butt heroine. I love all the things about her. She is so strong, Independant and doesn’t hold back. Seb is just perfection all around. These two are my fave, fave, fave book couple to date and I have many but they take the top spot. Don’t take my word for it or do, but for real this is a must read! Like, 1-click this baby today! It’s worth the ride! Woohoo!\n\n', '\n\n  This story continues to be extremely thrilling, suspenseful, angst filled and definitely spicy. It’s dark, twisted and will have your emotions all over the place. It kept me gripping my kindle tightly and on the edge of my seat not knowing what was going to happen with the next turn of the page.Hang on tightly because this part of the story is one hell of a ride and it will shock you to the core.\n\n', ""\n\n  I was given an advance readers copy of this book and have decided to write a voluntary honest review. I can't get enough of Seb and Stella. The Hate, the toxic energy they give off is freaken hot I can't stop reading.

  They hurt me, abuse me, use me…I signed up for it. Literally. I agreed to the contract that made me the Lords’ Lady, a position that requires me to do whatever they want, but only as protection from someone worse. I agreed to be in their beds, on my knees, and punished should I disobey.I just wasn’t expecting punishment like this.Killian is two-hundred-and-twenty pounds of muscle, brutal physicality, and pure spite. He thinks I don’t know that he watches me when I sleep.Tristian is fair-haired and charming to anyone who doesn’t know better. To me, he’s the man who seeks to control me, with his cold eyes and possessiveness.Rath is the dark-eyed tempest who took me into his bed. Even having been subjected to his barbed tongue, he’s the first man to ever make me feel safe.I hadn’t realized how much they’ve worn me down and made me feel complacent, but it turns out they’ve messed with my head just as much as they abused my body. Despite the awful things they've done to me, they actually made me feel special. Cared for. Protected.And then I found out it was all a lie.The way Tristian cares, Killian’s vigilant eyes, and worst of all, my contented moments in Rath’s bed, were all part of a game.A game to see who can use me best.  A game they’ve been playing since day one.And now?It’s a game I’m going to win.WARNING: This book is a DARK/BULLY romance.

It really does make you think of acceptable and unacceptable things within a relationship. You obviously understand the betrayal that Story goes through, especially after the first book. Your follow her journey as she tries to come to terms with everything. Then you are given twists and turns and a lot of your perceptions start to change as the book goes on. A lot of what I was thinking during book one changed but some did stay the same.I like that we started to learn more about this world, both in and around the University. We are introduced to different characters, different layers within the world and new drama as well as previous drama. This book didn’t end on a cliffhanger but it left you wanting more. The conclusion of the trilogy will be great. I’m hoping that this author duo will do some spinoffs within this world. Especially since we did learn what some of the houses do and I think knowing some of their traditions and some other stories will be interesting.\n\n', '\n\n  Okay, I was excited about this book, the first one was excellent, BUT on some level I was very disappointed with this one.  After all the serious abuse (I had to skip over a key scene, it was so awful) our MFC is staying with the 3 scumbags.  I’m not really sure if I’ll continue to book 3.  If it has a HEA that would be a ridiculous end to this trilogy.  These are not nice people,  and one broken girl is not going to be able to fix them and herself with everyone living a good life.\n\n', '\n\n  THE REVIEW FOR THE BOOK: Lords of WrathGENRE: Dark reverse harem romanceAUTHOR: Angel Lawson & Samantha RueTROPE: contemporary romance, dark romance, reverse harem, step-brother, taboo, bully romanceTYPE: The Royals of Forsyth University #2POV: Multiple POVMY RATING: 5.0 StarsThis novel picks up shortly after the conclusion of the first book. Story is living as the Lady to Killian (her step-brother), Tristian and Rath who are the Lords of Forsyth University. With Story’s stalker Ted on the rampage, she devises a plan to kill two birds with one stone. Get revenge on the Lords by having Ted turn on them in retaliation for taking something away from him.I loved the first book in this series for its unique story line. All the popular frats at the university have some type of Royal title. For Killian, Tristian and Rath…they are the Lords and story is their Lady. The first book was very much a game to see who could get the most points with Story and her virginity. The second book we see Story take some of her power back and show the Lords that she’s not a push over. We also see her embrace her inner Lady and challenge the men. We get to witness the three men open up in a way that they may never have before. The Lords can think that this is all a game and that Story is nothing, but she changes them. I found this book to be much darker than the first book. Some of the most troubling things actually came about because of Story and not the three Lords. I was very emotional while reading the last 30% of the book. I wouldn’t say that I was bawling but there were definitely tears. This book is an emotional roller coaster but oh so good. I can’t tell you enough how much I love this book. I loved how this book ended as well. There is so much more to the story that it setup the third book really well. However, it felt like there was a bit of closure in other ways. The ending was the turning point in the relationship between Story and the three Lords.If you’re a fan of dark reverse harem romance, then you’re going to love this book. This book is a part of a series and cannot be read as a standalone. Check out the first book in the series and then read this one. It will not disappoint.\n\n', '\n\n  This exceeded my expectations.This was warped, twisted, dark and spicy AF. Which is entirely up my alley, so obviously I loved it.Fair warning.. it has TONS of triggers - so if you\'re easily triggered then this book is definitely not for you.I loved that we picked right up where we left off with the Lords and Story - and hell YES does this girl have a backbone. SHE is damn right Savage and rightfully so, she has been through SO much and Story has finally hit her breaking point.I feel like we learnt SO much more in this book than we did in book 1, but we still have all the loose ends to tie up in terms of Ted and Daniel.The boys are finally turning into more than just ""Lords"" the readers are finding out what makes them the way they are. And really, what it comes down to, is that they are hurt, broken young men who instead of spiraling, have used that hurt to turn them into beasts. They exert dominance and control because they are afraid of being hurt.So yeah- safe to say I LOVED this. Can\'t wait for book 3!\n\n', ""\n\n  Lords of Wrath amped up the dark and dirty, if that was even possible. The whole story continued to build in intensity, in intrigue and steam.Book 2 was definitely darker with heavier content to me. The trigger warnings are not a joke. I was definitely not upset by anything in the book. I enjoyed the more emotional elements that showed that Story wasn't just a naïve girl. This book gave a better picture of her for me. It made me like her and other characters even more. Since the book is multi POV, it also made me fall in love with one of the guys.The story is so well written that it drew me in and I could not put it down. Who needs sleep when you have the Lords?!\n\n"", '\n\n  I fell in love with the characters in book 1, but that’s nothing compared to how I feel in book 2.  So much more was opened about Story, Dimitri, Killian, Tristian and even Ms. Crane!  The story goes deeper, darker, hotter and you enjoy every single inch you’re pushed into taking.  Lessons are learned by every single character in this book, and I’m talking more than just The Lords and Lady, some go up in smoke, some are, well….they’re splattered everywhere, but one thing’s for sure, the deeper you dig to hide the truth, the harder it is get out of that grave you’ve dug for yourself.Thank you Angel Lawson and Samantha Rue for bringing these characters to life through your words and our imagination.  Can’t wait for book 3!\n\n']"

  I'm in love with three men. I'm just not sure if they're a dream come true or my worst nightmare.It began with hearing voices - another step on my steady descent into madness. It was inevitable, considering the whole town hated me and I was the loneliest person on the planet.I didn't really blame them. Everyone who got close to me ended up in the hospital. I'd be suspicious of me too.When the three distinct, alluring voices in my head started to appear before my eyes as three distinct, gorgeous men I really started to question everything I thought I knew.They called themselves Dreamwalkers and told me they were hunting the monster attacking all the people around me.They won't leave me alone.I'm not sure I want them to.But am I the monster they're after? Or are we all in worse danger than I ever could've imagined? If you like your romance with a bit of suspense, unique paranormal world building, and a whole lot of spice, you're going to LOVE Reverie and Redemption!

Reverie and Redemption is a paranormal reverse harem romance. If you like unusual paranormal stories, with sweet and hot men, strong character building, and a tough and deep main female character, I highly recommend this book.This is from an author I really like, and she didn't disappoint yet again. There were heart wrenching moments and the loneliness trope that gets me everytime. It was so well written that it got me deeply invested in the story.I loved the light, funny and solid dynamic between the three men, the humor, the perfect amount of vulnerability and fierceness, the unique paranormal aspects, and the well written spice.Also, the fact that the nickname trope that we see everywhere in RH stories wasn't as forced in this story but just sprinkled here and there was really refreshing.The story progression was well written, it flowed and had a nice pace.The story is about a woman who has been having intense sleep walking episodes since the age of 11 and, everytime she wakes up from them, someone close to her is found in a deep and inexplicable coma. The story starts with one of those episodes, where she wakes up in the middle of the woods and starts hearing voices.Overall, this book was great, and I'd like even more of this world. I feel we only touched the top of the iceberg with the potential it brings. Please give us more Kaydence Snow!

This story captured my attention from the very beginning and I devoured the whole thing! I just couldn’t put it down!Over the years, everyone Reverie has ever loved or even remotely cared about has suddenly and suspiciously slipped into a mysterious coma and often times they don’t wake up. Reverie doesn’t know why, but she’s positive it’s somehow connected to her. She’s become the town pariah, and doesn’t even try to get close to anyone anymore for fear that they too will suffer the consequences.When Reverie starts hearing voices she thinks she’s really starting to lose it. When she starts seeing the hot guys those voices belong to, she thinks she’s gone mad. But when these guys explain that they’re Dreamealkers and want to help Reverie, she starts to believe that maybe she’s not crazy and perhaps she really isn’t responsible for the strange things happening to the people she loves and cares for.I thought this whole story was such a neat and original concept! I loved the different  characters and their backgrounds and I loved Reverie’s quick-witted and sarcastic personality!

Virtually every character is stubborn and all the women think men are stupid and all the men think that women are stupid or unfathomable. It reminds me of the Flintstones. The plot is great but the characters are straight out of the old stereotypical war of the sexes. There aren't many incidences of intimacy and far too many instances of men and women being angry with each other. The characters are two dimensional and boring. Jordan describes the necklines of every woman who appears in the story with plunging necklines being euphemisms for sex appeal. The characters are not very realistic. They are not very human. Fantasy novels are notorious for characters that are not well developed or complex or sensitive but the Jordan's characters are amongst the worst I have encountered reading fantasy.\n\n"", ""\n\n  The Dragon Reborn starts with the consequences of Rand's battle against The Dark One. Heavily troubled with doubt, he must prove to himself that he really is the one people are clamoring for, and there is only one way to truly leave no space for question: claim Callandor. With this premise, I expected to spend a lot of time reading about his journey of self-acceptance, instead what I got were a lot Egwene, Perrin, and Mat. That is not exactly a bad thing as those characters were in need of further development, especially Mat, but it was still disappointing to only read Rand's perspective once every twenty or so chapters.Mat Cauthon is undoubtedly the most entertaining character to read. Mat and Thom together? I could not ask for more. the lighthearted trickster that he is, even while passing an aura of unreliability, will stop at nothing to help those he cares about and keep his word. The duo provides an atmosphere of joy that counterbalances the struggles and seriousness of the task the other main characters must complete in the book, always making sure the pacing of the story does not remain overly dark for too long.Finally, one of my major gripes with Perrin was given a new light, and his reluctance to accept his ability to communicate with wolves was understandable given the newfound potential consequences. In the two previous books, I thought his denial was shallow and unfounded. He can talk with wolves and his eyes are golden, not a big deal compared with what Rand and Mat are going through. In The Dragon Reborn, however, we are presented with the dire consequence of fully embracing that gift that might as well be a curse if used without caution. This makes his struggle and fear to be exponentially more relatable and believable, and the times he must use his power to help their cause are given more meaningful tension. He must learn to use his gifts to survive, but he does not dare to fully accept them and their consequences.I will not lie, I had to strengthen my will to read Egwene's chapters, and I found myself uninterested more often than not when I realized a switch to her perspective was incoming. She was snappish and bratty for the most part of the book, her struggles always feeling less important to what the other characters were going through. I'm glad her chapters always had the company of Nynaeve and Elayne to make them more enjoyable.The book concludes in a lighter tone than the previous one, setting up plotlines that promise to develop more characters besides Rand. There are doubts nuanced and sprinkled in the previous books that get pondered upon in this one, their answers terrifying enough to make the characters sure the danger of their journey has only begun. Once again a great book, if a bit unbalanced with less of the Dragon's perspective than the title would otherwise suggest. It was great seeing all the character development of Perrin, Mat, Nynaeve, and even Egwene—this makes me hope I'll eventually enjoy reading about her.\n\n"", '\n\n  Fantastic follow up.  An ever peaking sense of adventure that manages to take unexpected turns when ever the reader begins to think they know what should happen next. It stands out as not only doing a good job of further developing characters but showing that these adventurers can remain interesting no matter which additional  character they get paired with. Another great step forward for the wheel.\n\n', ""\n\n  This series of soft covers are good enough but the cover art pales in comparison to previous efforts. Also there's a lot of text fade throughout. Some pages can be quite hard to read due to this.\n\n"", ""\n\n  My husband has been missing this book from the series as long as I've known him, ordered, arrived quickly and in beautiful condition, it now completes his set and matches the rest on the bookshelves like it's always been there!!

Slurs against people with disabilities were used. I don\'t mind swearing, in fact I like it over cheesey substitutes but this character could barely form a sentence without the f-word. The logic in the story felt really strange. This girl is wanted dead, beaten relentlessly by people in school. She tries to follow their advice and leave, and is punished for it? I get that this Alpha of the pack is possessive, but theres nothing really bonding her to him until she shifts. A few more things that bothered me was there\'s a huge conversation on ""controlling the wolf"" and yet no one seems to follow the world building. After shifting, our main character remembers everything and not only that but other characters around her seem to know this as well? As someone who is roughly the same age as the main character, I found her more like a 14yr old. Anytime a pun is used, the exact phrase of ""Yeah, I went there"" is said.

  For centuries, the inlet called the Golden Horn and the city on the hills overlooking it were situated in the middle of the known world. To the south, through the Dardanelles and the Aegean Sea, lay the Mediterranean, around which the Greek, Roman, Persian, and Arab worlds revolved. To the north, through the Bosporus, lay the Black Sea, with its Russian and eastern European coastline. And across the narrow Bosporus was Asia Minor, bridge to the Orient. Because of its strategic location, the city on the Golden Horn was coveted by a succession of different peoples. But even though it frequently was under siege, even though control of it often changed hands, and even though, indeed, it was conquered and leveled more than once, the city proved to be virtually immortal.Founded nearly twenty-seven centuries ago as the Greek colony of Byzantium, the city was harassed by the barbaric Thracians, attacked by the Persians, vied for by the Athenians and Spartans. Weakened and dispirited, its citizens finally were forced to seek the protection of Rome, and the city became little more than a Roman outpost. Then, in the fourth century, the Roman Emperor Constantine I decided to build his capital on the site. It was in the new city of Constantinople that ancient Greco-Roman culture was married to Eastern Orthodox Christianity and that Western civilization became Christian civilization. As the center of the vast Byzantine Empire, the city was one of the richest and most important on earth. But because of its wealth, it was sacked by the Crusaders in 1204. And because of its strategic location, it was conquered by the Ottoman Turks in 1453.Since then, as the city of Istanbul, it has remained an international metropolis, a city of East and West, a city whose great paintings, mosaics, statuary, and architecture reflect the many cultures that have been centered there and the many ages the city has survived.

It should be a great vehicle for story but somehow it never quite gels. Nazi sympathizers and right-wing hooligans get tied into the plot. It\'s a red-herring in the story and feels tacked on. The novel doesn\'t flow like the best of Child\'s work which work best when Reacher is intrigued by a small occurrence that he feels impelled to follow. Reacher is, as always, the reluctant defendant of the little guy but it all seems too mechanical and written by numbers. A shame. Not a good first outing for his collaboration with his son Andrew. I enjoyed it but not nearly so much as other Reacher novels.\n\n', ""\n\n  I have been a Jack Reacher fan for many years. However, the last three or four installments have been incredibly disappointing. Lee Child was just phoning it in, it was hackneyed and boring. I really thought I would not read anymore Jack Reacher after skipping through at least 50% the last time.But Child has a new co-author, thank god. Not so many boring, repetitive, ten page descriptions of Reacher (who must be at least in his 50s by now, and apparently never works out or practises his fighting or other skills in any way) fighting and crippling eight healthy strong young football players/thugs at a time.Jack Reacher once again puts his clothes under the mattress to iron them. Has a very acute sense of time. Changes his clothes. Has an internal dialogue going. Interacts with others.I think the best part was the  two women who are as big contributors to the resolution of the situation as Reacher himself. And we were spared the cliché of reacher having a sexual involvement with either of them. Well, almost spared, there was a third woman that he hooks up with at the end.Which brings to mind… Maybe Reacher has some unknown progeny? Who might be pretty much grown up? Maybe somehow his path across with the son he hasn't met yet?Just one thing though. I do not believe that Jack reacher knows off by heart the birthdays of Lenin, Stalin, Hitler, Trotsky etc. Also, it seems a bit silly at this point to have reacher be so anti-computer.In my opinion, the new author has injected new life into the character and the series. I look forward to the next one..\n\n"", ""\n\n  I have read the entire Jack Reacher series and find that Jack is slightly different in this book, nothing I could really articulate, but there is a feeling that something has happened to him.  Some of the things that happened in this book seemed to stretch his credibility as well.  He seemed almost to have developed ESP and could predict the future happenings in a way that just didn't ring true.  That being said, I still enjoyed the read enough to give it 4 stars.\n\n"", '\n\n  I have read every Jack Reacher book written by Mr Child and I have enjoyed every book. The decisive, no nonsense approach the character Reacher uses to decide right and wrong and his will to set things right no matter what. In this book I found the language surrounding Reachers decision making process has been softened. In fairness the character Reacher is aging, his retirement from the military has increased but he is an individual of a certain age wherein technology eludes him; like many of us. The story subject matter in The Sentinel is timely given the United States elections of 2016 and 2020 and certainly provides food for thought.\n\n', ""\n\n  I recognized the real Jack Reacher in the first and last chapters. All the rest seems like filling up, it took an eternity to find the missing computers, Jack Reacher is now having claustrophobia problems, a guy that flew in planes all his life. He always had small problems using the new technology, now they are huge problems. As Jack Reacher is getting old fast and in the wrong direction, Lee Child should now write prequels when Reacher was in the army or in the early years after he quit. His big books were in these periods.This book surely won't make me try to read his brother's books because it is badly written.I didn't read it in three days like I did with many of his early books, took me a whole week and I almost put it aside once.\n\n""]"

She's clear about what she wants and she may wish to be invisible sometimes but that's more a product of her past more than anything. She has real challenges to overcome and while I don't want to spill all the details it's definitely not one I saw coming. It really added to her character development. Over the story she confronts her fears and she finds a stronger version of herself for it.Once these two finally get it on, it's so sexy and loving. Wolfe has a caring side that he didn't even realize he had and it's so sweet when he's always there to help Rebel even when she's spitting mad.

Did she hold up grades yes, did she still try to find normal when she did not not what normal was ? YES.. she is one of the very few who still wanted more and knew maybe there was more when she did not understand!

Her ingenious, creations captivated viewers and intrigued all but one of the judges, Dominic De Vere. When Sylvie's unicorn cake went spectacularly sideways, Dominic was quick to vote her off the show. Since then, Sylvie has used her fame to fulfill her dream of opening a bakery. The toast of Instagram, Sugar Fair has captured the attention of the Operation Cake producers…and a princess.Set…Dominic is His Majesty the King’s favorite baker and a veritable British institution. He’s brilliant, talented, hard-working. And an icy, starchy grouch. Learning that Sylvie will be joining him on the Operation Cake judging panel is enough to make the famously dour baker even more grim. Her fantastical baking is only slightly more troublesome than the fact that he can’t stop thinking about her pink-streaked hair and irrepressible dimple.Match…When Dominic and Sylvie learn they will be fighting for the once in a lifetime opportunity to bake a cake for the upcoming wedding of Princess Rose, the flour begins to fly as they fight to come out on top.The bride adores Sylvie’s quirky style. The palace wants Dominic’s classic perfection.In this royal battle, can there be room for two?

Which just goes to show you how much I love her books because so many of them are so great. But it’s easily the one that made me cry the most.This story is doing a lot plot-wise, which may actually be what works against it a little bit, only because sometimes certain elements don’t quite get the full attention they deserve, or are tied-off pretty quickly and conveniently, but despite all that, I enjoyed everything that was done. And was also, like, moved by much of it; see aforementioned tears.The obvious plot points to note are easily deduced by both cover and summary; there’s a pair of rival grumpy/sunshine bakers who feature not only on a GBBO-like baking competition but also are competing to win the royal wedding cake contract. But what’s less obvious? Is the lovely infusion of found family dynamics. As well as complicated biological-family relations. Less lovely but just as emotional? The talk and processing of loss and grief.Like many romances these days, we’re getting more bang for our buck and within the pages of this cutesy adorable outside is a lot of substance. Which isn’t to say the cutesy adorable ones aren’t just as satisfying. But I definitely picked this up for something joyful and fun and I got that.. and tears. That’s all I mean. And I don’t remotely regret getting more than I wanted. There were plenty of laughs (full out cackles a time or two) and I really enjoyed watching these two opposites fall for each other amongst all the other excitement happening around them. Bonus points because they are a bit older than the typical romance protagonists and, as always, Parker makes the steamy moments steamy and a little silly and all around endearingly real.Though I maybe didn’t come off as strong about my love for this one, I think that’s a combination of having too many top top favourites from the author and also just because this one, despite the emotes, was a bit of a softer touch. A slower, gentler, burn of a story.All that to say : this is a definite recommend. And I can’t wait for the next in the series.\n\n']"

  NATIONAL BESTSELLERNEW YORK TIMES BESTSELLERDestined to become a modern classic in the vein of Guns, Germs, and Steel, Sapiens is a lively, groundbreaking history of humankind told from a unique perspective.      100,000 years ago, at least six species of human inhabited the earth. Today there is just one.      Us. Homo Sapiens.      How did our species succeed in the battle for dominance? Why did our foraging ancestors come together to create cities and kingdoms? How did we come to believe in gods, nations, and human rights; to trust money, books, and laws; and to be enslaved by bureaucracy, timetables, and consumerism? And what will our world be like in the millennia to come?      In Sapiens, Dr. Yuval Noah Harari spans the whole of human history, from the very first humans to walk the earth to the radical -- and sometimes devastating -- breakthroughs of the Cognitive, Agricultural, and Scientific Revolutions. Drawing on insights from biology, anthropology, palaeontology, and economics, he explores how the currents of history have shaped our human societies, the animals and plants around us, and even our personalities. Have we become happier as history has unfolded? Can we ever free our behaviour from the heritage of our ancestors? And what, if anything, can we do to influence the course of the centuries to come?      Bold, wide-ranging and provocative, Sapiens challenges everything we thought we knew about being human: our thoughts, our actions, our power...and our future.

Even by the standard of popular history/science, the quality of this ""introductory history of humankind"" is poor. The book contains facts mixed with the author\'s naive opinions about a broad range of topics disguised as facts.Learning history from Yuval Harari is like relying on Facebook feed as your only source of news, you get hooked by the content easily, albeit it\'s mostly disinformation.\n\n', '\n\n  Bestsellers are based not on the quality of the product but the quality of the promotion. This book makes that abundantly clear. This is the worst book I can recall reading.The hype and first few pages hold out hope for a monumental undertaking. That hope is dashed a few pages after a few pages. It deteriorates into an aimless journey of  ‘theories’ based on unending, mundane examples. It is like a bad movie that you watch to the end waiting for a redeeming feature. It never comes. The author’s ‘humour’ is that rare combination of English humour and historian’s wit. It is not that it is so clever you don’t ‘get’ it, it just isn’t funny.The author seems to ignore a prevalent theory that Neanderthal is Homo sapiens neanderthalensis, a sub-species of homo sapiens sapiens, who interbred with Homo sapiens sapiens, thus making up part of the modern non-African genome. Maybe it was ‘inconvenient’ to his ‘theory.’ It also appears the majority of sapiens are also inconvenient as he ignores all but Western sapiens.Someone who spends that much effort to be politically correct is usually over-compensating? When it does come to the political ‘correctness,’ he refers to the People’s Republic of China as ‘Communist China,’ an incorrect name used by the uninformed and, apparently, bestselling authors. Despite his earlier description of communism and capitalism as economic systems, he concludes they are “social organisations.”This book should not be relegated to a back shelf. It should be relegated to the garbage. That is what it is – garbage.\n\n', ""\n\n  This book starts out as an interesting read. However, the author quickly establishes that he is anti-human and uses confirmation-bias religiously to promote his position. In spite of a tremendous volume of evidence to the contrary, the author ignores this evidence to promote a very anti-sapien (human) prejudice. This book isn't about a brief history of humankind. Rather this book is a demonstration of biased writing. I do not recommend this book.\n\n"", '\n\n  If this was classified as fiction I would give it 3 stars..  The books actually is a very good read and he has lots of facts in there which makes sense. However the conclusion he draws from most of these facts is very biased to his judgement and know-how.\n\n', ""\n\n  Excellent book, well-written, thought out and following the simple questions which lead one forward to finding the truth, instead of finding those 'truths' which fit into one's perceived pigeon hole. Such a variety of 'expertise' in putting together a whole from all the parts which most of us don't really see, and some don't even want to know. Kudos to Yuval on inspiring me to get off my butt and continue reading as i had once done, and to use my grey cells to understand this world in a better light.  Thanks Yuval.\n\n"", ""\n\n  Well written.  Great information.  Sapiens and Homo Deus are among the best books I have ever read.  Many sections I re-read because of the original and interesting perspectives of the author.  And when I had finished reading Sapiens I was sad because there were no more interesting and original ideas to read.  I will definitely re-read both of his books in a few months as one can not absorb all of the insights in one reading.  Harari is a delight to read irrespective of what book he has authored.  And I should say emphatically that his writing is easy to understand, interesting, lacks silly jargon, and the grammar and spelling are impeccable.  Harari's books are a great gift for anyone on your shopping list, including yourself.  I can not say enough positive things about his two books.  A must read.\n\n"", ""\n\n  This book is loose and quick on the facts and science. Maybe the author can back up everything he says with proper sourcing and if asked he would, but within the book, you won't find that. What you have instead is a narrative that builds up nicely, and more importantly very interesting ideas. The ideas explored in this book is what makes it really interesting and a worthwhile read—if anything—just to discuss them later on.\n\n"", '\n\n  The sheer magnitude of history, anthropology, biology, science and politics covered in this book and still captivate and enthrall was amazing. I really enjoyed how easy this book was to read and how this author was to able evoke  multitude of emotions like disgust and fascination.  This writing however is biased.....the description of animal cruelty from agriculture highlighted some very disturbing practices.  However, there are many farms in Canada where animals spend most of their lives where they are treated very well...at least up until  they are sold to feedlots. When he describes empires, he chooses to ignore the cruelty and the destruction caused by them, admiring them instead for their achievements in art, science education and literature etc. He also fails to target the corporate entities and the real economic rulers of the world for their role in creating wars, ecological destruction, mass misleading propaganda and harsh, inhumane systems of government and justice. I have learned a lot from this book.  His idea that we are storytellers and our ability to believe in things we have not seen..to believe in make believe, allows us to cooperate in groups of millions.  This concept explains a lot of the craziness of our world and somehow this rings true to me. This book is worthwhile reading, if only to understand the how there can be so much cruelty in our world. I would have given it 5 stars, had I felt the information was truly accurate and balanced.\n\n']"
