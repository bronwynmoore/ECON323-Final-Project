  From the number-one bestselling author of The Nightingale and The Great Alone comes a powerful American epic about love and heroism and hope, set during the Great Depression, a time when the country was in crisis and at war with itself, when millions were out of work and even the land seemed to have turned against them. “My land tells its story if you listen. The story of our family.”Texas, 1921.  A time of abundance.  The Great War is over, the bounty of the land is plentiful, and America is on the brink of a new and optimistic era.  But for Elsa Wolcott, deemed too old to marry in a time when marriage is a woman’s only option, the future seems bleak.  Until the night she meets Rafe Martinelli and decides to change the direction of her life.  With her reputation in ruin, there is only one respectable choice: marriage to a man she barely knows.By 1934, the world has changed; millions are out of work and drought has devastated the Great Plains. Farmers are fighting to keep their land and their livelihoods as crops fail and water dries up and the earth cracks open.  Dust storms roll relentlessly across the plains.  Everything on the Martinelli farm is dying, including Elsa’s tenuous marriage; each day is a desperate battle against nature and a fight to keep her children alive.In this uncertain and perilous time, Elsa—like so many of her neighbors—must make an agonizing choice: fight for the land she loves or leave it  behind and go west, to California, in search of a better life for her family.The Four Winds is a rich, sweeping novel that stunningly brings to life the Great Depression and the people who lived through it—the harsh realities that divided us as a nation and the enduring battle between the haves and the have-nots.  A testament to hope, resilience, and the strength of the human spirit to survive adversity, The Four Winds is an indelible portrait of America and the American dream, as seen through the eyes of one indomitable woman whose courage and sacrifice will come to define a generation.

It\'s all the same.""\n', '\nPerseverance\n']","['\n\n  I must admit that I am stranger to these type of pedastrian plot driven popular novels.  I loved the quasi historical fiction element of the Dust Bowl migration outling the classist inhumane treatment of migrants in their own  country.  This is despicable and although no where even close to the abomination  of slavery, we do get to see the areas where classism and racism have similarities.My problem with the novel is that is so simplistic. I suppose this author knows her audience and clearly it is not me.The portrayal of the Italian American family alerted me immediately to the many flaws in this novel. Italians living in rural farming communities were not buying imported olive and the other stereotypical Italian foods. This part is just silly. These imported products would not have been readily available.Also, the idea that Italian parents would disown a SON and prefer his ""white"" girlfriend who shows up pregnant, is again very silly. Anyone who knows anything about Italian sons knows that their mothers never reject them in favour of pregnant white girls. The next thing about this is the casting of Italians as another race using expressions of ""dark"" and ""olive skinned.""  Italians are members of the white race and although they were cast as different and discriminated against for their culture, they were still white.As for the ""communist"" labour organizers there is nothing out of the ordinary about this, but it interesting to see reviews about how offensive any reference to communism is to some readers. One must remember this is before the realizations about totalitarian governments were very different than true Marxism.Now for our heroine, she is an OK character. She sacrifices everything for her family and the majority of women understand that deep love of one\'s children that permeates and consumes our lives.Overall, I could not finish this repetitive novel. It seems the author who I see churns these types of books out for her legion of fans, also just rehashes the same chapters over and over. It\'s like each new chapter is just a rewritten summary of the one before it. I was astounded she gets away with this to be honest in her attempt to churn out 400 pages... I must also add that the bedroom  scene near the end where Jack wants the ""lights on"" so he can ""see her"" made me laugh out loud. So hokey.This book is an attempt to write a Harlequin romance version of Grapes of Wrath.\n\n', ""\n\n  I grew up with a Dad who lived through the dirty 30s in Saskatchewan, where there are a lot of similarities in terms of what the dust storms, etc., were like.  Everything described in this book in regard to the weather matches the stories he told me.  I also read the Grapes of Wrath many years ago and this book reminded me of that, in terms of illustrating the despair of the people.  I found this book to be just stunning.  I learned a great deal about the migrant workers in California at the time.  I thought that Elsa was one of the most powerful females I've read in a book in recent memory.  The author did a beautiful job of depicting how Elsa finally found her voice.  Every bit of this book was believable.  Every character was living and breathing and speaking in my mind's eye.  I could hardly put it down and stayed up late last night because I simply had to finish it.  Yes, the subject matter is filled with despair and hopelessness, however, there is a thread of hope and positivity and strength that runs through the whole thing and saves it from being a depressing read.  This is a book I will likely read again and I expect I will find even more depth in each character when I do.\n\n"", ""\n\n  This excellent book about the Dust Bowl and the Great Depression has taken me back to my grandmother's stories about the era. After one year of COVID-19, this book showed me how this period, tragic as it is, pales in comparison to what the greatest generation endured for more than a decade.\n\n"", '\n\n  ""Be Brave... or pretend to be. It\'s all the same.""This is one of my favourite quotes in this inspiring, touching and eloquently written novel by Kristin Hannah.Elsa pretended to be brave her entire life, was quiet and at times subdued, until she was faced with her children\'s survival, and their future. Then she realized that she was brave.I gave this novel 4 stars, although it touched me deeply, and I did shed multiple tears throughout the time it took me to read it. It was a depressing tale, that during these dire times today, made me feel the ultimate sadness; for the people during the depression, for the Oakies, and for those during today\'s epic tales of struggle and despair.""Hope has taught me to stand up and find my woman\'s voice even in this mans world.""Elsa\'s character was always afraid to step out of her comfort zone, to do the inexplicable and to live and love a mundane life because that was all she knew, or that she thought she knew.She is a character to be admired, and unlike any character that I have known Hannah to write. She depicted Elsa as a true heroine in every sense of the word, her struggles with being a wife, being a mother, and being a woman were written in such a way that you were sentenced to sit back and reflect on your own struggles.As usual the imagery associated with Hannah\'s writing was second to none, as was her character definition, because every character in this novel is ultimately unforgettable.Another great one from Kristin Hannah.Thank you for writing this novel.\n\n', '\n\n  Someone on Good Reads suggested this was their favorite book, I must admit it wasn’t my favorite , nor was it her best in my opinion. I believe books come to us when we need them and had I read this during a different time in my life it might have meant more to me. That being said, it was well written and taught us about a part of history I’d never read much about before. It teaches us about hardships and how that makes us better people, slowly and almost without us realizing it . Elsa was a warrior in so many ways.\n\n']"

But not all legends are true, and the Wolf isn't the only danger lurking in the Wilderwood.As the only Second Daughter born in centuries, Red has one purpose—to be sacrificed to the Wolf in the Wood in the hope he'll return the world's captured gods.Red is almost relieved to go. Plagued by a dangerous power she can't control, at least she knows that in the Wilderwood, she can't hurt those she loves. Again.But the legends lie. The Wolf is a man, not a monster. Her magic is a calling, not a curse. And if she doesn't learn how to use it, the monsters the gods have become will swallow the Wilderwood—and her world—whole.""A brilliant dark fantasy debut!"" —Jodi Picoult, NYT bestselling author  Read more  ","['3.0 out of 5 stars', '3.0 out of 5 stars', '4.0 out of 5 stars', '5.0 out of 5 stars', '5.0 out of 5 stars', '5.0 out of 5 stars']","['\n3.5 stars\n', '\nRed Riding Hood meets Beauty and the Beast\n', '\nA great start to a series!\n', '\nEnjoyable read\n', '\nRichly imagined and beautifully written\n', '\nMoody, broody and atmospheric.\n']","['\n\n  This is not the first time I’ve had a reading experience with this, where I start strong, get waylaid in the middle, and then have no opportunity to pick it up and finish even though I’m so close to the end. This kind of pattern always screws me up (I’m a one or two session reader, often just one!) and leaves me uncertain how I feel about a story. Enter, FOR THE WOLF.I liked so much of this but was equally confused by just as much. This is a story that I definitely need to reread because I think it’s possible this would be an easy four star if I had read it normally.There are shades of familiar fairytales woven into the roots of this spooky forest magic story. But these parts are made equally their own thing. This is not YA but is written with similar YA beats, yet manages to be dark without crossing any ‘can’t turn back now’ lines.While this had some absolutely lovely turns of phrase, a slowburn romance, and tons of forest aesthetic, I definitely lost track of some scenes or events as they played out, and I did find myself losing the thread of the worldbuiling (probably explained in the beginning and then just forgotten, because I’m dumb and was too slow to read this; though I also think the mythology is supposed to be uncertain and skewed and that doesn’t help?), but I am definitely going to be keen for the follow up.\n\n', '\n\n  “I’d let the world burn before I hurt you.”This adult, gothic reimagining of Little Red Riding Hood somehow reminded me of not just Little Red Riding Hood but also Beauty and the Beast and Snow White too. For the Wolf has all the things I need to get invested in a story. Retelling, romance, mystery, elemental magic, enchanted forest, complicated relationships - I got all these just from reading the first chapter.Fascinatingly twisted from the start, the mystery was more than enough to make me keep reading. I’ve always loved a story set in an enchanted forest/woodland and For the Wolf has all of what I loved and more with its magical world building. Played with the combination of myth, folklore and fairytale, a fantasy lover would love this story that has an eerie and spooky atmosphere.And while I fell in love with the theme of the story and its promising start, my feelings slowly changed mainly due to the excessive amount of exposition that left me confused at times. I also find conflicts that could have been resolved through proper communication is not my favorite.Perhaps because of the image that Little Red Riding Hood planted in my head, I expected more angst and banter from Red and Wolf. I got more interested with the secondary characters and I wish there was more of Raffe.I loved the setting and the overall aesthetic and I’m still interested to know what happens next because I’m definite that For the Wolf is just the beginning of a more twisted and darker world.Trigger Warnings provided by the author:-Self harm for magic use (cutting)-Parental neglect/emotional abuse-Mentions of physical symptoms that might be triggering to those with emetophobia-Anxiety/panic attacks-Parental death-Gore-Mild audio/visual hallucinations-Religious abuse-Medium-heat romance (non-explicit)\n\n', '\n\n  This is a dark, richly imagined world where the Big Bad Wolf isn’t exactly what you were always told.It’s a world where the First Daughter is for the Throne, the Second Daughter is for the Wolf, and the Wolf is for the Wilderwood.Twin sisters Red and Neve are devastated that soon Red will be sent to the Wilderwood forest as a sacrifice to the Wolf. Legend has it that the Wolf demanded that payment in exchange for keeping the monsters of the forest at bay. The people also want the Five Kings back, and they hope that this human sacrifice will appease the Wolf enough to free them. When Red arrives at the forest she discovers that her knowledge of the Wilderwood and the Wolf are mostly tall tales and soon she will have to harness her mysterious and budding powers to save her world.This novel has the classic dark and brooding male love interest, the heroine who doesn’t need any man to save her, and a few evil villains added to the mix. It is a slowly paced tale with rich detail that never feels like information overload. I prefer fantasy with well-developed characters over heavy plot and world-building. This book struck a nice balance between fully imagined characters and a forest that literally comes alive.I took one star off because, sometimes, I found the plot dragged. The romance wasn’t for me, but I’m sure others will enjoy it.Still, I can’t wait for the sequel!\n\n', ""\n\n  This came up as a suggestion at my local public library... I'm glad I took it.- It's modern twist on some older fairy tales... Yeah, the plot is kind of predictable (good vs evil), but eh! it's a fairy tale, not a thriller. Just turn your brain off and enjoy the story and try to imagine the scenery.Looking forward to her next book ;-)\n\n"", '\n\n  I love, love, loved this book. The characters are dynamic and tortured, the imagery rich and beautiful. There is also fantastic interplay between politics and religion and myth, compelling the reader to question what is good and evil and what just is. The bonds of obligation, love, and family tie this book together beautifully. I eagerly anticipating the next.\n\n', '\n\n  Loved this so much! Moody, broody and atmospheric - can’t wait for the next one! Hannah is a word wizard, this was so beautifully written.\n\n']"

She was hard working, feisty, smart and quick with a clever comeback when taunted with insults meant to belittle her.  I enjoyed how Nero and Camille first connected through their mutual love of classic cars.  As a mechanic herself, she truly was the rare female who could keep him intrigued outside of the bedroom.  As a couple these two were drawn together like steel to a magnet forming a tight connection through their similar life experiences.While this story is a bit of a departure from the chaos and vengeful scheming we’ve witnessed in the previous tales, it does contain some violence along with plenty of drama, action, adventure and suspense.

She's the epitome of strong and willing to put herself on the line for those she loves. She is a warrior!!Tamlin is a mystery. You don't learn too much about him which makes the mystery of him so appealing.There are many secondary characters that were very intriguing and added to the whole of the story beautifully. We meet Lucien, Ianthe, and Rhysand who I'm pretty sure is going to play a much bigger role in this series than I had realized at the beginning.This book has all the elements of a great series. The writing is flawless and the story flows quite seamlessly.I'm already into the second book and can't wait to see what the author has in store.\n\n"", '\n\n  I\'d give it a 2 1/2.

  Wall Street Journal bestsellerWatch your most innovative ideas take flight by overcoming the forces that resist change The Human Element is for anyone who wants to introduce a new idea or innovation into the world. Most marketers, innovators, executives, activists, or anyone else in the business of creating change, operate on a deep assumption. It is the belief that the best (and perhaps only) way to convince people to embrace a new idea is to heighten the appeal of the idea itself. We instinctively believe that if we add enough value, people will eventually say ""yes."" This reflex leads us down a path of adding features and benefits to our ideas or increasing the sizzle of our messaging - all in the hope of getting others on board. We call this instinct the ""Fuel-based mindset."" The Fuel-based mindset explains so much of what we do, from adding countless trivial features to software, to bolting a sixth blade onto a shaving razor. By focusing on Fuel, innovators neglect the other half of the equation – the psychological Frictions that oppose change. Frictions create drag on innovation. And though they are rarely considered, overcoming these Frictions is essential for bringing new ideas into the world. The Human Element highlights the four Frictions that operate against innovation. Readers will discover:  Why their best ideas and initiatives often get rejected – despite their undeniable value How to disarm the forces of resistance that act against change How to transform the very Frictions that hold us back into catalysts for change  Perfect for business leaders, product managers, educators, and anyone else who seeks to bring new and exciting ideas to life, The Human Element is an indispensable resource to help people overcome the powerful forces of human nature that instinctively resist change.

They do all the work to make the bride’s day perfect. They follow along with the bride’s wishes and deal with the mounting pressure of the big day. The focus is always on the bride. Nina Manning’s, “The Bridesmaid,” mirrors this relationship in an unlikely friendship between two girls.Sasha first met Caitlin at Saxby House when they were children. Sasha’s parents work for the Clemonte’s on their estate. The girls were besties, inseparable, until the day Sasha has had enough. Enough of having to do things Caitlin’s way. Enough of putting up with Caitlin’s odd behaviour. Enough of the secrets.This novel is about toxic relationships and explores the reason behind these types of friendships. A slow burner, and more a mystery than a thriller, you’ll discover that nothing is as it seems. Like the one on the cover, a rose is beautiful to look at and has a beautiful aroma. However, every rose has its thorn and this rose, the bride, has a few. In an attempt to keep secrets for appearance's sake, people fail to connect with the most important people around them - thus perpetuating the problem. This is the bridesmaid’s story from the beginning of the friendship to the end of it.The author studied psychology and applied it to the relationships in this book. It’s a decades-long journey into why people behave the way they do. It’s a unique read because, for most of the book, the main characters are teenagers. Most psychological thrillers I’ve read have adult protagonists.I was gifted this advance copy by Nina Manning, Boldwood Books and NetGalley and was under no obligation to provide a review.\n\n"", '\n\n  I was unsure what to rate this. I really enjoyed this book and got sucked into it and boy was it ever a readable page turner...BUT it was not a thriller...not by my definition. This was more like a dramatic chick lit story with a bit of a mystery thrown in and I really liked it.The plot was interesting and I loved the format of before and now. It is told from the singular point of view and you really got to know the two main characters because of that. I really appreciate Nina Mannings writing style and the way she keeps you wanting to know more. The whole time I was reading this I kept saying to myself ""just one more chapter"". I was able to read it in a single sitting...that must account for something.

Most of the story was a slow build towards what I was hoping would be a carefully constructed surprise ending, but instead the last portion seemed rushed and more telling than showing. So great concept but the execution left something to be desired. But then again, I am picky. For readers who are just looking for a good distraction during pandemic lockdown or a distracting beach read, they'll like this. For those interested in authentic characters, clean story line and aha ending, not so much.\n\n"", '\n\n  3.25 stars.

Not long after moving in Sasha meets Caitlin, the privileged, wealthy, and mercurial daughter of the Clemonte family. The pair become fast friends and Sasha finds herself doing anything to maintain her friendship with Caitlin and to keep her happy. Fast forward about twenty years and Sasha, still the supportive friend, is meticulously planning Caitlin’s wedding to their childhood friend Chuck. As the wedding approaches, things start veering off course.The story is told from Sasha’s perspective during two timelines: when the girls are teens; and later, in their thirties. The chapters are short, which makes it easy to keep flipping the pages.This was a solid thriller, a bit slow at times, but one that I was still compelled to stay up late reading. I don’t know how I feel about the ending. I guess I was hoping for something more explosive to the tension that had been building. It did resolve things nicely, so there’s that. And it certainly changed my perception of some of the characters!Thanks to Netgalley and Boldwood Books for providing me with this ARC in exchange for my honest opinions.\n\n', '\n\n  I found it interesting from the moment I started it until the very end.

I was delighted therefore when I discovered it was on sale for $1.99 and promptly picked it up. And it is worth every good worth every good review it’s received and now I’m adding mine to the rest. It’s a delightful enemies to lovers romance.Lucy and Joshua are two executive assistants who sit side by side each working for a different CEO of a merged publishing company and right from the first day things have been strained. Lucy is a friendly, delightful young woman who is loved by everyone and Joshua isn’t. The first day they met Lucy smiled at him and Joshua ignored her and it’s been war between the two ever since. They are constantly trying to one up the other and their battles are delightfully written. I think I smiled through this entire book. There are so many cute moments in the book from where Lucy speed walks to keep up with Joshua on their way to the kitchen to them both going to HR about the other. The book is told entirely from Lucy’s POV so we don’t get why Joshua is such a jerk to her until later in the book and then are hearts start to melt and we all fall in love with him.There are so many already positive reviews for this book and I’m trying to keep this short so I’ll just finish up with read this book. It’s still only $2.99 and that’s a great price for something you are going to love.\n\n', '\n\n  Okay I’ve heard SO MUCH about this book and Joshua Templeton that I had to check this out for myself. 25% into the book and I was very confused. THIS is what everyone is flapping on about?? 50% into the book and I see the chemistry. But these two characters are so juvenile. It’s like watching wild animals mate. Biting and snipping at each other while getting it on. Where is the romance?? 75% into the story and I still don’t understand what the hell is really going on. It wasn’t until the last bloody chapter that we finally get any real headway into these characters and they are still holding back. I wanted to throw Josh’s ribbon pillow in my face and scream GROW UP!!! GAWD!!!! I’ll admit the way Josh takes care of Lucy is adorable and the way he can tell by a look in her face if she is freaking out. But he could have saved them both a whole lot of time if he just ask her out for pity sake.\n\n', '\n\n  From the very first chapter, I knew this wasn’t a typic  as l romcom. Sally Thorne has s literary style of writing that I’ve rarely encountered in the genre. It’s magically soothing and intoxicating all together. The book is a slow build to a beautiful climax (see what I did there?!) that feels so real. It’s a beautiful book and I’ll be reading it again I’m sure. But first, onto your next book. Thank you!\n\n', '\n\n  I have this book in paperback and on my ereader, so that I will always have it no matter where I am.  That’s how much I love it.  It is so good that I re-read it constantly and then I laugh loudly by myself at all the funny parts even though I know they’re going to happen.  And don’t get me started about Josh Templeman.... I want him to hold back my hair when I vomit ( you’ll understand this if you read the book) and who doesn’t love a guy who saves her lipstick kissed Post-it note and sticks it on his fridge, right?  I had no chance.  Neither do you... read this book... and you’re welcome!\n\n', ""\n\n  I enjoyed it from start to finish. I use to be an avid reader, but was going through a long cold spell of not reading anything. This book kept my eyes peeled to each page I turned. I really enjoyed the banter between the two leads, it kept things spicy. Would definarely recommend to friends and maybe if I'm feeling nice lend mine!\n\n"", '\n\n  Okay i give up on books easily but this one had me blushing and tearing up i love Joshua and Lucy’s chemistry and relationship development. To me, they are soulmates, and it’s a beautiful romantic journey. I love this book im so glad i read it, just a lovely read and ending. SPICY content. Joshua has certainly raised my standards in men….i recommend!\n\n', '\n\n  This was a gem of a book!  I had just finished ""Whisper Network"" and needed something a little light and not so much work to read.  ""The Hating Game"" was a super fast read as you just couldn\'t put it down as it moved nicely and quickly and had a great story line.  Loved the characters and could for sure see this as a movie.  Along the lines of the first Bridget Jones Diary category.  Left you with wanting more...  Not a serious book and for \'chick-lit\' this is probably one of the best ever written.\n\n', ""\n\n  I've had this book in my to-read for ages, but ever felt the urge to jump in. Even though the description grabbed me, I think the cover didn't really appeal to me.Glad I took the time to read. This book was quick a read for me right from the first page.

But the woman who shares her name has vanished, and assuming her identity just might get Clara some money to send back home.Clara must rely on resolve as strong as the steel Pittsburgh is becoming famous for and an uncanny understanding of business, attributes that quickly gain her Carnegie's trust. But she still can't let her guard down, not even when Andrew becomes something more than an employer. Revealing her past might ruin her future—and her family's.With captivating insight and heart, Carnegie's Maid is a book of fascinating 19th century historical fiction.

It interweaves Clara Kelly\'s fictional story to that of ""Andrew Carnegie\'s transformation from ruthless industrialist into the world\'s first true philanthropist.""The focus of this story is really Clara\'s life - she was shipped from Galway, Ireland to America, in hope of finding a job in service or in a factory; allowing her to send her earnings back home to help support her family who are still suffering the effects of the Irish potato famine. Instead, she lands a job in the Carnegie household, an error in identity providing her with a way out of poverty.What follows are ""journal type"" entries (not a formal journal, but all in the first person narrative and dated) of her life with the Carnegies. We get a glimpse into what shaped Andrew Carnegie\'s work-ethic, his relationship with his mother and brother Tom, and we also get a sense of his belief that all people are created equal and deserve the chance to a better life. Clara\'s relationship with Andrew is that of not only romantic interest (all very proper), but also an intellectual one. In her, he finds a sounding board to his ideas, and was challenged by her own ideas.Clara was a well developed character. Perhaps it was a little far-fetched to believe that Andrew Carnegie would have sought out the opinion and advice of his mother\'s lady\'s maid, but their relationship was lovely to watch unfold.This is not a book that is full of tension, nor does it have a ""mysterious twist"".

It was sooo good!  I loved the story (yes thank god there was one). The characters were well developed and likeable.  I also really enjoyed the relationship building between the main characters.  The heat between the sheets and many other places was also very well written.  It didn’t seem like too much sex because like I said there was a well written story.

When Daisy finds herself marrying a stranger just 3 hours after hopping on the back of his bike, in hopes to save her job, she has no idea what’s to come. Including a cross country move to live with her mysterious fake husband. And real feelings she told herself wouldn’t happen in their no strings, 3 month marriage arrangement.Jude, move over. There’s a hotter brother in town. I don’t think I can say it enough times. I loved this hero. I loved him. I literally LOVED him. I have a hero type. It’s strong and silent. A man of few words. But means what he does say. Sweet and sexy. Attentive, in all the ways. But can dirty talk too. And that is Flynn to a tee. But where he is calm and cool as a cucumber, Daisy is a wild ball of nerves and restless energy! She did enough jabbering for the two of them and then some. But gosh did I love her too.These two had some serious chemistry. And it gets HOT. Some of the sexy scenes fade out, but even the ones that do are sexy. The newspaper scene for one... (*fans self* thinking about it). That scene will live rent free in my head thank you very much. The humour really had me. The way the authors described scenes, like the ‘grinch’ one, had me cracking up. These brothers, and their hilarious antics, I couldn’t help but enjoy. There were some really sweet moments as well. That epilogue had me laughing and crying. It was perfectly beautiful.At times it felt young (which I typically don’t like) but I had so much fun reading this, I didn’t care. I really loved it. And I look forward to reading more from these sexy brothers! Though it’s going to be tough to beat my love for Flynn. If your looking for a fun and sexy read, read this!“The truth is, I think I fell in love with Daisy the first moment I saw her. Some part of me offered to save her because, deep down, I knew she’d save me.”\n\n', '\n\n  For those unfamiliar with the name of the author, they state, ‘A secret duo of romance authors team up under the pseudonym Max Monroe to bring you a sexy, laugh-out-loud new series…& more. ;)  Writing partners and long time friends, Max and Monroe strive to live and write all the fun, sexy swoon so often missing from their Facebook newsfeed. Sarcastic by nature, their two writing souls feel like they’ve found their other half.’One of the many aspects of the authors’ writing skills is the degree of humor that they infuse steamy erotica. The language is a bit overdone in the potty mouth category, but it fits the story just fine. Naughty all the way .A tease of their sparkling writing skills follows as we meet Flynn: “The four Winslow brothers in Vegas. What could go wrong? Ha. Pretty much every-[expletive]–thing can go wrong when all three of my brothers decided a boozy brunch to start the day was a grand idea. Although, so far, their drunken sins revolve around stumbling steps and being a little too loud for the early afternoon casino crowd, but my track record of knowing them my entire life predicts this day to be one hell of a chaotic rife. Says the bastard who always chooses to be the responsible sober brother of the group.’’The plot is summarized as follows, from Daisy’s vantage: “I need a ride,” I said to a sexy stranger on a Harley. Three hours later? A six-foot-tall Marilyn Monroe was officiating our Vegas wedding at the Happy Chapel. But it’s not love—it’s business—a marriage pact made out of desperation so my career doesn’t go up in flames. Sure, Flynn Winslow is a hot, broody, mysterious man that women all over the globe would sell their souls to land for real, but I have my eyes on the prize and our marriage arrangement will end in three months with no strings attached. Right? Or will it all go out the window when I have to move in with Mr. Mysterious and our fake marriage starts to feel remarkably real? I wish it were as easy as telling myself,  Do not fall in love with your fake husband, Daisy, but apparently, when feelings get involved, not everything that happens in Vegas knows how to stay in Vegas.’It is a rollercoaster ride sparkling with erotica and guffaws. Enjoy a naughty outing in Vegas! Grady Harp, November 21\n\n', '\n\n  I laughed, I cried, I laughed some more.  I loved this book.  It’s one of my fav reads. This is the second book in the Winslow Brothers series about Flynn.  He is known as the quiet one.  He keeps to himself and doesn’t speak unless it is necessary but he’s a good guy, loyal and intelligent and a gorgeous alpha.  Daisy is pretty much the opposite- a bit of a scattered brain, bubbly, friendly but still as successful and beautiful inside and,out.  I absolutely loved their banter and smiled and laughed often.  This story warmed my heart.  I voluntarily received an a gorgeous complete arc copy from the author with thanks.\n\n']"

  NOT YOUR AVERAGE 1950s CHICAGO P.I.P.I. Lou Fleener’s got a great disguise—he’s kind of short, slightly pudgy, and a little nondescript. But whatever you do, don’t get in a fight with him, even if you’ve brought a couple of buddies. Because you’re gonna lose every time. Some people just have a gift. And Lou has a second one, a little something for the ladies—he can dance like an Arthur Murray instructor. His best friend, movie-star handsome, socially awkward Dion ""Monk"" Monkton, has his own super power: working out intricate and diabolical revenge plans.Cozy readers will adore the romance, the snappy jokes, and Lou’s spitfire wife Cassidy. There’s also enough fast-moving action for hard-boiled fans, and a quirky brand of noir that will appeal to classicists looking for the next Raymond Chandler.Missing AmandaLou and Monk get hustled into finding the kidnapped daughter of Chicago mob boss, Duke Braddock. Thing is, there’s no kidnapping, there’s no daughter. It’s all a scam to stir up a gang war to get Braddock’s guy named mayor.It turns out, if you accidentally get mixed up in a gang war, working out intricate and diabolical revenge plans is a handy super power to have on your side. Monk’s got the brains, Lou’s got the moves, and newcomer Cassidy Adams provides the looks. They all provide the fast-moving action, leading to the most satisfying ending you could ever want when Lou and company actually find…the missing Amanda.Seriously?Nazis in America! Seriously?Lou and Cassidy are hired by an elderly survivor of an infamous Nazi death camp who swears her new neighbor was a guard there. So now they’re up against a gang of ruthless killers who shouldn’t even exist. Add a gun-toting crook who thinks Monk cheated him at cards; add a new lady for the ever-awkward Monk, and you’ve got a thriller filled with trademark Feener fights, humor and romance.The Devil In Her HeartMonk’s in a lot of trouble—grabbed and beaten by a revenge-seeking killer, stripped of all their money. Lou and Cassie are caught flat-footed when they’re suddenly broke.He’s in California, they’re in Chicago. With no money and no idea where he is, can they rescue their friend and get back what’s theirs?The Classy Detective AgencyIt’s 1960 in glamorous Chicago, and Lou and his wife Cassidy are broke. They devise a scheme to advertise themselves as sophisticated private eyes catering to the city’s elite, but whip-smart as they are, they aren’t prepared for the stealthy criminals hiding among Chicago’s rich and famous.Set up to take the fall for an art heist, Cassidy's arrested and Lou's branded a cop killer and hunted throughout the city. With Monk still in California, they're on their own. Lou's Plan B might not be as elegant as Monk's, but it's wildly entertaining and true to his guiding principle: Always do the unexpected.Ticket to HeavenChicago’s sleaziest businessman is trying to pay off his sins. The cruel, strange real estate tycoon Elwood Tymms—known as “Terrible Tymms”—is dying and before he goes, he’s trying to throw all his money to charitable causes in an off-the-wall effort to buy his way into heaven. But Tymms has a problem: he’s got so many enemies he might end up assassinated before he can finish giving away his cash—and in his mind that means he’d end up in hell. Cassidy and Lou agree to act as his security detail and Tymms ends up taking shelter in their apartment. Big surprise...he’s not the best roommate.Filthy RichDown-and-out comedian “Filthy"" Rich wasn’t always living on the edge, telling viciously dirty jokes in the seediest possible strip clubs.

He’d moved on—or at least he thought he had until those old emotions come tumbling back with the vengeance of a forest fire. He’s reminded of how much he’d loved Mindy, wanted her, swore to marry her. Why couldn’t he forget her? Resist her? Deny her his heart? Because he’d fallen for her at ten and never came back up for air.How can he forgive her for stealing his daughter from him? Is love stronger than the mistakes they’ve made?

  “Delightful . . . [a] captivating and slyly subversive fictional paean to the real women whose work on the Oxford English Dictionary went largely unheralded.”—The New York Times Book Review WINNER OF THE AUSTRALIAN BOOK INDUSTRY AWARD • “A marvelous fiction about the power of language to elevate or repress.”—Geraldine Brooks, New York Times bestselling author of People of the BookEsme is born into a world of words. Motherless and irrepressibly curious, she spends her childhood in the Scriptorium, an Oxford garden shed in which her father and a team of dedicated lexicographers are collecting words for the very first Oxford English Dictionary. Young Esme’s place is beneath the sorting table, unseen and unheard. One day a slip of paper containing the word bondmaid flutters beneath the table. She rescues the slip and, learning that the word means “slave girl,” begins to collect other words that have been discarded or neglected by the dictionary men. As she grows up, Esme realizes that words and meanings relating to women’s and common folks’ experiences often go unrecorded. And so she begins in earnest to search out words for her own dictionary: the Dictionary of Lost Words. To do so she must leave the sheltered world of the university and venture out to meet the people whose words will fill those pages. Set during the height of the women’s suffrage movement and with the Great War looming, The Dictionary of Lost Words reveals a lost narrative, hidden between the lines of a history written by men. Inspired by actual events, author Pip Williams has delved into the archives of the Oxford English Dictionary to tell this highly original story. The Dictionary of Lost Words is a delightful, lyrical, and deeply thought-provoking celebration of words and the power of language to shape the world.

A friend in Australia sent me a copy of this book as she thought I\'d enjoy it.  I didn\'t just enjoy it, I loved this book.  I loved Esme and her story,  I loved the words and it was interesting to learn how women\'s words (and women themselves) were invisible in the late 1800\'s and later.  This book is based on the Oxford English Dictionary and the work involved in making it and the people involved in the words.  Now that sounds quite dry and that is just the opposite of what the book was like.  A number of reviewers said the book was ""original"" and that is the perfect descriptor of this book.  The women who people this novel are extraordinary, even in their ordinariness.  Such a wonderful read.\n\n', '\n\n  When I was young and I asked my mother how to spell a word she would say “Look it up in the dictionary.” And I would reply I can’t because I can’t spell it.” This historical fiction covers the years 1886 to 1989 and significant events told through the words of Esme Nicoll.At age five she introduces us to the Oxford English Dictionary and how it is compiled, how decisions are made on what words are included and, more importantly, the words, mainly words related too and used by women are omitted. Her father is one of the associates and her first relationship with the dictionary’s workings is sitting under the work table and picking up the discarded slips.Esme becomes friends with an actress who introduces her to the world of the protesting suffragettes. Not a place where she is comfortable and she struggles with what actions in which she can become involved. This friendship leaves another major mark on Esme’s life.The third event is World War One which has a major impact of the progress of the dictionary as young men enlist. Her wedding to Gareth, a compositor with the Oxford University Press who is working on the dictionary takes place before he goes to the front. It also leads her to a new use of words and language working with soldiers who have lost the ability to speak as a result of what they suffered in battle.The dictionary is finally completed in November, 1928 and work has already started on the first of several supplements before the second edition is released in 1989. This is a historical novel for people who love words. The ending brought tears to my eyes.I don’t always read the Afterwords and Acknowledgments but in this case I urge you do so as the history of the dictionary continues. They identify the historical people and reinforce the true activities that are in the novel.Reviewed June 23, 2021\n\n']"

Did I mention that there’s only one double bed in Etienne’s cabin? Suffice it to say, Sam finally realizes he’s in love with his best friend.I really liked the plot in that falling in love with a best friend is one of my favourite tropes. The two MCs are believable and very sympathetic. Sam’s family is great, particularly his grandmother. The book can be read fairly quickly and one is left with a warm, fuzzy feeling at the end.\n\n', '\n\n  This fluffy Christmas novella is the perfect antidote to grey, gloomy winter days.  Sam and Etienne’s best-friends-to-lovers tale is sweet and satisfying, with just the right amount of heat.Set amid the world of figure skating and mostly at an upper-end ski resort in Quebec, Andrews makes the transition in their relationship adorably awkward and fun.  Sam’s bi-awakening was generally non-traumatic in all the best ways.Side characters add to the lightheartedness delightfully, especially Bree and Sam’s grandma.  Despite the characters’ inner turmoil, this is a low-angst, fun, romantic romp.The only downside (for me) is I feel this could have easily been a full-length novel, more fully developing the men’s friendship prior to them getting together.

  A biography examining the final days of Freddie Mercury in the dawn of AIDS and the legacy he left behind. For the first time, the final years of one of the world’s most captivating rock showman are laid bare. Including interviews from Freddie Mercury’s closest friends in the last years of his life, along with personal photographs, Somebody to Love is an authoritative biography of the great man. Here are previously unknown and startling facts about the singer and his life, moving detail on his lifelong search for love and personal fulfilment, and of course his tragic contraction of a then killer disease in the mid-1980s. Woven throughout Freddie’s life is the shocking story of how the HIV virus came to hold the world in its grip, was cruelly labelled “The Gay Plague” and the unwitting few who indirectly infected thousands of men, women and children—Freddie Mercury himself being one of the most famous. The death of this vibrant and spectacularly talented rock star, shook the world of medicine as well as the world of music. Somebody to Love finally puts the record straight and pays detailed tribute to the man himself. “Touts rare—and in some cases, never before seen—images of Mercury and new insight into his life.”—People “The book could be a standalone epidemiological study about the history of HIV/AIDS even without Mercury. But eventually, it weaves him into the timeline, giving a detailed account of his personal life, and his battle with the disease that tragically took him at age 45 in 1991. The result is a powerfully emotional read.”—Rolling Stone  Read more  ","['4.0 out of 5 stars', '4.0 out of 5 stars', '5.0 out of 5 stars', '5.0 out of 5 stars', '5.0 out of 5 stars', '5.0 out of 5 stars', '5.0 out of 5 stars', '4.0 out of 5 stars']","['\nSome Inaccuracies in this book\n', '\nGood but not the best\n', '\nExcellent book about the life of Freddie Mercury\n', '\nWow\n', '\nWell written book\n', '\nAmazing!\n', '\nInteresting read.

Ava is young and still in college. She currently lives next door to her older brother who she’s very close with. Alex and Ava’s brother are best friends and went to college together. When Ava’s brother goes off Central America for a year, he asks Alex to keep an eye on Ava. In order to monitor Ava, Alex decides to move into his friend’s apartment so he’s right next door. That way he can still focus on his business while keeping tabs on Ava. Ava feels as though Alex unfeeling, so she bets her friends that she can get him to feel an array of emotions. There is a deep traumatic event that ties the two of them together and they discover it along with a love that neither of them was prepared for.There are not enough words to describe how amazing this book is. Sometimes a book comes along and it wrecks you in the best way possible. I was dreaming about this book for days after reading it. I ended up re-reading it (along with my favorite parts) over and over again. There were pieces to this mystery surrounding Ava’s past along with Alex that I didn’t see coming. The whole book itself felt like a blockbuster movie it was so good. Alex reminded me of the Grinch in a way where the one woman comes in and melts his ice cold heart and every day he’s around her it grows just a little bit more. There love and attraction wasn’t instant. Ava put in a lot of work when it came to her relationship with Alex and he was an alpha hole like no other. His possessiveness towards Ava should be chauvinistic but I found it utterly romantic. There is a big mystery surrounding the couple and there is a lot of new trauma as result. I like that the ending was hard won on Alex’s part and it didn’t end perfectly. It’s really hard to give an in-depth review without spoiling too much.This book will stay with you long after you read it. It will touch a piece of you that you didn’t know existed.

I was rooting for them the entire way and finally they get their HEA.\n\n', '\n\n  A new author for me and I was pleasantly surprised.  Twisted love is a dark romance. The story is aboutAva and Alex.  This is a pair you want to root for.  Ava is beautiful inside and out.  Alex is an intense and dark.  Alex is Ava’s brother’s best friend.  He asks her to lookout for her when her brother goes to another country for school. They are attracted to each other and genuinely like each other and seem a good match. A few unexpected surprises and twists keep the story compelling.  I voluntarily received an arc copy of this book from HiddenGems\n\n', ""\n\n  Ava is sweet and good. She believes in the good of everyone. Complete opposite of Alex who is dark, and authoritative and dominant.The tension was off the charts for the first 3 quarters of the book. It lacked depth for me in the last quarter, but I was quickly reeled back in with those last few pages. Has a princess been naughty?Overall, an impressive standalone in a universe that I can't wait to dive deeper into!\n\n"", '\n\n  Once started to read this book I found it difficult to put down. I read it in one day. The hero,  Alex, is so complex that you could despise him one minute but several pages later you could like him. As for the heroine, Ava, she too has her own deep issues. You felt for her and all she has been through. It takes the both of them to have to work through a lot together to get to their “happy” place. Thoroughly enjoyed this book. Will have to read another Ana Huang book!\n\n', ""\n\n  When I saw that this book had grovelling, best friend's brother, grumpy/sunshine trope,a possessive male character (I can die for those lol) kinda forced proximity, a bed-sharing scene and great friend group, i downloaded this with speed. And it was being recommended all over booktok (I’m on there 24/7 that’s how I found it) so might as well read it.The dirty talking in this book is freaking top notch haha. I loved every part of it. There is a part in chapter 22 page 162, on kindle it says 1695 people have it highlighted. That part touched my spirit!!! Haha.The romance at the beginning of the book was cute. And the operation plan her and her friends had going on was also funny.But towards the end, it wasn’t as much I guess for me. There was more telling than showing. Most people also said that about it. I wouldn’t say it is fast paced but there rate it went from 0-100 was uhm…Although it’s a chill book, there are some TW.It’s a great FICTION book, I enjoyed his possessiveness. The dirty talking like I said is 💯.\n\n"", ""\n\n  I loved this book.  I loved the revenge schemes, the chemistry and how Ava was the light to Alex's darkness.\n\n""]"

You witness Ryan's internal need to help Zoey despite her constant battle for independence. Stone does an impeccable job creating a unique story that genuine hockey fans will love and appreciate. I love being able to read a story where not only does the female lead grow and progress over the duration of the book, but the male also develops in an equally pleasing manner.

Zoey and Ryan are anything but typical and I think that’s a large part of what made me love them so much. They’re not the lead characters you expect to read: they’re real and human and down to earth. Living in one of the hockey towns mentioned in this book, I wouldn’t be at all surprised to run into Ryan or Zoey on the street, and I feel like I could have an amazing conversation with either one of them.

Somewhere when I started this series with “The Girls Across The Bay” I read that it was book 1 of a trilogy but ala Douglas Adams “The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy” that reached at least 5 books I have now read book 4 of this trilogy and it has a big hint that book 5 is on the way and am I ever glad. As anyone who reads my reviews has surely noticed I am very stingy with 5 star ratings but this book grabbed me very early and just got better and better the farther I read and I kept telling myself if the author didn’t blow the ending this was going to be a 5 star rating. And what a solid ending it turned out to be! I could hardly imagine how Ms O’Brien was going to tie all of Madigan and Grace’s seemingly unrelated investigations together but somehow after so many twists and turns and false suspects everything came together in an absolutely logical conclusion and enough clues were delivered throughout the story that one should have been able to identify the perp but I admit I had one of the many suspects picked as the culprit and I was dead wrong. Through the earlier books in this series my opinion of Madigan and Grace has waffled back and forth from not liking them much to liking them quite a lot but always feeling a lot of empathy for them and in this book it started out a bit like that but I sure grew to really liking them at the end and I’m looking forward to another great investigation with them. BTW Mac has become a top notch character and possibly the best one in the book. Another big surprise was the ending of the Raven/Melanie subplot which again I never saw coming.

This a dark bully romance and TWs include attempted rape, physical abuse, sexual abuse, toxic masculinity, and just about any other TW you can think of. These are potentially harmful topics so if you are sensitive to any of these matters PLEASE educate yourself before reading.That being said, this author did a fantastic job of weaving all these topics through an exciting and sexy narrative. The story follows Rika Fane, a young woman whos finally about to spread her wings and make a name for herself, beyond the one she was born into and the people around her who do nothing but coddle her. But Rika knows she is so much more. And Michael Crist, a devilishly handsome and dangerous man has seen that fire in her eyes too. They've grown up together, orbiting around each other but never really making a move. Michael knows she likes to play the game and in her, he's found a formidable opponent. Amidst their whirlwind sexual escapades, through a narrative that alternates between present-day and 3 years prior, we discover how something that happened on Devil's Night 3 years ago (Halloween Eve) has changed Rika and Michael's lives forever, as well as Michael's friends Kai, Damon, and Will. Rika betrayed them all, and they demand revenge.This book is a roller coaster. You will find yourself loving and simultaneously hating every character. Rika is rash but she fights for what she wants. Michael has serious anger issues (for real I hope at the end of this book he goes to some therapy) but he's loyal till the end. His friends, however problematic they are and their desire to take what isn't theirs, are a product of the white rich American suburbs. I don't know if Douglas did this intentionally, but I found this book as almost a critique of toxic masculinity and its presence not only in high school but the world beyond those gated communities. Michael and his friends, for most of their lives, are able to evade any repercussions of their actions. They destroy and wreak havoc because they can. But in the end, your past always catches up with you.Truthfully, I enjoyed the romance. I won't apologize for liking a novel with problematic themes because I don't think that's fair. Its like kink (which btw this book has a lot of!!!), just because you enjoy it between the sheets doesn't mean you'll stand for it in the streets. But also, maybe you do and that's totally fine!! Either way, its ok to like books maybe society says you shouldn't. Reading is about pleasure and enjoyment, and this book definitely brought me that.The sex scenes were A1, probably the best I have ever read before. The building tension and romance were sickeningly delicious. If you're a fan of Douglas' other works or just dark smutty thriller romances in general.. you will devour this!\n\n"", '\n\n  🌟 🌟 🌟 🌟 🌟 (5/5 Stars)“𝑂𝑤𝑛 𝑖𝑡, 𝑜𝑟 𝑖𝑡 𝑤𝑖𝑙𝑙 𝑜𝑤𝑛 𝑦𝑜𝑢.“ - 𝐶𝑜𝑟𝑟𝑢𝑝𝑡 𝑏𝑦 𝑃𝑒𝑛𝑒𝑙𝑜𝑝𝑒 𝐷𝑜𝑢𝑔𝑙𝑎𝑠Do you ever buy a book and then hold off reading it for one reason or another and then you finally pick up the book and you’re kicking yourself for not having done it sooner?

One day he was a doctor treating the dying, and the next he was a patient struggling to live. And just like that, the future he and his wife had imagined evaporated. When Breath Becomes Air chronicles Kalanithi’s transformation from a naïve medical student “possessed,” as he wrote, “by the question of what, given that all organisms die, makes a virtuous and meaningful life” into a neurosurgeon at Stanford working in the brain, the most critical place for human identity, and finally into a patient and new father confronting his own mortality. What makes life worth living in the face of death? What do you do when the future, no longer a ladder toward your goals in life, flattens out into a perpetual present? What does it mean to have a child, to nurture a new life as another fades away? These are some of the questions Kalanithi wrestles with in this profoundly moving, exquisitely observed memoir. Paul Kalanithi died in March 2015, while working on this book, yet his words live on as a guide and a gift to us all. “I began to realize that coming face to face with my own mortality, in a sense, had changed nothing and everything,” he wrote. “Seven words from Samuel Beckett began to repeat in my head: ‘I can’t go on. I’ll go on.’” When Breath Becomes Air is an unforgettable, life-affirming reflection on the challenge of facing death and on the relationship between doctor and patient, from a brilliant writer who became both.

In 'When Breath Becomes Air,' Kalanithi accounts his transition from his childhood and the path that drew him towards an initially unlikely career in medicine through the end of residency, and ultimately the tragic derailment of a once promising outlook. Beyond the difficulty of dealing with terminal illness, the author is able to find some answers about what it means to live a life fully, however imperfect it may be.As an aspiring doctor and having been impacted by a familial death from lung cancer around the time of my reading this, there are many passages in the story that resonated with me. At times it required me to put the book down to really process the feelings that I had, and to understand on a deep level the vulnerabilities we all experience as human beings. I will always appreciate the impact of Paul's story on my own maturing perspective.\n\n"", '\n\n  I don\'t normally write book reviews. But I am super compelled to write one.Paul\'s brave story of journeying through med-school and facing lung cancer, was so inspiring and real.The book is well-written, with a table-spoon of medical jargon (but made me feel intelligent nonetheless), and get\'s to the point without droning on irrelevant details.I personally think the book could have been longer and detailed more in his life as a neurologist and the challenges of the practice. However, his whole book was based on ""to what degree should we sustain life, if there isn\'t much quality or value of life remaining"".This is a must-read for everyone. Helps us realize our mortality, and the realization that bravery comes through vulnerability.\n\n', '\n\n  This is an exploration by an intelligent, highly accomplished neurosurgeon who searched for the real purpose of life by studying and fixing the brain. The miracle of the brain’s workings could hold answers to help humanity understand it’s purpose. The reader travels with him on the intellectual paths he takes with humor, compassion and love. We also travel with him on his journey with an incurable disease, at a tragically young age,  that forces him to face his mortality with the wisdom.I loved this book. It is not religious as so many of this type of books are. It is a deep exploration into topics that help us lead a richer life and a more peaceful and accepting death.\n\n', ""\n\n  I cried so much reading this book. Personally I did an English Specialist with a Psychology Major. I've never quite felt right after graduating and constantly unsure of what to do. But Kalanithi presents such a beautiful memoir that there is real potential for cross-disciplinary understanding that the patient and physician are at the end of the day human- that there's real pain and emotion that only when you inhabit both roles that you start to see that even as we are dying and understanding every unique detail and facet of why we are dying: we can't come to grips with the fact that we absolutely love the world. I have lent this book out immediately after finishing it realizing that how fragile life is, how easy it is to forget that the love of wisdom, the love of psychology, the love of literature: it's all just the love of living. I think even as he described time and space senses erosion as he got sicker that he never stopped loving what he does, the people around him- the fact this memoir is littered with literary and psychological references and even humour just makes it more meaningful- what we know is how little we know and how much still needs to be researched. I hope his wife and his colleagues take the time to keep trying to answer what Paul Kalanithi couldn't in the time he worked and in the time he wrote.\n\n"", '\n\n  Moving, insightful and easy to read.Following Kalanithi on his short journey to the end we all experience, the book is. once illuminating and intensely private. He shares the science, the philosophy, the emotions of imminent death,  in a skilfully written autobiography of the last two years of his life. At a time when he begins the final year of learning his specialty, he is struck by lightning with a diagnosis of inoperable cancer.  Most intriguing is the final chapter written by his wife after he has died. She comes to realize that love doesn’t die even when a loved one has.\n\n', ""\n\n  I was recommended this by a friend who found himself in the same situation - a physician who had what could be a mass detected during a checkup. While he has a happy ending to his story, this is a heartbreaking story of a life that comes to an end too soon and what goes through your mind when you see it coming and can't do anything to stop it.It should be depressing, and you may well find bits here and there that leave you incredibly sad, but overall this is a story about enjoying what you have while you have it and making the most of your opportunities no matter what might come next.\n\n"", ""\n\n  I really loved this book. It is the type of book that needs to be read more than once as one gets tied up in it emotionally and thereby you miss a lot of the more precious meaning that it is trying to convey. It made me sad as here was a man with great intellect that was lost too soon. It was obvious that he was set to work out some of life's deeper philosophical questions. His wide breadth of education and study would have enabled him to give some of us the understanding with some of the deeper of life's questions that we ask but are not able to find an answer to. I believe he would have been able to do that for us and for that reason I mourn his loss. The book is very well written and should be read by all.\n\n"", '\n\n  This book was chosen for our book club. I thoroughly enjoyed it and was extremely touched by the authors honesty and openness about his journey to self discovery in terms of practicing medicine and in realizing the kind of practitioner he wanted to be. The last part of the book, written by his wife, was touching and humbling as she described their journey together. This also gave the reader insight into who he was from the eyes of another. All in all the book was excellent and I felt privileged  to have read it.\n\n']"

When she excepted the truths I felt them. When she felt betrayed I felt it.My favourite part of Scarlett’s writing is that I feel it. That I get lost in the story and forget where and who I am.I can not wait to share my love of this book With every single person I encounter.The lore is original and exciting I can’t wait to experience this world over and over again.\n\n', ""\n\n  If you love vampire love stories, this is worth reading. I loved certain aspects of the book such as:-FMC can wield knives, swords + daggers + can fight.-MMC is a broody vampire king who is also gallant with an interesting past.-the concept of vassal + vampire relationships + consent.-steamThe only complaints I had about the book was that the enemies to lovers dragged on + it was to the point of annoying at times. The concept of reincarnation was a huge plot in the story + honestly could have been further developed as it added so many interesting elements yet when it got that point, it became anti-climatic. And I guess for me, this is just a personal thing but I'm tired of reading about strong FMC's that are reactive. I found her to be reactive rather than strategic most of the time, and only a few times did she actually start to show what she was capable of.Overall still a good story if you love an enemies to lovers vampire romance\n\n""]"

I think I was expecting a bit more darkness after reading the blurb, it seemed fairy tame, at least compared to others I have read. Obviously, this might be darker spice for some readers.I think if this was a full length book where we were able to see some of their relationship develop and learn more about their pasts it would have made this book “darker”.

I’m all for some physical dominance but maybe I’m getting too old because I don’t have any interest in my partner having me act out submissive rolls like that. Too each their own, I’m sure a lot will love it. But that part is just not for me.\n\n', '\n\n  This is such a sexy, great read!

  An indolent college student creates a chaotic fictional world in this classic of Irish literature: “A marvel of imagination, language, and humor” (New Republic).   In this comic masterpiece, our unnamed narrator—a student at University College, Dublin, who spends more time drinking and working on his novel than attending classes—creates a character, a pub owner named Trellis, who himself is devoted mainly to writing and sleeping. Soon Trellis is collaborating with an author of cowboy romances, and from there unspools a brilliantly unpredictable adventure that James Joyce himself called “a really funny book.”   “’Tis the odd joke of modern Irish literature—of the three novelists in its holy trinity, James Joyce, Samuel Beckett and Flann O’Brien, the easiest and most accessible of the lot is O’Brien. . . . Flann O’Brien was too much his own man, Ireland’s man, to speak in any but his own tongue.” —The Washington Post   “As with Scott Fitzgerald, there is a brilliant ease in [O’Brien’s] prose, a poignant grace glimmering off every page.” —John Updike   “One of the best books of our century.” —Graham Greene     Read more  ","['5.0 out of 5 stars', '2.0 out of 5 stars', '5.0 out of 5 stars', '5.0 out of 5 stars', '5.0 out of 5 stars', '5.0 out of 5 stars']","['\nAn absorbing, high quality book\n', '\nNonsense\n', ""\nFlann O'Brien\n"", '\nA Masterpiece!

I just didn’t get it.\n\n', '\n\n  ""At Swim-Two-Birds"", Brian O\'Nuallain\'s first novel, is a hilarious and surrealistic masterpiece.  he incorporated a blend of farce, satire and fantasy in plots within plots, with a distinctive dancing intellect and Celtic wit.  though it\'s been a century since he crafted this astonishing story, it still vibrantly shines.\n\n', '\n\n  This is, above all, a funny and playful book, playful with itself and the various conceits of fiction: the suspension of disbelief, the conventions of  form, and the pretensions of rhetoric.  Think of it as Pirandello meets  the Marx Brothers.""At Swim-Two-Birds"" delights in rapid-fire  wordplay and sophomoric experimentation (there are three alternative  beginnings to the story).  O\'Brien succeeds in this bombastic flair partly  because he doesn\'t take the literary enterprise--his own included--too  seriously.  He  races along at a Groucho-like pace, only to slow down in  wonderfully overwritten and overwrought scenes:""Together the two  strong men, joyous in the miracle of their health, put their bulging thews  and the fine ripple of their sinews together at the arm-pits of the  stricken king as they bent over him with their grunting red faces, their  four heels sinking down in the turf of the jungle with the stress of their  fine effort as they hoisted the madman to the tremulous support of his  withered legs.""Indeed!James Joyce praised O\'Brien as  ""a real author, with the true comic spirit,"" and Graham Greene  called this ""a book in a thousand....in the line of Tristram Shandy  and Ulysses.""  Like Joyce, O\'Brien dazzles us with language and the  sheer sound of words. The narrative is interrupted with rhetorical notes  (""Name of figure of speech: Litotes [or Meiosis]""), populated by  varying narrators ""Tour de force by Brinsley, vocally interjected,  being a comparable description in the Finn canon:,"" and buoyed by  dialogue that variously recalls 30\'s screwball comedies,B-movie Westerns,  and bad courtroom dramas.O\'Brien himself offers some literary  ""theory"" that illustrates his comic sensibility and offers sly  clues for his delighted (and maybe perplexed) reader:  ""...a  satisfactory novel should be a self-evident sham to which the reader could  regulate at will the degree of his credulity,"" and, ""Most authors  spend their time saying what has been said before--usually said much better  (Page 33)."" Flann O\'Brien\'s command of--and upending of--narrative  forms, and the hilarity of his farce make this an essential addition to any  comic library.  Then again, I could be wrong.(Buy it!)\n\n', '\n\n  ""You have left your reader behind,"" James Joyce told Flann, while, as Flann himself put it, he brandished ""Finnegan\'s Wake in his left hand.""  This is the most brilliant book I have read in years, something I read from beginning to end, going back, going over again, laughing out loud in the bathtub.  This book has done things contemporary writers are still afraid to approach, and it will go on that way, because Flann O\'Brien was daring and inventive and made Irish literature his home and Irish literature must thank him for that.\n\n', '\n\n  Excellent copy of the book, mailed in solid packaging, arrived safely and within a week of ordering. Highly recommend this dealer.\n\n']"

A blended family from San Diego have rented an RV to drive cross-country, on the way to a new job and a new beginning. Dad and his teenage son, Blake and Mom with her teenage daughter, Riley are trying to make a go of their new family. Because of a terrible misunderstanding, Riley is left behind at a giant truck stop, located on the edge of a desert. The family soon realizes their mistake but by then Riley has disappeared.

Then it becomes clear that each and every one of these family members have secrets, huge secrets. Where is Riley? Did someone kidnap her? Did she leave of her own accord?

Thank you to Joffe Books, NetGalley and the author for the e-ARC in exchange for an honest review.\n\n', ""\n\n  Rick Mofina is a new to me author. His latest book is Search for Her.Mofina starts off with a frightening premise. Fourteen year old Riley decides to wait in the RV while the rest of her newly blended family heads into the truck stop. When they get back on the road, they assume she is taking a nap in the bedroom. It's not until they're miles down the road that anyone genuinely checks. And yup, you guessed it - she's missing....The search for Riley is anything but easy. The police don't seem to believe Grace and husband John that it was an accident. Instead they're focusing on the family as suspects. The police work in Search for Her is busy, with many agencies involved as the case crosses state lines. Although all the right words are there, I had a hard time believing some of the investigation. Information or leads are discovered at fortuitous points in the story. Technology breaks down and isn't discovered for days. Mofina gives us lots of suspects right from the get go including the family. It seems every one of them is hiding something. The listener is given hints as to each family member's hidden secrets, but it takes a while before they are revealed. This does serve to keep the listener engaged. There are also lots of peripheral characters that may or may not have a bearing on the case. One caught my eye as the way they were portrayed was just too 'good' IMO.Understandably, the family is panicked. Especially Grace. And I felt for her - I really did. But I got so tired of her caterwauling 'Where's Riley?' I know, I know, her child is missing. Character development takes a back seat in Search for Her. Instead, it action that propels the book forward. There are twists along the way, but some of them seemed awkward to me, including the reasoning and mind set of the initial suspect.I chose to listen to Search for Her. The reader was Jennifer Jill Araya. This was a first listen of this narrator for me. She has a nice clear speaking voice, enunciates well, paces her speaking speed, and is, for the most part, really easy to listen to. She provides tones and voices for many, including males that are believable. She is indeed a very expressive reader and captures the tone of Mofina's book with her interpretation.Mofina hits all the right notes for what I would call 'light suspense.' But, I prefer my suspense a little darker and my police procedures a little more believable. Overall, an easy read for the beach bag this summer.\n\n"", ""\n\n  Rick Mofina is one of my go to authors when I want a captivating read and Search For Her is his latest mystery/thriller.A family's cross country move turns into a journey from hell when the 14 yr old daughter goes missing at a busy truck stop.

I started with Look the Part because I have heard nothing but good things, and she definitely did not disappoint! I absolutely ADORED this novel. If you love the single parent, lust-hate and beautiful connection relationship then this one is for you!.This story is about two individuals who have both been through so much and with love, compassion, sacrifice, and acceptance they learn to move on. When our heroine Ellen has an interview to move into the office space above Flints office she immediately is taken aback with how attracted she is to him.. Flint agrees to move Ellen into his complex not knowing that she was a music therapist.. and therefore creating immense amount of noise all day. Flint has had enough and is going to evict her until he realizes just how much his son has taken a liking to Ellen, and whenever Ellen is around Flint she makes him feel things he never thought he’d feel again..“𝙒𝙝𝙮 𝙖𝙧𝙚 𝙮𝙤𝙪 𝙝𝙪𝙢𝙢𝙞𝙣𝙜?” “𝘽𝙚𝙘𝙖𝙪𝙨𝙚,” 𝙄 𝙬𝙝𝙞𝙨𝙥𝙚𝙧, 𝙠𝙚𝙚𝙥𝙞𝙣𝙜 𝙢𝙮 𝙚𝙮𝙚𝙨 𝙤𝙣 𝙝𝙞𝙨 𝙩𝙞𝙚, “𝙞𝙩 𝙘𝙖𝙡𝙢𝙨 𝙢𝙮 𝙝𝙚𝙖𝙧𝙩.” “𝙒𝙝𝙖𝙩’𝙨 𝙬𝙧𝙤𝙣𝙜 𝙬𝙞𝙩𝙝 𝙮𝙤𝙪𝙧 𝙝𝙚𝙖𝙧𝙩?” “𝙄𝙩 𝙜𝙚𝙩𝙨 𝙖 𝙡𝙞𝙩𝙩𝙡𝙚 𝙤𝙪𝙩 𝙤𝙛 𝙘𝙤𝙣𝙩𝙧𝙤𝙡 𝙬𝙝𝙚𝙣 𝙄 𝙩𝙤𝙪𝙘𝙝 𝙮𝙤𝙪—𝙡𝙞𝙠𝙚 𝙞𝙩 𝙘𝙤𝙪𝙡𝙙 𝙚𝙭𝙥𝙡𝙤𝙙𝙚.”.Flint is such a beautiful complex man, on one hand he can’t stand how Ellen makes him feel, but he finds himself craving all the little things she does, like fixing his tie and suit for him like she can’t control her hands when she’s around him, or being there for his son when he’s not. Flint hates himself and what he did to his family he knows he deserves to be alone for the rest of life, only Ellen is so much stronger then he and she won’t let him get away that easy..Rating; 4.5🌟Steam; 4🔥\n\n', '\n\n  This book is just another example of why I love to read.  There are those special books that come into a reader’s life, the ones that tug at your heartstrings, pull you in, completely captivate you, and give you everything that you could have possibly hoped for in a book.  Look the Part was that book for me.  When I began reading it, I didn’t want to put it down.  When I wasn’t reading it, I was constantly thinking about the story and the characters and counting down the minutes until I would be able to return to this beautiful, all-consuming story.From beginning to end, this book owned my heart.  Look the Part is my definition of a well-rounded contemporary romance.  It just has it all.  It is filled with humor, great dialogue and banter, chemistry, tons of emotion, and that push and pull between the characters that offers up all of the tension that I enjoy.I felt an instant connection to the characters, not because my life mirrored theirs or because I shared their experiences, but because of the care that the author took in creating them.  They were real, emotional, flawed, and I was rooting for them from the very first page.  The whole cast of characters was done to perfection, each one adding their own special flair to the story.Whenever I read a book, I want to be invested in the characters and the story, but even more than that, I want to be able to feel everything that the characters are experiencing.  Well, I certainly felt this story.  From the laughter to the squeezing in my heart to the pangs in my stomach, I felt every bit of the joy, heartache, pain, need, and all of the love right along with them.  I wasn’t merely reading the words on the pages, I was living the story.I could go on and on about everything that I loved about Look the Part, but that would take too long.  I honestly can’t sing this book’s praises enough.  It is overflowing with heart, wit, and clever, flawless writing.  There aren’t too many books that I say this about, but I wish that I could read it again for the first time.\n\n', '\n\n  This is the first book I’ve read from this author and it was beautiful.  First she’s a good writer but she also offers the readers some jewels of wisdom.  The way she allows feelings to be felt and have their place is something us as women struggle with.  We often rush through our feelings and don’t lead with our hearts.  The plot also was not formulary or overly predictive which was nice.  As a mom of an autistic son, I appreciated her presentation of a family with an autistic child…as well as how she prefaced it at the start of the book.\n\n', '\n\n  This book is one of the best I’ve read in a long while. If I could, I would give it 10 🌟 no hesitation.  Jewel was a new author to me and I bought this book due to the 5 star rating and held on to it for a few months - don’t do that - read it immediately because this read is an experience.  This author just quickly climbed to my top 5 and I read atleast 250 books a year. This story follows Flint, Elle and Harry.  It is filled with so many funny experiences and light moments that I couldn’t put it down but, it also caused the “ugly” tears.  Those moments were quick, thank goodness, but I walked away feeling like I had been uplifted, and had learned a great deal.  It is emotional, but also fun and light; angsty and mysterious and suspenseful and simply wonderful.\n\n', ""\n\n  This book will take you through an emotional rollercoaster ride of emotions. One minute you will be laughing at the quick wit and humorous dialogue then the next you will be grabbing the tissue box as you bleed for the characters. One of Jewel E. Ann's many talents is creating unique characters you can't help but fall in love with, they're not perfect but they are perfectly flawed.If you love a book with all the feels then this is the book for you.\n\n"", '\n\n  I just can’t get enough of Jewel E Ann books. No matter the subject I know I will totally connect with the characters and feel all the feels during their journey.  Another amazingly told story.\n\n']"

The writing is like any other mature couple which I appreciated.It has a 2nd chance feel to it. They had one kiss years ago and then they never spoke of it for years even though they both still had it bad for each other. I love this trope and this did not disappoint.It also has that slight taboo/off limits feel. At the time of the first kiss they were step brothers living together. Now their parents are divorced but still stay in touch so there's that secretcy and wondering what will they think. It added a little suspense/slight drama/slight angst to the story. Though it's still a very low angst read.It is a holiday book in the sense that they are on Xmas break from school and there's a Christmas tree but it's a low key Christmas book. So even though this is releasing in Jan and some like myself may be over Xmas, you would still ver much enjoy this. It's just that melt your heart sweetness that is perfect regardless of the time. For the most part the story focuses on the 2 MCs thinking they are going to a family gathering only to end up being stuck in a cabin just the 2 of them for a week due to a blizzard and all that comes along with being stuck alone with the one you secretly still love.Both characters were so sweet. I loved them both and they had great chemistry together. This is a story I couldn't stop listening to. I loved the plot. It drew me in from start to finish. It's light, heartwarmingly sweet with some low heat. Great writing. I loved it and would definitely recommend the story.As for the narration, for me it was just ok. 3.5 stars. His voice was pleasant enough and kept good pace.  His tone/age suited the fact that the characters are college students. What I didn't like was that the voices weren't noticeablly different. Also, he definitely wasn't monotone but he didn't express the emotions as well as other narrators I've heard before.Note: There is also a freebie called Going the Distance and it's great too. A little extra about these 2 guys on Prolific Works.\n\n"", ""\n\n  This series just went from strength to strength! I loved the first book in this series. But the second book just took it to a whole new level.Quinn has certainly had a hard time of it. Losing a parent, having to deal with a new family when you're not even done processing the grief, struggling with school and an emotionally abusive boyfriend. But deep down, this character seemed to be one of the strongest. He just needed someone to help him see that... queue Jonas.Jonas uses his sexuality and frequent hookups as a shield for his true feelings.Now, bring them both together in a beautiful cabin on a snowed in mountain, and you get a steamy romance. But this book was so much more than this. The author took the time to show how Quinn and Jonas both dealt with their feelings and emotions - in order for this to truly work for them.I loved reading their story, and struggled to put it down! (Yes, D.J. Jamison - I'm blaming you for me still being up at 3am this morning because I had to finish the book) If you haven't read book 1 - start there. There is a brief reprise of two characters from book 1 in this book.

It was also hard for Jonas as he tried not to push himself in this person who was supposed to be his brother but he had a crush on, all while trying to get him back into living his life. Meeting again years later as adults while snowed in could have followed an expected path but was actually a lot about decisions made, the way life works out, self discovery, and love both familial and intimate. It really explored how hard it was for the kids of the families as they came together, trying to make something work when they each had reservations and expectations that drove them apart. It also looked into how having a crush on someone can be so different when you really get to know them, how it can change your view of a person and change the way things turn out.It also explored through decisions and consequences, and at what point it is your responsibility alone or if you can accept help of those who love and support you.

When their attraction was written in near the very end of the book, it felt forced, almost like an afterthought by the author.

It is a spin-off series of the Born in Blood Mafia Chronicles and the Camorra Chronicles. This duet is about the mafia princess Marcella Vitiello and the MC Maddox White.While I agree with many readers that this story did not need to be published as two different books, I do believe that Marcella and Maddox’s story was an excellent way to kick off the new series. The new generation may be bound by some rules but not to the extend their parents were, and after reading Maddox and Marcella’s story it is evident that the second generation will not have any issues breaking the rules.Marcella’s kidnapping in By Sin I Rise Part I has left scars behind – emotional and physical ones. However, Marcella does not let the kidnapping dominate her life but rather rises like a phoenix from the ashes. She is standing up for herself, her choices, her needs and wants, her desires, and most importantly she does not let anyone define her worth. She has suffered but she is anything far from broken. I really enjoyed her character a lot. While others wanted Marcella to have made more sacrifices to be in this relationship with Maddox, I loved that Maddox was the one to sacrifice everything to be with the woman he loved. This was very different in comparison to the previous books. Maddox and Marcella are passionate and have a fire, and nothing will keep these two apart.The highlight of the book for me was Maddox’s interactions with the Vitiello family and reading about old favorite characters. I really enjoyed reading about how Maddox slowly became part of the family.This book is a must-read if you have read By Sin I Rise Part I and if you are a Cora Reilly fan. Such as with her other books, Cora Reilly will pull you into this mafia universe that she has created, and you will not want the book to end.As usual, I cannot wait for next release!***This ARC was kindly provided to me by the author in exchange for an honest review.***\n\n', ""\n\n  I love ittttttttt.

Part two of By Sin I Rise picks up right where BSIR part one leaves off. I’m still not entirely sure how I feel about part two. I absolutely loved part one and all the chemistry, angst, and action but for some reason this novel has left me feeling a tad disappointed. I’ve been a fan of Cora for years now but for some reason BSIR part two didn’t wow me as I would have hoped, but with that being said it was still a wonderful conclusion to part one!Marcella is definitely Cora’s strongest heroine to date – she knows what she wants and always fights for it. I admired her strength and willingness to follow her heart always. Marcella’s character grew even more from the first book and watching her transition from her sheltered life into this strong bad ass women was so inspiring.Maddox’s character was conflicting for me, maybe it’s because I prefer a more broody and extreme hero whereas Maddox was sweet and caring and gave up everything for Marcella – which is completely admirable but at times I felt bad for him, why should he give up his entire life and all he’s ever known, and Marcella gives up nothing? Something about that just didn’t sit right with me, and to be honest he didn’t really feel like one of Cora’s signature bad boy heroes.I will say I’m beyond excited for Amo’s book and I hope he lives up to my expectations (being Luca’s son he has to, right?!) I’m very happy with the ending of this novel and how we got to see what happens after all the struggles to get to their happily ever after and I do look forward to seeing appearances of Marcella and Maddox in the next books!3.5⭐️𝘈𝘙𝘊 𝘳𝘦𝘤𝘦𝘪𝘷𝘦𝘥 𝘪𝘯 𝘦𝘹𝘤𝘩𝘢𝘯𝘨𝘦 𝘧𝘰𝘳 𝘢𝘯 𝘩𝘰𝘯𝘦𝘴𝘵 𝘳𝘦𝘷𝘪𝘦𝘸.\n\n', '\n\n  Wow, I didn’t know how this could work out and am completely happy on how it did!

He doesn’t conform, he doesn’t submit, he won’t toe the line, but he will do whatever he has to in order to be in Marcella’s world to be with her. Marcella is no slouch either, she grows up from the princess she was to the queen she is, all Vitiello and the perfect blend of her mother and father. The differences can’t keep these two apart, the bond between them too strong no matter the test. Both of these characters come into their own, are strong alone and invincible together. This is them figuring out how they will work in the world they have chosen to live in, and still be themselves.

Wait.Marcella and Maddox, their story completes with this book, although I thoroughly enjoyed it - it was just not as ""alpha-y"" as I was expecting being a Cora Reilly book. Marcella was more of the dominate in this book and it was a bit off-putting at times. That being said, the storyline was was perfect and paced well. I still binge read this baby and will definitely re-read it again in the future.Even though I knocked a star off, I still highly recommend Cora\'s work.\n\n']"

  #1 NEW YORK TIMES BESTSELLER • In her latest book, Brené Brown writes, “If we want to find the way back to ourselves and one another, we need language and the grounded confidence to both tell our stories and be stewards of the stories that we hear. This is the framework for meaningful connection.”In Atlas of the Heart, Brown takes us on a journey through eighty-seven of the emotions and experiences that define what it means to be human. As she maps the necessary skills and an actionable framework for meaningful connection, she gives us the language and tools to access a universe of new choices and second chances—a universe where we can share and steward the stories of our bravest and most heartbreaking moments with one another in a way that builds connection. Over the past two decades, Brown’s extensive research into the experiences that make us who we are has shaped the cultural conversation and helped define what it means to be courageous with our lives. Atlas of the Heart draws on this research, as well as on Brown’s singular skills as a storyteller, to show us how accurately naming an experience doesn’t give the experience more power—it gives us the power of understanding, meaning, and choice. Brown shares, “I want this book to be an atlas for all of us, because I believe that, with an adventurous heart and the right maps, we can travel anywhere and never fear losing ourselves.”   Read more  ","['5.0 out of 5 stars', '5.0 out of 5 stars', '5.0 out of 5 stars', '3.0 out of 5 stars', '5.0 out of 5 stars', '5.0 out of 5 stars', '4.0 out of 5 stars']","['\nA roadmap to a better self, not a book of answers, only you have answers with the provided map.\n', ""\nGoogle her, she'll change your life\n"", '\nBeautifully presented and written\n', '\nI like the book but it arrived damaged.\n', '\nA fabulous book.\n', '\nN/A\n', '\nA great resource for mapping emotions!\n']","['\n\n  Lets be open about how I see Brene Brown.  I have read all her books, many twice.  For those who know her other material you know you are going to cry at some point.  Those tears have always been about connections gained, lost or missed.I have purchased this book in its physical form which is well worth it because of the nature of its layout.  I have now purchased it on kindle for the purpose of further study and portability.  However also for the the additional purpose of leaving a review.  I want to leave a review because I see other reviews that are completely missing the point.  This book is a map not a book of answers.  Maps represent possibility it is up to you if you want to go on the adventure.  Your individuality and uniqueness make it impossible to find direct answers as to what you require to become whole.  You have to use the map and be willing to go on the journey.Now about the crying…Brene is getting closer to truths.  The other books two or three good bawls each.  This one I am now only one sixth completed and already have surpassed all the others.I am in the journey, following the map.  It is scary, painful, but in a certain way provides the elation of freedom after going through the pain.Thanks to Brene and her team for this.I have now finished the book over a two day read marathon.  My opinion of the content has not changed.  Still very positive.  As noted this becomes your own personal journey, I found it worthwhile and will re-read the book again very soon.  Yes, I found it that important.An interesting thing about the physical book and all it’s emotional content I found myself stroking the book and pages as if to make a connection with the book.

Years ago, when I first started trying to tune into my emotions I did research to compile a list of all known and named emotions and their definitions.  I used it to be more attuned to my feelings, and have used it to help my children and others do the same.  I wish this book would have been in print at that time.  Unlike the hyped expectations of some others which seemed to fall flat, I read just looking to see what was offered, and found it informative, touching, and beautiful.  This book will not save or fix your relationships, but it could help you follow the instructions of the emperor Trajan, “Know Thyself”.  I deducted a single star for Brenè’s justification of Joy in the “justice” of others’ wrong doing.  I realize she can’t help but have the western view of justice, but the ancient views of justice coupled with indigenous and other cultures’ beliefs show a much more ‘’connected” view of justice, where it’s objective is to reconcile the wrong doer and help them heal, rather than punish them.  I guess I was just surprised to see that slip up, given her focus and love of connection.  I’m glad she’s not writing a review of my life’s work, though.  I’m sure there would be many more incongruencies and flaws than I have found in hers.  All in all, a beautiful resource for assistance in emotional mapping.  I highly recommend it.\n\n']"

Shantel does a great job at building a well detailed foundation upon which Ryat and Blake's relationship is based. This foundation of the emotional growth in their relationship results in mind-blowing physical intimacy between them.

This is considered a DARK romance. Please keep that in mind when reading this book. I’m a huge fan of dark romance and even I found some of these kinks to be a bit extreme. While it may not be for everyone, the author is very respectful of both parties. Don’t rate a book poorly simply because the book is too dark. Know going in... this book will test your limits.Blakely is a junior at Barrington college. This is an elite private college for the children of the world’s wealthiest and most powerful families. Ryat is a senior at the college. Now that he’s passed all of his initiation tests, Ryat is inducted in as a Lord and is expected to select a woman to be his chosen one. The men are asked to abstain from sex until their senior year of college when they become Lords. As a gift for their sacrifice, they are gifted with a chosen one who will be their submissive.Ryat is asked to choose Blakely as his chosen one by the Lords. He starts off by stalking her and inserting himself into her life. When the time comes, Blakely willingly chooses to be with Ryat. Little did she know, that electing to be his chosen one would result in more than she bargained for. The twists and turns of this story will leave you on the edge of your seat.This story has some of the most taboo sex that I have ever read. The author explored forced sex fantasies, breath play, praise kinks among other things. Towards the end of the book… I couldn’t help become affected every time Ryat said “good girl”. Like I mentioned before, certain elements of this story are not my forte; however, the scenes were exceptionally well written. The female character’s best interests were always put first. The author goes on to say that a lot of these fantasies were Blakely’s and that women are often made to feel ashamed of their sexual desires and there is nothing wrong with consensual sex between two adults. I couldn’t put this book down.If you are a fan of dark taboo romance, then I feel like you’re going to enjoy this story. This is enough mystery and intrigue to keep you hooked until the very last line.I was provided an advanced reader copy in exchange for an honest review.\n\n', ""\n\n  It's been 24 hours and my head is still spinning. I read quite a bit of dark romance but this is my first secret society book and I loved it! It's so different from reading mafia or crime dark reads. Shantel put her magic to work and created a world that's so addictive to read that I was literally up until 4am reading. Here's a tip-don't start reading this one past 10pm because you will get sucked into the story, you will get sucked into the amazing characters and you will not be able to resist some of the hottest sex scenes I've ever read!The chemistry between Ryat and Blakely is there from the beginning but what starts as an obligation for him and a revenge tactic for her turns into something real, something that they can rely on and fight for outside of the all the secret society business. Their devotion to each other and the intensity of their feelings-it's just everything!Shantel has outdone herself and between all the heated moments is a story of intrigue, power and the ritualistic foundation that keeps it all going from generation to generation. I enjoyed all the layers of intricate details-the how's, the why's and eventually the WTF moments when things start falling into place.Triggers are aplenty and no, this is not a book for every romance reader but I still say going in blind is best for this one.Shantel has once again left me absolutely hot, bothered and extremely in awe of her talent to take dark romance to another mind-blowing level.\n\n""]"

Right? Hard work is defined by your own goals and ambitions (and not by how much time somebody else put in the work with 10X of your needs in life).The great thing about this book is that it can be applied not only to business but to personal productivity in general: In last few years, I managed to lower my working hours (I\'m a web developer; went from full-time to part-time) while increasing total salary (more than 3X) and launching my own small business (around online software).Just be aware, that this book is just a foundation to see new options in life and start asking a different kind of questions.

Here are my personal pros and cons regarding this book:PROS:-The Pareto rule discussed in this book can literally change your perception of so many things. It is for this reason alone, that I got my money’s worth of the book.-It changes your perception of money.-It helps you to READ better. This book took me a year approximately to read. But I didn’t read it for the purpose of simply reading it. I would read a couple of pages and spend a couple of days to a week pondering about the information and APPLYING it (this is so important)!-Time management help for those of us who can’t make up our minds, and waste so much of our lives.-The mindset that Ferris had towards product testing prior to releasing your product(s) is genius. I was originally wanting to purchase products and materials for my business right away but this book helped me to understand HOW I can test the waters with a smaller amount of money before expanding.-This book is perfect for EVERY college/university student. A great read on how to manage your time better while also learning to succeed in your business and/or career. For example, I started to spend just the minimal amount of time to get the best results possible. At the end of the day, a 4.0 for a student consists of a grade value between 85-100 and a student that gets ~85% is probably having a better life than the student who spends extra time on every assessment. And for what? Your 4.0 is assessed with the same view either way.-Essential for individuals who are starting a small business! Gives great outlines to how you can manage your finances better.CONS:-Certain parts of the book are really dry. Feel free to skip certain chapters. Not everything is useful for everyone.-The author has a LOT of unnecessary information. Most people will not be using most of the book's information in their daily lives.-Information on outsourcing is NOT a good idea for individuals of every profession. Out sourcing is not ideal for everyone, so please assess your situation carefully before going about this way. If you are in academia, and word gets around that you are outsourcing your job... you will MOST definitely be fired.-Over a third of the book is about outsourcing! Not necessary and it takes the reader so many chapters to get to a section that doesn't talk about outsourcing.\n\n"", ""\n\n  Total garbage... Was recommended this book by a few seemingly intelligent people I met at a party, so I thought I'd give it a read.

  In the vein of Naomi Novik’s New York Times bestseller Spinning Silver and Katherine Arden’s national bestseller The Bear and the Nightingale, this unforgettable debut— inspired by Hungarian history and Jewish mythology—follows a young pagan woman with hidden powers and a one-eyed captain of the Woodsmen as they form an unlikely alliance to thwart a tyrant. In her forest-veiled pagan village, Évike is the only woman without power, making her an outcast clearly abandoned by the gods. The villagers blame her corrupted bloodline—her father was a Yehuli man, one of the much-loathed servants of the fanatical king. When soldiers arrive from the Holy Order of Woodsmen to claim a pagan girl for the king’s blood sacrifice, Évike is betrayed by her fellow villagers and surrendered.  But when monsters attack the Woodsmen and their captive en route, slaughtering everyone but Évike and the cold, one-eyed captain, they have no choice but to rely on each other. Except he’s no ordinary Woodsman—he’s the disgraced prince, Gáspár Bárány, whose father needs pagan magic to consolidate his power. Gáspár fears that his cruelly zealous brother plans to seize the throne and instigate a violent reign that would damn the pagans and the Yehuli alike. As the son of a reviled foreign queen, Gáspár understands what it’s like to be an outcast, and he and Évike make a tenuous pact to stop his brother.  As their mission takes them from the bitter northern tundra to the smog-choked capital, their mutual loathing slowly turns to affection, bound by a shared history of alienation and oppression. However, trust can easily turn to betrayal, and as Évike reconnects with her estranged father and discovers her own hidden magic, she and Gáspár need to decide whose side they’re on, and what they’re willing to give up for a nation that never cared for them at all.   Read more  ","['3.0 out of 5 stars', '5.0 out of 5 stars', '5.0 out of 5 stars', '4.0 out of 5 stars']","['\nWas almost great\n', '\nUnforgetable\n', '\nOne of the best books I have ever read!!\n', ""\nA great read that I didn't want to put down\n""]","[""\n\n  I found that this book could have been great, could have been one of my favorites. It has fallen short for me however. I didn't mind that much of the book was slow paced, or that relationships weren't as deeply fleshed out as some other books. The lore was interesting when we got it, the characters were good and I didn't even mind the enemies to lovers romance (despite it not being my go to and more a thing I avoid). So for about 75% of this book I was having a great time. I read the entire novel in a few hours. But the ending was where it fell apart for me.The ending was rushed. Boy did everything happen fast. Which could have been fine, except the pacing of the entire rest of the book didn't match. It was paced more like a book in a series than a standalone. From what I could find via google this book isn't a series. I could be wrong, but it still makes no sense why the ending just suddenly happened. We spend the majority of the book on character growth (overcoming ingrained cultural hate and personal struggles) while they hunt for what is basically a macguffin. Which was all perfectly fine. I'm always up for a good macguffin when it is done right. The thing that was weird with this one? We go through so much pain and the main character pays the price for obtaining it and...the enemy just happens to be there. They just happen to catch them, and then one of the very bad dudes takes the macguffin. And...it is promptly forgotten. Seriously, this thing was not useful in the least. As far as I could tell, it got left on the table. Within a chapter or two, they manage to defeat the one who was set up as the big bad who was practically unkillable. Okay, cool. Except they do nothing differently? He just happens to die this time? Or did they hit his Achille's ankle no one knew he had? This still could have been saved had the rest of the ending not followed. Nothing becomes concrete, the main relationship is left open ended. The options given to them are crap and it leaves you with the feeling of 'this is as good as it gets'. It felt like the book was pointless. There was very little actual change that happened besides a small group of people's feelings to another group and a change of kings.It left me asking why I had read it, and being frustrated with how things turned out. Maybe it just wasn't my book, and that is fair. It wasn't bad, but it wasn't special either. And I shouldn't have to put this part in, but I feel like I should. You don't get to abuse someone for their entire life, treat them as disposable garbage, and then be redeemed for showing up. Just no. Your one semi good deed does not erase years of torment. You have to earn your redemption and that is not up to you. I get too that the victim can 'love' the abusers. But giving you the bare necessities of life so they can one day use you is not worthy of your love. Loyalty to your people and what they stand for? Sure. But the main character loves them? if the rest of the ending hadn't already ruined my mood this alone would have.It is a dark read that is full of abuse, self harm and sacrifice with very little pay off to make it worth it. I would still encourage you to give it a try as books are extremely subjective and it might be perfect to someone else. But if you are unsure in any way I would try a library first. Or a sale.\n\n"", ""\n\n  There are some books you can't put down. They catch you from your first breath and carry you away into the night until your eyes burn and fingers cramp. You are hopelessly enchanted. This is one such book. Every word, every phrase, lifts us upward into magic and a winter world that is at once both foriegn and yet familiar. Bravo Ava Reid, you are a master wordsmith. All I want to know is - when is the next book coming out?\n\n"", '\n\n  I just couldn’t put the book down. The world the author has created is so intricate. I could get lost in it forever.\n\n', '\n\n  Maybe it\'s because I\'ve been just slogging through some other fantasy-type stories lately, but I was blown away by how gripping The Wolf and the Woodsman\'s tale was from the very beginning. It didn\'t take a quarter of the book for me to ""get into it"". It was a very enjoyable read. If I have any gripes, it\'s that I did notice some repetitive phrases throughout. Things like fear or anger ""coiling in my chest"", for example - great imagery the first time, good the second time, and kind of lost meaning every time after that. So is it the BEST written book? Probably not, but the pace, action sequences, occasional creepiness (there\'s one monster in there that was absolutely terrifying to read at 2 a.m.), even the political intrigue and religious allegories made the entire book well worth reading.\n\n']"

  #1 NEW YORK TIMES BESTSELLER • Jack Reacher is back in a brand-new page-turning thriller from acclaimed #1 bestselling authors Lee Child and Andrew Child.Digging graves had not been part of my plans when I woke up that morning. Reacher goes where he wants, when he wants. That morning he was heading west, walking under the merciless desert sun—until he comes upon a curious scene. A Jeep has crashed into the only tree for miles around. A woman is slumped over the wheel. Dead? No, nothing is what it seems. The woman is Michaela Fenton, an army veteran turned FBI agent trying to find her twin brother, who might be mixed up with some dangerous people. Most of them would rather die than betray their terrifying leader, who has burrowed his influence deep into the nearby border town, a backwater that has seen better days. The mysterious Dendoncker rules from the shadows, out of sight and under the radar, keeping his dealings in the dark. He would know the fate of Fenton’s brother. Reacher is good at finding people who don’t want to be found, so he offers to help, despite feeling that Fenton is keeping secrets of her own. But a life hangs in the balance. Maybe more than one. But to bring Dendoncker down will be the riskiest job of Reacher's life. Failure is not an option, because in this kind of game, the loser is always better off dead.

Perhaps Child's son had read too much about Hemingway, and thought fragments were manly.  I don't know.  At several points, the main writer (presumably the son) lost track of matters such as the time of day, the amount of daylight, and so on. In addition, the book was written in the first person--not a great idea for a Jack Reacher book, since it limits perspective too greatly. I'll never buy another collaboration with the kid.

This is the same. Yawn. I find myself skipping entire paragraphs of redundant or boring prose about what the parking lot looks like in minute detail like he’s killing off pages to be filled. Been this way for a few books. This first person view on this book removed mystique of the character - not enhanced it. Somewhere around book 7 I noticed a larger change like he’s got his mom writing them. I could go into detail of the elements of excitement that changed but why bother. Have you noticed Reacher became asexual 6 books ago. There’s no romantic aspect at all. Did Lee get impotence and now his character is also celibate? Kind of done with this series. This book is particularly bad. High school level writing. That’s a shame\n\n', '\n\n  I’ve read all of Lee Childs books and I  would rate this one close to the bottom of the list. It’s story line is weak and unbelievable in parts, such as. Example, your partner gets his head blown off by a woman and you want to have sex with her before you shoot her. Come on you can do better Lee. The description of all the tunnels becomes monotonous and only takes up space. Lots of tunnels but save us from the boredom of mentioning every turn, it accomplishes nothing. We get it, lots of tunnels. I could go on but I’ve made my point. I’m disappointed. You may be “better off” not to read this one.\n\n', ""\n\n  The setup is seriously confusing. The dialog is stilted, and should not be first person as that emphasizes the poor dialog.

The blue-eyed man sitting next to me, even better. He was suave and intelligent. We talked and laughed, and something clicked. Fate took over and the plane was grounded, and we had an unexpected stopover for the night.With no plans, we made our own. We danced and laughed our way around Boston and had a night of crazy passion that no woman would ever forget. That was twelve months ago, and I haven’t heard from him—until today. I started a new job and met the CEO. You can imagine my surprise to see those naughty blue eyes dance with delight when he saw me across the mahogany desk. But I’m not that carefree girl anymore. My life has changed, I have responsibilities. I just got an email. He wants to see me in his office for a private meeting at 8:00 a.m. Naughty blue eyes have no place in the workplace.

I didn’t even know you could get refunds on books, but this is one I applied for. I got 39% and had enough. Normally I try to trudge through a book because I hate not finishing, but this felt like I was wasting my time.Where to begin?Well the characters might be bipolar. Or they have zero idea how to interact like civilized adults. The way they ripped into each other and tore the other one down was basically a toxic relationship. Now, I’m the first to admit I’m not some feminist that wants women to be treated a specific way and I’ve read plenty of books with a dominant male. But Jameson isn’t a hot alpha male with dominant tendencies. He’s an overgrown child who treats women like crap. The female protagonist isn’t any better and acts like a victim even though she’s equally as ignorant and annoying. Hopefully I’ll get a refund so I can put it towards something I actually might enjoy.\n\n', '\n\n  I enjoyed this story as I do all of TL Swan’s books.  It kept me entertained and turning the pages.  The story is fast -paced and the author dives right in.  I still have no real idea what Jay’s problem was when he so cruelly cut things off - I didn’t understand the author’s reasons nor did I think it made much sense so that was frustrating.  After reading Mr. Masters which I loved I thought this book was a little choppy and did’t flow.  Don’t get me wrong, I have given it 4 stars and I can’t wait for this author’s work, I just found the angst so over the top and the reasons behind it vague.  With Masters you completely understand  each person’s upset, anger and heartbreak but for this book, I didn’t get it, especially in relation to the deep heartbreak.  I do enjoy her books though, regardless but I must say that I absolutely HATE the bold text the author uses for the male POV!  It is awful, bothersome, difficult to read, and frustrating.  It spoils the read, especially if you have the text a little bigger.  It really was like reading someone shouting at you, pages and pages at a time.  I hated it! This is a common format choice for the author but it is not a pleasant way to read a book.  The author may not realize that the degree of boldness is not changeable by the reader.  Depending on the reading app, the size of text and font the boldness is just horrific! And I hate it!\n\n', '\n\n  You would think by the title this book would be all about the sex. In truth it is a very compelling love story with really good love scenes. Ok, they get pretty steamy lol, but the love the main characters feel is present.

Our first in the series, has hot sex, angst, a great story that unfolds forever and keeps you page turning, exes that get in the way. Jameson and Emily meet as a one night stopover!! It could be corny that she ends up working for him but the story moves forward in directions you never guess and Emily ends up solving the crime. While Jameson is stunted abit as a “relationship” person the camping chapter had me laughing out loud! I love that you delivered a great first book story with a lot of foundation for the future brothers! While Emily gets a little droney at times you can see why it does mirror real life “with your girlfriends discussing all the gossip”... I cannot wait for brother number 2 and am so glad you let us have our happy ending...it was hard fought!!\n\n', '\n\n  TL Swan does it again with another hot read. A continuous roller coaster of emotions that left me rooting for Jameson and Emily to be together and then in the next moment, wanting to smack him up the side of the head! It was such a page turner that I read non-stop...\n\n', ""\n\n  3.5 StarsIn the last few months, T.L. Swan's books were highly recommended by fellow readers on social medias. I finally decided to see what all the hype was about and read my first book from this author. The Stopover was an okay read for me with some great moments and others that kind of diminished my overall appreciation of the story.At first, I really enjoyed the banter between Emily and Jameson. The push and pull was interesting and their chemistry intense. After a while though, I felt it was redundant between them and sometimes both heroes acted juvenile. Despite these little critics, I enjoyed the overall plot that kept me reading until the end.I'll definitely check out the next books in the Miles High Club Series, because I'm intrigued about the other Miles brothers.\n\n"", ""\n\n  I wish I could give this more stars.  It is a fantastic read.  T L Swan does not disappoint.  Jameson and Emily are very well developed characters.  I giggled  and laughed all the way thru the camping chapter.  Then the drama came and I was so invested in the story that I couldn't put it down.  I loved this story and will read it again this week.  It is worth the time it takes to read it, you won't be sorry.  It is too good a story to give away any of the plot lines.  Please give it a try, you will love this book as much as I did.\n\n"", '\n\n  Then this is a must read, I couldn’t put it down!

  Secrets of the Millionaire Mind reveals the missing link between wanting success and achieving it!Have you ever wondered why some people seem to get rich easily, while others are destined for a life of financial struggle? Is the difference found in their education, intelligence, skills, timing, work habits, contacts, luck, or their choice of jobs, businesses, or investments?The shocking answer is: None of the above!In his groundbreaking Secrets of the Millionaire Mind, T. Harv Eker states: ""Give me five minutes, and I can predict your financial future for the rest of your life!"" Eker does this by identifying your ""money and success blueprint."" We all have a personal money blueprint ingrained in our subconscious minds, and it is this blueprint, more than anything, that will determine our financial lives. You can know everything about marketing, sales, negotiations, stocks, real estate, and the world of finance, but if your money blueprint is not set for a high level of success, you will never have a lot of money—and if somehow you do, you will most likely lose it! The good news is that now you can actually reset your money blueprint to create natural and automatic success.Secrets of the Millionaire Mind is two books in one. Part I explains how your money blueprint works. Through Eker's rare combination of street smarts, humor, and heart, you will learn how your childhood influences have shaped your financial destiny. You will also learn how to identify your own money blueprint and ""revise"" it to not only create success but, more important, to keep and continually grow it.In Part II you will be introduced to seventeen ""Wealth Files,"" which describe exactly how rich people think and act differently than most poor and middle-class people. Each Wealth File includes action steps for you to practice in the real world in order to dramatically increase your income and accumulate wealth.If you are not doing as well financially as you would like, you will have to change your money blueprint. Unfortunately your current money blueprint will tend to stay with you for the rest of your life, unless you identify and revise it, and that's exactly what you will do with the help of this extraordinary book. According to T. Harv Eker, it's simple. If you think like rich people think and do what rich people do, chances are you'll get rich too!

I\'m sure this book helps some people, but religion helps some people too.  The author prays on a few human flaws to sell his seminars advertised by this book. Those flaws are: confirmation bias, belief in meritocracy, needing to feel special, the need/desire to believe in something bigger than oneself, anxiety about randomness of life, and needing a sense of purpose and order in the chaotic nature of life.So, the author focuses on the concept that being poor or rich has to do with state of mind. Wealth attracts wealth, and poverty attracts more poverty, and so on. Author claims that rich people are more generous givers, which I have no idea where he gets this from. Social studies confirm that in general, lower income people are the ones more likely to be more compassionate, willing to help and give higher percentage of their income to charity than the wealthy. He creates a sort of aura around wealthy people and encourages the reader to worship them, that maybe one day, by worshipping them they will become like them. Worship the gods, because one day they might just make you one of them. Lol.Just like The Secret, this book is a mantra to a cult where the belief that if you change the way you think or how you see the world and how you interact with it, you will be happier. Which I guess is true, but then it depends on what you want in life.If all you want in life is to have a spouse and a child (most common goal of a majority of middle-class women), there is a great probability that this may actually happen; even if it may seem hard to find ""a spouse"" and unless you suffer from infertility, you probably can find a partner and become a parent at some point in life. So, then if that happens, you get the spouse and child you wanted, you read this book, you say, hey the book really helped me. That is just confirmation bias.If you dream big, you have to take some risks in life. For example, if you want to make money with high-risk investments, you need to be prepared to fail as well, and this book is not for you. You actually need to read  and understand how stock markets work. That is getting real financial education. People who become wealthy from nothing, usually worked really hard, failed and rose up again. They did not read a book of wishful thinking, pretended to be rich and a million-dollar idea came to them in a dream. Well, maybe there is one person this happened to, but it not highly probable.If your goal is something unattainable, like winning the lottery, there is great probability it will not happen because very few people do win the lottery, so you have to be realistic to lower your expectations from life to actually get something that is reachable from where you sit. This creates confirmation bias, and sadly people cannot see it and don’t admit that about themselves. They just say “ I don’t want lottery winnings; I don’t need it” .”Grapes are sour” said the fox when she could not reach them.According to this book, if you want to win the lottery, you just need to wish it, pretend you are rich, worship the rich, act like them, pretend you’re one of them, and you don’t even have to buy the lottery ticket, it will come to you as a gift because of your positive thinking.Many people want to be right; they want to feel lucky and they want to feel that the universe, or God, thinks they are special and they don’t want to accept that life is just random and that we are really just tiny insignificant specks of dust in the great scheme of the infinite universe.People like to believe in meritocracy: I have what I have because I deserve it. I worked hard for it, and to some reading books such as this, means working hard for what they attain. Rich people are rich because they deserve it. I am not rich because I probably don’t deserve it. I have high degrees and a high paying job because I deserve it. So on. A lot of things are just random, like opportunities in life, accidents, violent crime victims,  for instance.It is true though that unhealthy envy is wasted energy, a good dose of healthy envy is what people need to try harder to attain their goals. This is true of course, but I don’t need to buy this book to know that. I can just read an article on Psychology today for free.\n\n', ""\n\n  This book contains great information about how different classes of people view money. I have learned a lot and have taken action and it has changed my live. However,,,,The author talks about his seminars ever chance he gets, its almost as if once he finishes explaining something he just has to tell you about his seminar. The problem with this is that it makes the reader think they are dependent on going to this seminar and won't get rich if they don't.\n\n"", ""\n\n  The approach of the author in this book is really different and unique from other books with similar topic out there. It is certainly changing my perspective towards money in a very positive way and it is also is teaching me strategies and techniques to easily attract money into your life.I'm really enjoying reading it, and I definitely recommend it!\n\n"", '\n\n  I read this book because of a recommendation from a colleague and I have found that the truth and wisdom on it is not only applicable to money, but also to your relationships.I have bought additional copies to share with others as well as an audio version to listen to while I’m driving.If you take his advice (even if it feels a little silly at first - new things do often seem weird), and do what he says, this book can change your life.  It’s up to you!\n\n', '\n\n  fantastic book. Some people may think of this as just a ""feel good"" book, and your right, it is exactly that and no more if you do not do any of the actions Harv suggests you do. he offers many ""wealth principles"" and ""wealth files"" which to me, hold so much value. Awesome book if you can apply his advice to your life; but your a dreamer if you think after reading this book, money is going to fall in your lap.\n\n', ""\n\n  Well structured and easy to read. Some content is not new if you have read other popular books on self-help but this book stillstands out and you will enjoy it if you don't try to be too critical. Lots of good advice to follow.

  A USA Today and Wall Street Journal bestseller.An uneasy alliance between warring families gets heated in this otherworldly novella from bestselling author Ilona Andrews.At first glance, the planet Rada seems like a lush paradise. But the ruling families, all boasting genetically enhanced abilities, are in constant competition for power—and none more so than the Adlers and the Baenas. For generations, the powerful families have pushed and pulled each other in a dance for dominance.Until a catastrophic betrayal from within changes everything.Now, deadly, disciplined, and solitary leaders Ramona Adler and Matias Baena must put aside their enmity and work together in secret to prevent sinister forces from exploiting universe-altering technology.

  The 1948 crime film The Naked City (later a television show) ended with this iconic line There are eight million stories in the naked city.” Things have not changed either before or since: every era and neighborhood is full of true tales and legends about which even residents are likely to be unaware. Strange And Obscure Stories Of New York City takes the reader on a breathtaking tour of the five boroughs in search of these accounts. Some are eerily fascinating in their own right while others explain how the city became the great metropolis that it is.Before the World Trade Center 9/11 tragedy, the aftermath of a fire aboard the steamboat General Slocum in the East River was the city’s greatest disaster. The 1904 event occurred during an outing for a church group. The loss of life1,021 out of the 1,358 passengersdevastated the German-America community that inhabited Manhattan’s East Village. To escape bad memories, they relocated to the Upper East Side’s Yorkville, the reason why that neighborhood became celebrated for its German restaurants, stores, and breweries.On July 23, 1886, not long after the Brooklyn Bridge opened, a 23-year-old named Steve Brodie announced that he survived a 150-foot drop from that span into the East River. (A liquor dealer offered to back a saloon that Brodie wanted to open but only if he took the risk). Although there were no witnesses, news of the alleged jump made headlines, with The New York Times supporting Brodie’s claim, and the phrase pull a Brodie,” meaning to try a dangerous stunt, entering popular parlance.Then too are the unsolved murders, ghost stories, urban legends (are there indeed alligators living in the sewers?), and hidden histories that are all part of this lively and captivating chronicle of the world’s greatest city.Skyhorse Publishing, as well as our Arcade imprint, are proud to publish a broad range of books for readers interested in history--books about World War II, the Third Reich, Hitler and his henchmen, the JFK assassination, conspiracies, the American Civil War, the American Revolution, gladiators, Vikings, ancient Rome, medieval times, the old West, and much more.

Tristian Miles is such an amazing character - he’s definitely swoon material.  This book is filled to the brim with romance but there are also some laugh out loud moments.

Swan has done it again, this women makes me laugh, swoon, feel immense passion and emotion that I’m convinced she cannot write a bad book! I absolutely adored this story!.Our heroine Claire is a widow with three wonderful kids she doesn’t have time for love or a relationship, what she had with her husband is unforgettable she misses him dearly and everyday seems to be harder, he should be here. Helping her. Now on the verge of bankruptcy her husbands company is falling under she catches the eye of Tristan the biggest business Mogul who takes company’s and rips them apart then builds them back up again. She hates him. He’s cocky, conceited and she doesn’t want him anywhere near her husbands company, especially when one look from him makes her stomach sink, and her body come alive she knows it’s a bad idea. She does not need him in her life in anyway, but Tristan is not so easily deterred..“𝙃𝙚 𝙧𝙪𝙨𝙝𝙚𝙨 𝙢𝙚 𝙖𝙣𝙙 𝙜𝙧𝙖𝙗𝙨 𝙢𝙮 𝙛𝙖𝙘𝙚 𝙞𝙣 𝙝𝙞𝙨 𝙝𝙖𝙣𝙙𝙨 𝙖𝙣𝙙 𝙠𝙞𝙨𝙨𝙚𝙨 𝙢𝙚.

And what he wants is Claire. There is definitely more than meets the eye when it comes to her and he wants to take his time getting under the surface and getting her under him. So when fate sends them to the same conference in Paris this is the perfect time to test this mutual attraction.

Leona’s homestead is dusted with snow, her beloved grandchildren are visiting, and her connection with Sheriff Eli Ramirez is sweeter than a cup of hot cocoa.But when her Grinchy ex-husband shows up on her front porch, all the holiday cheer flies the coop. He’s not just there to ruin her new life. Worse, he wants her back. And he’s counting on a little Christmas magic to help him do it. Eager to put coal in his stocking, Leona arranges a visit with Santa. But when Old Saint Nick pegs her ex for the naughty list, it more than ruffles his feathers. And when Santa is found “sleighed” after their frosty fistfight, her ex becomes the prime suspect in the killing. Now Eli’s not just competing against him for Leona’s heart. He’s also investigating him for murder. And Leona’s unwelcome guest is extending his stay—unless she can uncover the truth of what happened there under the mistletoe and send him packing to jail…or at the very least, back to LA. Can Leona and Eli crack the case in time for Christmas? Or will their holiday goose be cooked?

I hate it when writers think their audience is stupid and write characters whose actions are so ridiculous that they are impossible to believe. Let's put aside the fact that the heroine takes constant crap from her family and says absolutely nothing about it. Let's also ignore the fact that anything to deal with romance throughout the book reads like badly scripted porn - really, really bad porn. The fact that Hunter who was a marine and co-founder of a security company is so blind that he cannot see what is so clearly in front of his face is just plain ridiculous. No one in charge of a billion dollar company is that stupid even if they have taken a 12 year hiatus to raise a child - another ridiculous point. Most parents work while raising their children, and are able to come to a nice home/work balance.  They also manage to accomplish this without an 8 figure bank account. I managed to read 67% of the book and then rushed to the end. There is only so much I can take before throwing in the towel.

I loved how diverse and how complex each of the sisters’ characters were. You could feel their pain and their confusion come right off the pages of this brilliant novel. I honestly kept checking how many pages were left because I did not want the story to end. The emotions of the characters were so real, and I could just sit back and imagine what each sister was going through. I also loved their grandmothers’ story and how it was told throughout the book. I was so excited for what she would share next of her journey through the war and how she came to America. I would have loved this to be a three part book series on each sister so I could stay with their stories a little longer. This is one book you do not want to miss.

I'd had a rough week and needed a happy read. THIS WAS IT.It's like the grumpy-sunshine, enemies to lovers, forced proximity rom com that everyone needs in their lives.While this book may be a slow burn, the tension is electric, their connection (while oblivious to Lina) is obvious throughout, and when they FINALLY get to it.. they are EXPLOSIVE and HOT and it is steamy. But even reading their tension is steam inducing.It gave off BIG Fat Greek Wedding vibes, crossed with The Wedding Date and a sprinkling of Jim and Pam of the office.There is SO much to unpack in this book, in SUCH a good way. I truthfully thought that her family looked down on her because of her past experience dating her professor and her unsuccessful dating history since then. But it wasn't until her father lovingly called her an earthquake that I realized their concern was based out of love and wanting to see her happy .Then there is Lina's past history with her professor and the rumors that swirled around her and plagued her and made her feel so much less than she was. And the professor gave zero sh*ts about her feelings.The paralell (spoiler!!) That happens with thus scenario at the end of the book is just *chefs kiss!*And do NOT even get me started on Gerald. He infuriated me so much that when my husband interrupted me mid-read I actually snapped at him. I had to take a moment to realize that I was mad at Gerald and not my actual life.Aaron and Lina were just this great modern couple tackling such REAL life issues. Aaron is the kind of man that men should aspire to be! A supportive, caring partner who treats a woman as his equal and lifts her up\n\n"", '\n\n  I think this book was figging fantastic, it had me crying, laughing cringing 💀. I even through my phone across the room and dented the wall :/ but nevertheless it was so much fun I LOVE FREAKING AARON and Lina (ofc) but I think this man has a holddd one me. this book had it moments ( cringe dirty talk but whatever) however I loved the writing the niche references really did it for me. OU AND THE TENSION. TOP.TIER. the characters especially Lina felt realistic with there struggles and not push to force drama. Also the family in the book was 😘, the blatant love between everyone was perfect I could feel it through the book.

There has only been a few books that have fulfilled my expectations and “The Spanish Love Deception” is now added to this list.This story made me cringe, laugh out loud, giggle, and made my heart ache and rejoice throughout the story.The two main characters (Catalina and Aaron) were so much fun to read about that I could totally imagine this book as a movie.I want to read it again to savor the characters and cheer them on.Thanks to the author, Elena Armas, for bringing to life to heartwarming story of Catalina and Aaron.  It was Perfection!\n\n', '\n\n  This was a great fake dating, office enemies to lovers romance. I thought that Lina was hilarious. The book had me laughing from the first few pages. I love the witty banter between Aaron and Lina. I found the book to be somewhat of a slow burn. The author really makes you wait for the couple to get together. Overall this was a really good book. I would recommend it to those who enjoy romantic comedies.The best part of the book was every time Aaron would call Lina ""baby""...swoon.\n\n', '\n\n  Okay wow! Lina & Aaron!! I’m obsessed, and this book was incredible. This is an enemies-to-lovers, fake-dating romance and my gosh, it’s perfect. This is a slow burn and it’s SO worth it. It’s a fairly large book and I read it in two days. The writing quality of the author made this book so easy to devour.Catalina Martin is an engineer team lead at a firm in NYC. She desperately needs a date for her sisters wedding back in Spain where all her family is. In walks the 6’4 blue-eyed pain in her ass co-worker, Aaron Blackford. He inserts himself as her only option. But he’s the bane of her existence. This can’t go right, can it?Please run to read this. It’s SO good! PLUS, the author just announced she is working on a second book for one of the side characters, Lina’s best friend, Rosie! Give me all the steamy-romancy-bickering-love. I’m hooked.\n\n', '\n\n  I was looking for a slow burn contemporary multi-cultural romance and wow, did this book deliver!The slow evolution of the relationship burned so hot!  The characters are lovely and the mix of American and Spanish brings an interesting flavor to the story.  It’s also funny.I highly recommend it.  Expect to not be able to put it down once you start.  It’s that good.\n\n', ""\n\n  I was super excited to read this book because of all the great reviews, but I was quickly disappointed within the first five pages. It takes four pages for the main character to just simply turn around and I can't think of any point in the novel where I was actually enjoying it. If this hadn't been the book my book club selected, I probably would have stopped reading long ago. Plot is similar to Hating Game, but carries none of the enjoyable qualities. The main character, Catalina, has long drawn out thoughts that cover pages and simple conversations take forever to be finished. There are a lot of plot holes or points that never get brought up again. Way too many cliches that doesn't really work in the favour of the book or its characters. Honestly, this book could have been condensed into 200-300 pages instead of the 400 something that it is. The 'problem' in the novel isn't focused on enough to even feel sympathy towards the MC, and only adds to the annoyance of the reader. Really tried my all to enjoy it but can't say i did at all.\n\n""]"

I definitely went in search for a lipstick just like that.Onto the book… Sheridan has done it again. After needing to recover from that book one  cliffhanger I dove right into this book the minute it hit my Kindle. Those first few chapters… My heart just didn’t know how to feel. I was a mix of emotions, especially after getting to know the characters in book one.As the story continues I thought my emotions were beginning to settle (spoiler alert, probably not smart). We finally got little glimpses of the guys pasts, which I had been waiting for. There were some big moves being made and, of course, some twists and turns. I’m not sure if the ending was a complete shock because we were given a few hints earlier in the book. However, I think it was a pretty decent emotional cliffhanger. I think that when the events are revealed to the other characters it’s going to be explosive.This book’s release date was brought up earlier than planned and I can’t help hope that book 3 might be as well (hopeful thinking but no pressure of course). Sheridan is great at dragging you into her books and slowly letting you go in pieces. Definitely one of my 1-Click authors.\n\n', ""\n\n  Oh my goodness! We're only on book 2 of 4 and Sheridan is serving up a whole darn FEAST. If bow was the debut, then Depraved Sinners is only further evidence of her way to mastery in the dark RH romance genre.I am so impressed with the plot, the action, and the sheer DEPTH of these characters. Just when you think you couldn't dislike a character any more than you did in the first book, BAM! A drop of backstory that leaves you hanging and confused about your newfound affections... looking at a certain dark and Depraved male character...There is so much to unpack with this book, especially after the cliffy from book one. Sheridan hits the ground running in the beginning of Heathens and ends things on an even larger scale cliffhanger that made me simultaneously want to curse her and kiss her feet for the absolute genius (and diabiloical) events.Overall, I think this is quickly shaping up to be my favourite series!\n\n"", ""\n\n  My brain needed a minute after that ending because of all the things I thought would happen this wasn't even on my radar! Heathens picks up where Psychos finishes and I can honestly say I'm glad nothing was missed or unturned while writing book 2.The development of the DeAngelis brothers was so captivating and intense I loved the moments they showed how vulnerable and real they are.The fact that their past was actually spoken about and not brushed under the rug made me so emotionally attached I just devoured all of it.The development of each character and how they choose to present themselves makes me want to be right there with them for every messed up twist and turn Sheridan throws at them.The story line of this book was darker and I honestly loved seeing this side of Sheridan's writing abilities.Honestly my undying love for Marcus is untouchable and he's pretty high up on my book boyfriend list and I'm ready for the rest of the redemption in book 3.\n\n"", '\n\n  I feel completely and utterly wrecked after finishing this book! I feel like Sheridan truly loves to torture her readers. My heart was in my throat through the entire book. It’s like sitting in a hurricane and waiting for the wind to tear your house apart.

My original cliffhanger was answered but of course she does me dirty with another cliffhanger but that’s why I love her writing so much.The story continues with Shayne being her bad ass self. Like she is a bad ass mother “trucking” girl. She learns more about the DeAngelis brothers.

  An AMAZON TOP 50 BESTSELLER!Can you keep a secret?⁣I grew up sick.⁣⁣Let me clarify.⁣⁣I grew up believing that real love stories include a martyr or demand great sacrifice to be worthy.⁣⁣Because of that, I believed it, because I made myself believe it, and I bred the most masochistic of romantic hearts, which resulted in my illness.⁣⁣When I lived this story, my own twisted fairy tale, it was unbeknownst to me at the time because I was young and naïve. I gave into temptation and fed the beating beast, which grew thirstier with every slash, every strike, every blow.⁣⁣Triple Falls wasn’t at all what it seemed, nor were the men that swept me under their wing. But in order to keep them, I had to be in on their secrets.⁣⁣Secrets that cost us everything to keep.⁣⁣That’s the novelty of fiction versus reality. You can’t re-live your own love story, because by the time you’ve realized you’re living it, it’s over. At least that was the case for me and the men I trusted my foolish heart to.⁣⁣Looking back, I’m convinced I willed my story into existence due to my illness.⁣⁣And all were punished.This trilogy is a gritty, modern day take on Robin Hood.

Sean introduces her to his crowd and she meets Sean's best friend Dom.I'm not going to give any additional plot or spoilers as I believe it is better to go in blind and giving away details takes away from the reading experience.My advice - READ this book.

He invites her to a party at his house where she meets one of his roommates, Dominic.  This is the start of a relationship between the three of them which gets more intricate and mysterious every day.

The only suspense comes in the form of a ""secret"" that really isn\'t that thrilling.  I don\'t know.  From someone who\'s read many books of higher level reading and intensity such as LOTR, Dune, Ender\'s Game, etc.... I just don\'t get the hype.  There\'s really not a lot of plot.  There\'s a non thrilling secret and lots of sex.  Just ""eh"".  Read Nora Roberts instead for a thriller romance.\n\n', '\n\n  This story draws you in from the very beginning.

Can’t wait to continue the story in Exodus, especially after that radical cliffhanger!\n\n', '\n\n  This story had me hooked since page 1 even though I was confused. I love the characters and the way Kate has brought them to life. They all felt real and the romance was just chef’s kiss.

GeissingerSloane has a sister?!?  I didn’t quite know what to do with this new revelation! Sloane has a younger sister and the biggest traits they share are button pushing and their very warped, very funny, very wordy sense of humor. Just imagine the two of them in the same room….I’m warning you be prepared!Riley is somewhat of a recluse, geesh she has Sloane for a sister, of course she would be. However, that doesn’t stop her from giving you her opinion and I’m not sure who told her to use her words, as she does that in spades. Savage Hearts could actually flow right over into romantic comedy at some points. The action starts as Riley arrives for a visit with Sloane and Declan. This is where the story really begins.From a blonde haired Irishman named Spider to a “Ghost” who appears to be able to walk through walls, Riley has one heck of a journey beginning.Beloved (well maybe only by Natalie) Kage has decided to send an assassin Declan’s way. Such a nice man! NOT! This is how we meet Malek; his mission to “remove” Declan, who was responsible for Malek’s brother’s death. However, his first meeting with Riley kinda sends him for a loop.Sit yourself down and get comfortable, Malek and Riley are one of those opposites attract couples, Riley also brings something new to Malek’s life, hope, inspiration and maybe he will learn that forgiveness can help heal past hurts.We get to visit with Sloane and Declan of course, Spider (who is Riley’s bodyguard) Kage and Natalie and a Russian Pakhan, a crow and there might be a bear.What we get story wise is priceless; lots of humor, surprises, safe houses, traveling and show down that could blow this story wide open. I loved every minute, every laugh, the odd tear and being a part of what one person named Riley could show our Monsters! On top of this we find out who our next Monster will be.\n\n', '\n\n  I can’t get enough of this series! This book was surprising and a real turning point in the series.Riley has been summoned for a visit by her almost estranged sister and when she arrives she’s thrust into a world of crime and lavish lifestyle she’s never seen before. Turns out that’s what happens when your sister is involved with the Irish Mob.Malek is seeking vengeance for his brother’s death and comes across Riley along the way. He’s the ultimate killer who everyone fears but he can’t turn away from Riley.Riley made this book for me. She’s a spitfire and the banter between her and Malek was top notch. She gave as good as she got and had real inner strength.Their chemistry is undeniable and intense. the sex scenes are so hot, as expected from the extremely talented J.T. Geissinger.This was a captivating read with lots of details that sometimes left my mind spinning but they’re all there for a reason. I feel like this book is setting the tone and direction for the series as a whole. Certain storylines got tied up and seeds for new ones have been planted. I cannot wait for the next book!!! Spider has been an important character for two books now and he definitely deserves to find his true crime partner.\n\n', '\n\n  I agree with all of the other reader’s comments about Mal & Riley - LOVE THEM, especially Riley. She is an interesting character! The storyline was intriguing & kept you hooked. I did not want to put this book down. I also enjoyed the way Ms Geissinger brought other characters back: Kage, Nat, Declan, Sloane & Killian! It was interesting how they appeared & we got their perspectives throughout the book. Also, big thanks for the summary Nat & Sloane gave to Riley - that helped refresh the previous books & provided a bit of the forgotten history. This is an excellent book & I cannot wait to read ‘Brutal Vows’ & Spider’s adventure(s). Highly recommend this book, but it must be read in order to fully understand the storyline.\n\n', ""\n\n  Savage Hearts is the third book in the Queens & Monsters series. It follows Riley and Malek. There's a little miscommunication between them at the start of the book, which was so funny! It really set the tone of the book. Riley has been living in the shadows of her prettier and more popular sister, so she's always felt like insecure about her looks. Malek is out for revenge, but when he sees Riley his whole mission is derailed. I won't give it away but this book so much fun, and the spice was on fire! Highly recommend!\n\n"", '\n\n  Not going to lie didn’t really warm up to Riley till atleast half way through.  Riley is a know it all who assumes if you don’t talk in three syllable words you’re dense.  Mal is not the typical Bratva soldier and I loved it. I also enjoyed the semi love triangle. It’s most definitely a slow burn but when we do get to the scenes it’s all kinds of hot. This of course isn’t the end to this series and I’m so ready for the next story in this mobs/mafia/bratva saga.\n\n', '\n\n  This is the third book of the Queens & Monsters series, I read the other two and absolutely loved them. This book takes the cake. Our main girl is a tiny, fierce, sarcastic, hilarious woman. Her quips and remarks had me laughing the entire book.Our main man is a hot as hell, alpha male, but he has a dark past that lead him to where he is and the growth of his character is truly amazing. Malik is my favourite of all the men in these books so far.The storyline is incredible, it never drags. It’s constantly either action, sexy scenes, all the feels or just down right hilarious. The sex scenes are on fire, scorching hot and so well written.The epilogue gives us a peek at the next book and I’m a mix of sad that I have to wait until next year and a mix of ridiculously excited to read this story.It’s perfect. So freaking perfect 😍\n\n', '\n\n  This was a good continuation of JT Geissinger’s Queens and Monsters series.It fell with some of the story, but I did enjoy Mail’s stealthiness.  There was a lot of hype with the storyline regarding Sloane’s and Riley’s sister relationship and it fell short with how that played out.I had wished the spicy scenes were as good as the other books in the series, but this fell short too.\n\n']"

  Book Three of The Guardians Series“You scared her away!” Ellie accused, and Sean realized she was angry.“I nearly broke my bleedin’ neck,” he protested.“Couyon!” Her voice rose. “You’re being ridiculous.” “I barely caught myself,” he insisted. “That monster tree of yours almost took me out!”“This is my home—you need to leave.”“But I just got here.”“You weren’t invited!”“Which I won’t take personally, even though we’re partners and all.”“Partners?” The disbelief on her face was almost comical. “We are not partners!”“Sure we are. You heard Stuart. In tandem. You know what tandem means, don’t you, love?”She pointed at the door. “Go away, Irishman!”“McDougal,” he corrected. “But you can call me Sean.” “Que diriez-vous je vous appelle un idiot!” she snarled, only part of which he understood—idiot translated well enough—and then she closed her eyes and took a deep, ragged breath. Then another. Then she took a careful step back, as if she’d suddenly found herself standing at some dangerous, unknown precipice.Dousing the fire, he thought, oddly disappointed. “I’ve turned my ankle,” he continued, just to poke at her. He limped back a step. “I’ll need to ice it.”Her eyes opened. Fell to his booted foot.“Might be fractured,” he added.“You are a strange and frustrating man,” she said.“Aye,” he agreed somewhat apologetically and smiled at her.★★★     After Ellie Broussard saves Sean McDougal’s son from drowning, she walks away, unwilling to involve herself with the rakish Irishman and his charming boy.  Ellie has suffered a devastating loss, and her world is one of chosen isolation and calculated vengeance.  She has only one focus: to find the monster that stole her child and turn his world to ash.         Sean can relate to Ellie’s suffering.  Having lost his wife to cancer, his sole focus has become raising his boy, and love…well, love can take a long walk.  He’s in Louisiana to locate a cache of stolen art, and even if he’s taken aback—and reluctantly intrigued—by the mysterious and chilly Ellie Broussard, he knows better than to tumble down that rabbit hole.      But when they’re thrown together on assignment to recover the cache, Sean and Ellie have no choice but to put aside their mutual misgivings and work side by side.  To share; to trust; to discover they are not as separate as they appear. And as Ellie’s deadly hunt approaches its culmination, they must risk everything they hold dear to stop a murderer who is readying his next strike, and to save an orphaned girl whose only hope lies in their willingness to defy the darkness and step into the light.★★★★★""A brilliant book with lots of raw emotion, well written, packed with action and brutal honesty.

I really didn’t know much going in other than some video reviews I saw - some positive, some negative.This book is basically just sex, blood and gore. It’s reverse harem meaning one woman and multiple men (4 in this case). There’s really not much plot to the book other than a woman being sold by her father to pay a debt (not a spoiler, it’s in the book description).The book isn’t poorly written but it’s very repetitive and there doesn’t seem to be much substance. If you have a sensitive stomach or don’t handle violence/abuse/assault and very graphic sex scenes, then I would say this book isn’t for you.I just wish there was more to this book. It starts out promising with the female lead acting really tough but she seems to deflate very quickly. Yes, she’s strong and gets her own way but her personality and “quirks” become flat and she just seems to fade into the personality of the men.There’s no redemption, which is fine I like a grey book, but some of the aspects for the characters seem thrown in to make the characters more likeable? It doesn’t seem to jive with the rest of their personalities.Basically this book is just sex scenes, constantly. I don’t think it adds to the book.

 Switch: How to Change Things When Change Is Hard ,"['Chip Heath', 'Dan Heath']", CDN$ 16.99 ,0,"  Best Sellers Rank:  #1,212 in Kindle Store (See Top 100 in Kindle Store)   #2 in Decision-Making & Problem Solving  #2 in Business Decision-Making & Problem Solving (Kindle Store)  #6 in Business Development & Entrepreneurship eBooks  ",4.6 out of 5 stars,"1,464 ratings","
  Why is it so hard to make lasting changes in our companies, in our communities, and in our own lives?The primary obstacle is a conflict that's built into our brains, say Chip and Dan Heath, authors of the critically acclaimed bestseller Made to Stick. Psychologists have discovered that our minds are ruled by two different systems - the rational mind and the emotional mind - that compete for control. The rational mind wants a great beach body; the emotional mind wants that Oreo cookie. The rational mind wants to change something at work; the emotional mind loves the comfort of the existing routine. This tension can doom a change effort - but if it is overcome, change can come quickly.In Switch, the Heaths show how everyday people - employees and managers, parents and nurses - have united both minds and, as a result, achieved dramatic results:● The lowly medical interns who managed to defeat an entrenched, decades-old medical practice that was endangering patients● The home-organizing guru who developed a simple technique for overcoming the dread of housekeeping ● The manager who transformed a lackadaisical customer-support team into service zealots by removing a standard tool of customer service In a compelling, story-driven narrative, the Heaths bring together decades of counterintuitive research in psychology, sociology, and other fields to shed new light on how we can effect transformative change. Switch shows that successful changes follow a pattern, a pattern you can use to make the changes that matter to you, whether your interest is in changing the world or changing your waistline.

So many interesting examples.Longer Take:I just finished reading “Switch” by Chip and Dan Heath and thoroughly enjoyed it.Have you ever said, “I can’t change things, I’m not the boss.”? Or, “We can’t change that, we don’t have the money.”? I’ve certainly said both. If you have to, this book is for you.“Switch” teaches a specific process to implement change. It is predominantly targeted at change within an organization, but could just as easily be applied to life in general. The authors wrote this specifically for people with limited resources and little authority. No more excuses!I especially enjoyed the elephant and rider metaphor used throughout the book.Each one of us has an elephant and a rider in us. The rider is the rational part of our brain and the elephant is emotional. For real change to occur, you have to appeal to both. If you just appeal to the rider, you get a plan but no motivation. If you just appeal to the elephant, you have motivation but no direction. Real change requires convincing them both.This metaphor is then applied to each change principle throughout the book.My favourite part of any business book is the real-life examples. “Switch” does not disappoint in this area. Each chapter and concept includes several interesting examples. Most importantly, the examples made the change process seem achievable. If they can do it, so can I.Reading this as an entrepreneur, I guarantee you will find many useful strategies to help your business (e.g. Check out the “first 2 stamps free” example on page 126)Give this a read. Whether you're looking to implement change in your organization or not, you won’t regret it.Some of My Favourite Quotes:“Knowledge does not change behaviour.” “… ask the question ‘What’s working and how can we do more of it?’ Sounds simple, doesn’t it? Yet, in the real world, this obvious question is almost never asked.”“When you’re at the beginning, don’t obsess about the middle … Just look for a strong beginning and a strong ending and get moving.”“…behavior change happens in highly successful situations mostly by speaking to people’s feelings.”“Trying to fight inertia and indifference with analytical arguments is like tossing a fire extinguisher to someone who’s drowning. The solution doesn’t match the problem.”“…big changes come from a succession of small changes.”“Everything is hard before it is easy.”“We will struggle, we will fail, we will be knocked down – but throughout, we’ll get better, and we’ll succeed in the end. … people will persevere only if they perceive falling down as learning rather than failing.”Druid’s Top Entrepreneurship Lesson: Getting people to change (Employees = Change their behaviour / Customers = Buy a different product), is so much more than implementing the “carrot” or the “stick” (i.e. Reward or punishment). With a specific strategy, there are countless elements around the change that can be “massaged” to make change both palatable and easy (at least easier).\n\n"", ""\n\n  Fantastic, one of the best books I have read in ages. These brothers know what they are talking about if you manage or lead people, its a must. You just have to get past your own biases and mindset and stop and think and apply that they are saying.

We have every staff read it and we give it out as prizes at our events.\n\n"", '\n\n  I am currently working in a company  that is run by owners who plan to retire in the near future.

  The first in an exciting new historical mystery series set in the home of Agatha Christie!Colleen Cambridge's charming and inventive new historical series introduces an unforgettable heroine in Phyllida Bright, fictional housekeeper for none other than famed mystery novelist Agatha Christie. When a dead body is found during a house party at the home of Agatha Christie and her husband Max Mallowan, it's up to famous author's head of household, Phyllida Bright, to investigate...   Tucked away among Devon’s rolling green hills, Mallowan Hall combines the best of English tradition with the modern conveniences of 1930. Housekeeper Phyllida Bright, as efficient as she is personable, manages the large household with an iron fist in her very elegant glove. In one respect, however, Mallowan Hall stands far apart from other picturesque country houses . . .   The manor is home to archaeologist Max Mallowan and his famous wife, Agatha Christie. Phyllida is both loyal to and protective of the crime writer, who is as much friend as employer. An aficionado of detective fiction, Phyllida has yet to find a gentleman in real life half as fascinating as Mrs. Agatha’s Belgian hero, Hercule Poirot. But though accustomed to murder and its methods as frequent topics of conversation, Phyllida is unprepared for the sight of a very real, very dead body on the library floor . . .   A former Army nurse, Phyllida reacts with practical common sense—and a great deal of curiosity. It soon becomes clear that the victim arrived at Mallowan Hall under false pretenses during a weekend party. Now, Phyllida not only has a houseful of demanding guests on her hands—along with a distracted, anxious staff—but hordes of reporters camping outside. When another dead body is discovered—this time, one of her housemaids—Phyllida decides to follow in M. Poirot’s footsteps to determine which of the Mallowans’ guests is the killer. With help from the village’s handsome physician, Dr. Bhatt, Mr. Dobble, the butler, along with other household staff, Phyllida  assembles the clues. Yet, she is all too aware that the killer must still be close at hand and poised to strike again. And only Phyllida’s wits will prevent her own story from coming to an abrupt end . . .     Read more  ","['4.0 out of 5 stars', '5.0 out of 5 stars', '4.0 out of 5 stars', '5.0 out of 5 stars']","['\nMysterious, atmospheric, and delightfully entertaining!\n', '\nEnjoyable Historical Mystery\n', ""\nHistorical Cozy Mystery in Agatha Christie's House!\n"", '\nWorthy of Dame Agatha herself\n']","['\n\n  Murder at Mallowan Hall is a clue-like murder mystery set in England at the home of Max Mallowan and Agatha Christie during the 1930s that features Phyllida Bright, a housekeeper extraordinary who, after stumbling upon the body of a last-minute, previously uninvited guest to the manor, and with a lack of confidence in the local Constable and Scotland Yard inspector sent to investigate the case, endeavours to solve not just one, but ultimately two murders by using her knowledge and love of Hercule Poirot and a little extra help from some of the other members of staff.The prose is descriptive and light. The characters, including the intelligent, independent heroine, are multi-layered, intriguing, and well-developed.

Even with the presence of Scotland Yard Detective Cork, Phyllida decides to investigate.An entertaining and well-written historical mystery, with a cast of varied and mainly likeable characters.

Phyllida Bright not only discovers the bodies, she also unmasks the murderer. Curious but efficient, Phyllida is housekeeper and personal friend to Agatha Christie. She's not your typical housekeeper, however, and there's a hint of mystery in past too. (Guess we'll have to wait until the next book in the series to find out more!) While there are a few interactions with Agatha, the story does mostly focus on Phyllida's investigations.Due to the number of suspects, I did struggle to keep track of who everyone was. However, I loved the downstairs characters and I look forward to getting to know everyone at Mallowan Hall more in the coming books.I also felt that this cozy was very well researched. There was a lot of detail about how a house was run during this time period. This gave a lot of authenticity to the story. In addition, Cambridge weaved numerous facts and bits of trivia about Agatha Christie throughout the novel. As a long time fan of Agatha’s work, I had a lot of fun uncovering these “Easter eggs.”While there were some slower moments / a bit of repetition, this was a really fun premise and I thoroughly enjoyed this light and cozy historical mystery.\n\n"", '\n\n  What better than a cozy set in a fictional home owned by the real Mr. and Mrs. Mallowan, especially the lady herself? Well, a cozy that could have been written by Dame Agatha Christie herself!Such a praise is tough to get from me, lover of Agatha Christie’s books, but it is very deserved.Phyllida Bright is a mysterious woman, there is no doubt, but I am looking much forward to reading more about her investigations! And see if she will ever get fond of Myrtle.An absolute must read, and reread many times over. That’s how good it was!\n\n']"

Child abuse can happen to the kids that you wouldn’t suspect. Don’t take what the parent says at face value, if you have a gut feeling, go further. Don’t convince yourself that it is ok. For those that think they wouldn’t have done what the kids or adults did, be blessed that you have never been a victim of intense manipulation.

New to the work of Ross Greenwood, I was also interested to see if this might be a new author to add to my ever-growing list of authors to follow. Fifty years ago, a family is gunned down in an apparent form of retribution. Left for dead in the snow, the one survivor plots revenge in an attempt to ensure the family did not die in vain. At present, DI John Barton is working in Peterborough, happy that the crime rate is much lower than in cities like London. As he plans to reconnect with his wife during a needed few days off, he is called to the scene of a crime. A local drug user is found stabbed multiple times in the back, his neck slit. Barton is a little shocked, as this community rarely sees a homicide, but he rushes into action. With few leads, Barton works with his colleagues to determine what must be going on. Meanwhile, the Snow Killer emerges with their own narrative, having exacted revenge for the deaths five decades ago. It would seem that the snow is a form of homicidal aphrodisiac, forcing new and needed victims to meet their end. As the Snow Killer continues to strike, DI Barton tries to piece the murders together, receiving a lead from a long ago ‘cold’ case of a family murdered in the snow. When the pieces fall into place, Barton cannot believe his luck, though there are still a few on the killer’s list and snow is expected in the forecast. A decent police procedural that keeps the reader flipping pages until the climactic ending. Recommended to those who love quick reads that are full of detail, as well as the reader who loves a British crime thriller with a twist.Ross Greenwood does well with this series debut, pulling the reader into the middle of the story from the outset. The novel moves quickly and offers up a great deal of character development, hinting that the next few novels are in the works. DI John Barton proves to be a wonderful cop as well as a dedicated father. However, with these two jobs comes some needed sacrifices at times. With a wife he loves more than life itself, Barton has found a partner who is able to help him balance the rigours of work and three testy children. Barton reveals much in this debut, both personally and through his work, leaving his character development high and forcing the reader to pose many questions. Others within the book offer some slow development, hinting at the need to discover more in future books. Greenwood crafts his characters well and keeps the reader wanting more. The overall plot was well written and the theme proved useful as the narrative progressed. While it was not the most captivating or cliffhanging novel I have read this year, I found it highly entertaining. The mix of short and long chapters keep the reader pushing forward to learn just a little more before the final reveal and the race to the finish. I will return to follow the series, as I am eager to see what Ross Greenwood has in store for Barton and the rest of the Peterborough crew.Kudos, Mr. Greenwood, on this series debut. The premise worked well and I hope to see more exciting adventures in the near future.\n\n', '\n\n  THE SNOW KILLER is the first book in a British Crime Thriller Series by Ross Greenwood featuring Detective Inspector John Barton. This is the second novel I have read by this author, and I can see that it will be well received and appeal to a wide audience, as it combines many different genres.The novel is set in the United Kingdom and opens with a family being gunned down in the snow but one of the children survives. Three years on, that child takes revenge and the Snow Killer is born. But then no further crimes are committed, and the case goes cold.Fifty years later, with one murder after another, DI John Barton and his team are assigned with solving the crimes with lack of leads. His team scurry to put the pieces of the puzzle together, with the killer hiding in plain sight. Meanwhile, the murders continue…Has the Snow Killer resurfaced or is this a copycat Snow Killer?This is a race against time and the elements – each time it snows another person dies.The story is told from alternating POV’s, DI Barton and The Snow Killer.This series shows much promise with an intriguing crime story, believable well-developed characters with a final dramatic twist in its tale which will surprise most crime thriller readers. Looking forward to the next book in the series.Many thanks to the author and The Book Club Reviewer Request Group (FB) for my digital copy.\n\n', '\n\n  The Snow Killer is the debut novel for Ross Greenwood’s character DI John Barton. I always love reading the first in a series and watching the authors development with the characters. This author has definitely been added to my “must follow” series. To start we are taken back to 50 years ago and a family is murdered out in the snow, or so the killers think. There was a survivor and the story alternates back and forth between the “Snow Killers” point of view and DI Barton. It took me a bit to wrap my head around a geriatric serial killer but I did and I enjoyed the read.This is a great police procedural with a major helping of revenge to be topped off by some major twists! A quick, easy page turner!Thank you to the publisher and Netgalley for the ARC in exchange for an honest review.\n\n']"

  “Csikszentmihalyi arrives at an insight that many of us can intuitively grasp, despite our insistent (and culturally supported) denial of this truth. That is, it is not what happens to us that determines our happiness, but the manner in which we make sense of that reality. . . . The manner in which Csikszentmihalyi integrates research on consciousness, personal psychology and spirituality is illuminating.” —Los Angeles Times Book ReviewThe bestselling classic that holds the key to unlocking meaning, creativity, peak performance, and true happiness. Legendary psychologist Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi's famous investigations of ""optimal experience"" have revealed that what makes an experience genuinely satisfying is a state of consciousness called flow. During flow, people typically experience deep enjoyment, creativity, and a total involvement with life. In this new edition of his groundbreaking classic work, Csikszentmihalyi (""the leading researcher into ‘flow states’"" —Newsweek) demonstrates the ways this positive state can be controlled, not just left to chance. Flow: The Psychology of Optimal Experience teaches how, by ordering the information that enters our consciousness, we can discover true happiness, unlock our potential, and greatly improve the quality of our lives.

It is basically a state of mind where one is so involved in activity ""that nothing else matters.""I studies psychology in my undergrad, graduating with high Bs and As. So I was surprised that I had a hard time following this book. One much thinner than my textbooks.Why I did not like the book:- Have you hear about point-first writing style? It\'s basically a method to keep the reader engaged by revealing the point/conclusion of a written piece in the early sentences (of the chapter/paragraph) so that the reader would not have to go on a SCAVENGER HUNT for what the writer is trying to say! Seems like Mihaly is not very interested in this method... Why? Because every chapter is overfilled with examples, quotations, and scientific experiments. The over-explanation takes away what the author was trying to get to. There is just so much clutter that it it makes it hard for the reader to understand what the conclusion of the chapter or even the paragraph is!- Be aware that this book does not give a specific, step-by-step plan for achieving a state of flow- I don\'t agree that happiness = flow. There is more life to that to be honest. I don\'t mind being in ""flow"" when studying or working on tasks that I find boring, to have the time past faster per se. But the reality is, the concept does not work like that! So if you are purchasing the book to make your boring chores or student/work life easier, you may want to re-think your purchase.I hope this was helpful! ¯\\(ツ)/¯\n\n', '\n\n  As a flow chaser and experienced through endurance running I can relate with the stories and experiences here.  This is a great read which dives into the physiology, phsycology and neurology of flow.  Highlighting the benefits and chase\n\n', '\n\n  I first bought “Flow the Psychology of Optimal Experience” in the 1990s. I also bought the Kindle version several years ago. I opened my Kindle copy of “Flow” last week and was astonished to see how it synthesized my Zen, mindfulness, Greek and Roman Stoic philosophers, Viktor Frankl’s “Man’s Search for Meaning”, Psychology’s stimulus-response conditioning, learning skills like Tai Chi, and much more.The following is  a quote from Flow:“Contrary to what we usually believe, moments like these (Optimal Experience), the best moments in our lives, are not the passive, receptive, relaxing times—although such experiences can be enjoyable, if we have worked hard to attain them. The best moments usually occur when a person’s body or mind is stretched to its limits in a voluntary effort to accomplish something difficult and worthwhile. Optimal experience is thus something we make happen.” (flow, P.3)  For clarification, I inserted  (Optimal Experience).\n\n', '\n\n  A great read on the power of an awareness of consciousness and how we can otherwise become distracted. Very applicable to life and work. A recommended read for leaders and professionals as well as those wanting to better understand why they do the things they do, and how to get the most out of it! This is a book I will go back to again and again.\n\n', '\n\n  I\'ve found that there\'s no middle ground with this book. You either think it\'s a pretentious self-help book hidden under a mask of pseudo-intellectual research, or you become obsessed with achieving the ""Flow"" state. Fortunately, the chances are that you\'ve already experienced it or that you experience it daily. This book provides some context on what Flow state is and gives real-life examples of how people experience it in their way.It won\'t provide a magic recipe for being an ultra-productive, focused human being but it will open up your mind a bit, it won\'t force you to embrace it, it will merely provide some context.\n\n', ""\n\n  I can't recommend this book enough. This book helped me to improve myself and change things I couldn't change as I didn't have the tools before. I bought an electronic copy, then bought a physical copy for my GF and another physical copy for my close family, as I'm convinced they really should read it.\n\n"", '\n\n  Pros: Well researched, well-written book about performance psychology. I would highly recommend this book to those interested in the self-help topic and also to those who want to understand some of the research being done in this field. Cons: The book is getting a bit old and it could use some updates.\n\n', '\n\n  This text is a very insightful glimpse into humanity, purpose and direction.

Newly arrived to Birmingham, Alabama, Jane is a broke dog-walker in Thornfield Estates––a gated community full of McMansions, shiny SUVs, and bored housewives. The kind of place where no one will notice if Jane lifts the discarded tchotchkes and jewelry off the side tables of her well-heeled clients. Where no one will think to ask if Jane is her real name.But her luck changes when she meets Eddie Rochester. Recently widowed, Eddie is Thornfield Estates’ most mysterious resident. His wife, Bea, drowned in a boating accident with her best friend, their bodies lost to the deep. Jane can’t help but see an opportunity in Eddie––not only is he rich, brooding, and handsome, he could also offer her the kind of protection she’s always yearned for. Yet as Jane and Eddie fall for each other, Jane is increasingly haunted by the legend of Bea, an ambitious beauty with a rags-to-riches origin story, who launched a wildly successful southern lifestyle brand. How can she, plain Jane, ever measure up? And can she win Eddie’s heart before her past––or his––catches up to her?With delicious suspense, incisive wit, and a fresh, feminist sensibility, The Wife Upstairs flips the script on a timeless tale of forbidden romance, ill-advised attraction, and a wife who just won’t stay buried. In this vivid reimagining of one of literature’s most twisted love triangles, which Mrs. Rochester will get her happy ending?

I think I need to step away from domestic suspense novels. Reading Harlan Coben novels, I loved that idea of every day people getting caught up in scary and suspenseful things. It becomes very relatable as you could be the protagonist in the story. With the success of ""Gone Girl"", the trend of twist endings and shock value have saturated most suspense novels. It either becomes formulaic with it ending this way or that way...or an implausible ending just to make it different. I feel like for me, it\'s more about the plot and characters and not just the twist and turns. I am still enjoying historical mysteries, romantic suspense and police procedural so it\'s not the mystery genre I am growing tired with. Sorry for the ramble, but this is just the baggage that is coming with me as I read this one. In the 23% I read of this novel, I did not get invested at all, so I decided to stop reading. With the Jane Eyre story, you sort of know where it\'s going and I just wanted to forward to when it\'s all new.***I received a complimentary copy of this ebook/audiobook from the publisher through NetGalley. Opinions expressed in this review are entirely my own.*** (\n\n', ""\n\n  Hmmm....I thought the premise was good, having taking some inspiration from Jane Eyre. I was curious to see what Hawkins had come up with.I found each and every character to be unlikable. Jane isn't a lead that earned any empathy from me at all. She's a conniving user, a thief and a fake, matching much of what she despises about the wealthy residents of Thornfield Estates. I'm okay with having no clear 'good' or redeeming character in a novel, but found the character development missed the mark for me as well. I never bought into the 'romance' between Jane and Eddie at all.Most of the story is told from Jane's point of view. Chapters from Bea do pique the reader/listener's curiosity. I do applaud Hawkins' manipulation of the reader/listener as we hear more from Bea. But again, it was somewhat predictable. I just, well I just expected more I think. More of a fresh story perhaps. The Wife Upstairs ended up being just an okay book for me. Still, this was a good listen while doing some quilting. I'm definitely in the minority on this book.St. Martin's chose to use multiple readers for this book - Emily Shaffer, Kirby Heyborne, Lauren Fortgang. They're all readers I have enjoyed previously and they all did a good job with this novel.\n\n""]"

  From the USA Today bestselling author of The Untouchables and The Phoenix Club comes a Christmas Regency series!

Suddenly, Bianca sees a future she never imagined—with Ash. But when the bullies from his youth are up to their old tricks, everything they care about is threatened, and it will take a miracle—or a hero—to save the day.The Gift of the MarquessThe Marchioness of Darlington wants nothing more than a child, but after three years of marriage, Poppy has given up hope. After losing his mother and sister in childbirth, her husband Gabriel is secretly glad she hasn’t been able to conceive, for he can’t bear the thought of losing her. Desperate to prove his love, he hatches a heartfelt plan to hopefully give her what she wants most for Christmas.Joy to the DukeDenied the woman of his dreams ten years ago by his father’s meddling, Calder, Duke of Hartwell, has decided to abolish the holiday traditions his father loved so well.

I loved the unashamed sex and appreciation by the various men for their women. I liked the sensitivities of various situational complexities that added insight and meaning to their respective relationships. Darcy Burke’s books are engaging and easy to read. I’d be surprised if you didn’t enjoy them as much as I have.\n\n', '\n\n  The Red Hot EarlManaging heroines drive me mental, and yet, the way Bianca goes about it didn’t bother me at all. It’s the sense of manipulation that I don’t like. Bianca is simply forthright. Rather than steering other people to see her way in order to help her, she does it herself She’s such a force of nature that the people around her can’t help but bend to her will. Ash isn’t quite a full-on gothic hero, he’s just too sweet, but he does share many of their defining traits. He’s a bit of a loner with a tragic backstory and the love of the right woman makes him even greater than he already was. I enjoyed reading about this group of characters and I’m looking forward to learning more about them in the next book.The Gift of the MarquessWow. There’s quite a lot going on here. And for anyone who has struggled with fertility issues, this story could be considered slightly triggering. Poppy and Gabriel are fantastic characters. Having been married for several years now, they’ve already made it past most of the worst miscommunication problems that often plague the newly wedded. That doesn’t mean their journey is all smooth sailing though; they still have their moments of ‘humans behaving badly’ where they don’t talk the issues through. No matter what else is going on, it’s easy to feel the love these two have for one another. I thought their emotional vulnerability came across as very realistic and I loved that both characters had growth they needed to accomplish. I felt that their issues resolved a bit too easily, but I realize that it happens that way in real life on a fairly regular basis. I’m dying to see what happens in the next book now.Joy to the DukeWhat a fascinating twist on A Christmas Carol. Calder and Felicity had the last ten years of their happiness stolen from them when his father schemed to keep them apart. My heart broke for this pair over the grief and pain caused by the old duke, but I loved watching all the trouble Felicity went to in order to thaw Calder’s heart back out. And in a scene worthy of The Grinch, we even witness Chill’s heart grow three sizes by the end. Now I’m kind of sad to say “goodbye” to these siblings and their extended families.I received complimentary copies of the books in the set.\n\n']"

  “The reigning queen of historical fiction” --  Fiona Davis, New York Times bestselling author of The Lions of Fifth Avenue  The New York Times and USA  Today bestselling author of The Huntress and The Alice Network returns  with another heart-stopping World War II story of three female code breakers  at Bletchley Park and the spy they must root out after the war is over.1940. As England prepares to fight the Nazis, three very different women answer the call to mysterious country estate Bletchley Park, where the best minds in Britain train to break German military codes. Vivacious debutante Osla is the girl who has everything—beauty, wealth, and the dashing Prince Philip of Greece sending her roses—but she burns to prove herself as more than a society girl, and puts her fluent German to use as a translator of decoded enemy secrets. Imperious self-made Mab, product of east-end London poverty, works the legendary codebreaking machines as she conceals old wounds and looks for a socially advantageous husband. Both Osla and Mab are quick to see the potential in local village spinster Beth, whose shyness conceals a brilliant facility with puzzles, and soon Beth spreads her wings as one of the Park’s few female cryptanalysts. But war, loss, and the impossible pressure of secrecy will tear the three apart.  1947. As the royal wedding of Princess Elizabeth and Prince Philip whips post-war Britain into a fever, three friends-turned-enemies are reunited by a mysterious encrypted letter--the key to which lies buried in the long-ago betrayal that destroyed their friendship and left one of them confined to an asylum. A mysterious traitor has emerged from the shadows of their Bletchley Park past, and now Osla, Mab, and Beth must resurrect their old alliance and crack one last code together. But each petal they remove from the rose code brings danger--and their true enemy--closer...

It was by no means a quick read, but it was epic and heartfelt. It is a remarkable work of historical fiction and will be one of my top picks for 2021, if not of all time. I am traditionally a fan of heroic WWII sagas, but I enjoyed that this didn’t put us on the frontlines or in the shoes of those living through an invasion, but brought us behind the scenes, so to speak, and into the heart of valiant warriors in their own right. I found it to be an absolutely fascinating masterpiece that brought me to laughter, tears, and frustration. It will be worth a re-read one day, and in all honestly, I’m having a difficult time leaving Bletchley Park behind.For transparency, I started listening via a gifted audiobook from HarperAudio via NetGalley.  I decided that format wasn't for me and purchased a print version and digital copy.\n\n"", ""\n\n  5 star read.  I love Kate Quinn's books and this is one of my favourites so far.  Quinn takes us to England in 1940.  Three different women are selected to work at what they discover to be Bletchley Park as codebreakers.  Wealthy deb Osla (dating Prince Philip no less), Mab-a girl from the rough part of town, and Beth-a girl demeaned by her overbearing mother who believes she is stupid.  The girls all find their niche at Bletchley.  While they work on breaking the impossible Enigma machine codes, there is a spy in their midst.  This book was so well written, the characters so well developed and the storyline clipped along, I enjoyed the read so much.  I hated to see the end of the book as I felt like I was saying goodbye to friends I had enjoyed getting to know.  Quinn just keeps on getting better with every book.  A great read.\n\n"", ""\n\n  Yeah wow!  I expected this tale to be as genuine and gripping as Quinn's previous novels, but was disappointed. She developed her characters well (some patterned after real historic people) and captured life at Bletchley Park well (which is incredibly well documented from many sources). But the execution was lacking, the drive to excitement lacking, and most of all the conclusion was unlinked from the prior storyline; could all of those people have magically come together - evading local police, MI-5, sanitarium personnel, other folks who had sworn an oath of secrecy - to resolve the conflict which one main character found herself embroiled in???\n\n"", ""\n\n  Great book.  Second best for Kate after The Alice Network.  I loved it.  Listen to the Betchley Park podcasts (UK) if you want the actual history behind it.  This is such an exciting and important time in the history of women's contribution to WWII effort.  It is AMAZING what young women did during the war.  Feminism didn't start in the 1970s.  It started here.  Kate Quinn never fails to bring history to you.  It must have been such an incredible experience to have done what they did.  There are so many stories of women's contributions.  Quinn's books transport you and you become so engrossed in the story.  She is a very compelling writer.\n\n"", '\n\n  This is one of the best books I have read in years.  Utterly amazing.  The characters were well written - easy to ""see"" and ""hear.""  The story line is fascinating.  There were many times within the book that my heart was racing in anticipation as I tore through a particular section to see how it would turn out.\n\n', ""\n\n  The Rose Code is of the best books I've read in a long time. I've read The Alice Network and The Huntress, as well, and loved both, but I think this is my favourite Kate Quinn novel. Initially, I was slow to progress through the book because I spent a long time trying to understand code-breaking and how it worked. Once I put aside trying to fully comprehend the codebreaking process, I was able to better enjoy the book, its characters and the history. I really enjoyed how Kate Quinn weaved many real people into the novel with her fictional characters. I think this book will stick with me for a long time.\n\n""]"

There is some bullying and small town drama so there is that bit of exaggeration and having to use your imagination for some of the things that occur.Besides the exaggerated bullying, I like the characters and the few mysteries within the small town and with the characters. There’s the big mystery of why Lily was sent to an institution for years without remembering the event that caused her incarceration, who the big evil company is and what their motivations are, what happened to the guys and a few other mysteries I don’t want to give away. I’m sure they are all connected somehow but we don’t know quite yet. It was a good introduction to the mysteries and the series.I like that all of the men were distinguishable. It did get confusing at times going between the possessed bodies and the ghosts but once you caught on it was easy. They were a bit of your typical guys within these type of books but they were well written.This is a pretty slow burn romance. There is a bit of steam but the romance is more on the back burner in this book. I think it’s more about introductions, setting the scenes and atmosphere and focusing on the build up.The ending kind of came out of nowhere.

  The updated edition of the bestselling book that has changed millions of lives with its insights into the growth mindset“Through clever research studies and engaging writing, Dweck illuminates how our beliefs about our capabilities exert tremendous influence on how we learn and which paths we take in life.”—Bill Gates, GatesNotes After decades of research, world-renowned Stanford University psychologist Carol S. Dweck, Ph.D., discovered a simple but groundbreaking idea: the power of mindset. In this brilliant book, she shows how success in school, work, sports, the arts, and almost every area of human endeavor can be dramatically influenced by how we think about our talents and abilities. People with a fixed mindset—those who believe that abilities are fixed—are less likely to flourish than those with a growth mindset—those who believe that abilities can be developed. Mindset reveals how great parents, teachers, managers, and athletes can put this idea to use to foster outstanding accomplishment. In this edition, Dweck offers new insights into her now famous and broadly embraced concept. She introduces a phenomenon she calls false growth mindset and guides people toward adopting a deeper, truer growth mindset. She also expands the mindset concept beyond the individual, applying it to the cultures of groups and organizations. With the right mindset, you can motivate those you lead, teach, and love—to transform their lives and your own.

Does a wonderful job of explaining growth vs fixed mindsets as well as giving lots of practical examples.  Best strategy we have found is to have faculty read and come prepared to share around one chapter at our monthly faculty meeting.  This has worked really well in terms of people sharing and actually applying learning in their classrooms and in their lives.  Unforeseen byproduct is that it has also given teams a way to openly talk about, address, and gently challenge each other when fixed mindset thinking creeps in.  Very helpful if you have a team that sees constant improvement as a challenge or as a destination (instead of an ongoing journey).  Strongly recommend.\n\n']"

I have been following Brendon Burchard for a few years now, reading all of his books and taking many of his courses, including High Performance Academy.

It summarizes much of the material presented in his live seminars that draw 2,000+ people several times a year, and updates much of the research. What sets Brendon apart from other personal development gurus is the thoroughness of his research and the practicality of his action items. You aren\'t asked to speak to your inner child or manifest grace into your life; the items are as tactical as programming your phone or adding supplements to your wellness regime. But these tactics are all part of an overall strategy to help you achieve your goals in multiple arenas. But be forewarned - there is a LOT of useful information here. It\'s easy to get overloaded. My suggestion is to start with the tips that seem like ""quick wins,"" gain a little positive momentum, and then gradually add some of the bigger transformational actions.

  My new boss likes rules, but there's one nobody dares to break...No touching his banana. Seriously. The guy is like a potassium addict. Of course, I touched it. If you want to get technical, I actually put it in my mouth. I chewed it up, too... I even swallowed.I know. Bad, bad, girl.Then I saw him, and believe it or not, choking on a guy's banana does not make the best first impression. I should backtrack a little here. Before I ever touched a billionaire’s banana, I got my first real assignment as a business reporter. This wasn’t the same old bottom-of-the-barrel assignment I always got. I wasn’t going to interview a garbage man about his favorite routes or write a piece on how picking up dog poop from people’s yards is the next big thing. Nope. None of the above, thank you very much.This was my big break. My chance to prove I wasn’t a bumbling, clumsy, accident-prone walking disaster. I was infiltrating Galleon Enterprises to follow up on suspicions of corruption. Cue the James Bond music.I could do this. All I had to do was land the position as an intern and nail my interview with Bruce Chamberson.Forget the fact that he looked like somebody carved him out of liquid female desire, then sprinkled on some ""makes men question their sexuality"" for good measure. I needed to make this work. No accidents. No disasters. No clumsiness. All I needed to do was hold it together for less than an hour.Fast forward to the conference room before the interview, and that's where you would find me with a banana in my hand. A banana that literally had his name on it in big, black sharpie. It was a few seconds later when he walked in and caught me yellow-handed. A few seconds after that was when he hired me. Yeah.

I had the biggest book hangover from this, the cliff is SUPER high and the fall broke my heart. But the authors make it the wildest ride ever.

I'm about to do my second re-read in preparation for the 5th book of the series and I am not sure I'll be able to handle the cliff twice but it is SO worth it.

No one decides how bright you shine but you.» Remi's momWith The High Mountain Court, A.K. Mulford sets up a beautiful world in which a diverse cast will evolve. In this YA fantasy, she introduces us to Okrith and it’s five courts (High Mountain, Western, Southern, Northern and Eastern). Each court has their own witches (red, brown, blue, green and purple).I really like that the author uses the trip of Remi to explain to us the different culture and the different powers that each coven of witches has. There is a lot of world building and description but because it is separated between each place, it’s a little bit less overbuilding.I also like the fact that each court is really different. Nothing is left behind by A.K. Mulford, their skin color is different, their clothes and their ways of living also.I just think there was a little bit too much description in some parts of the story.The plot is well written and you discover the plot at the same time as Remi. There is just enough suspense to give you the feeling of wanting more. I figured out some parts of the plot before it happened, but I was still surprised by the end of it. For me, it’s always a good thing.Like in some of other fantasy, there were some obstacles that seemed unconquerable, but the characters got over them easily. For me, it’s always frustrating and seems rushed by the author.Finally, A.K. Mulford introduces us to such a good and diverse cast of characters. For me, it’s the best part of the book. Remi has just enough sass and she has a strong personality. When she sets her head around something, no one will be able to change her mind. She is relatable and believable.Hale is a strong fae warrior with a big heart and I like the fact that he doesn’t need to feel superior. He wants everyone to be equal.I think my favorites are «The eagles», two of the fae warriors under Hale commandement. They are full of dry humor.I like that we have different LGBTQ representants and no one is afraid of who they are and who they like. She choose to represent homosexuel and non-binary characters. It was refreshing and well explained. She also makes sure to use the right pronoun for everyone.The relationships are upfront and enjoyable. They are reliable through the ups and downs and you really feel the affection between them.I’m a sucker for chosen family or family by heart. A.K. Mulford prouves us that it’s ok to be broken and it’s ok to choose your family from your heart instead of your blood relatives.«Help lead this worl into a better future, Remi.

We have Fae, Witches, magic, adventure, an impossible mission, lovers fighting to overcome all odds, evil kings, and destiny.It was just the right amount of world building, enough for the story to make sense, and not overwhelming where you are skimming pages. It is such an asset for high fantasy because it keeps the plot moving and the pace up.The characters are well written, racially diverse, and there is great LBGTQIA+ representation.The love in this book hits on every side, Mulford shows family love, unrequited,  long lost, Fated... she hits it all.It was a bit of a slow start but still enjoyable.

I knew this finale would shatter my heart, I just didn't expect it to do so as throughly or as wickedly as this one did. This one is rough on the emotions for much of the book, so if you're looking for sunshine and happiness, this is the wrong series for you.That said, it's glorious. The book does not hold back in its heartbreaking ruthlessness, nor does it restrict on the action and majesty brought to its two main characters. Rielle in particular walks a truly dark path and I cringed at some of her actions. She is one of the most complex anti-heroes in the YA fantasy genre.As for Eliana, I adore her. Strong, powerful, determined, and inspiring, I rooted for her every chance I had. Even with all she'd been through, I could hardly believe at the power of her. Not just her magical abilities, but her character and drive.Of all the side characters, I felt Audric developed the most. He is just so good and sweet and brave and I ached for him every single time. Corien also became interesting and one of the most diabolical villains in the genre. I would have liked a lot more time with Simon since I have some serious questions for him and he left me quite conflicted!The action is top notch and ruthless. The story and arcs are amazing, though the first half of the book dragged out a bit for poor Eliana, who endured so much. I loved seeing more of the world and the creatures and the darkness that made it so compelling.This entire series is absolutely fantastic and I highly recommend one for anyone who wants a series packed with emotion, complex anti-heroes, and intense magic. It will leave you exhausted and fulfilled at the same time. I loved it!\n\n""]"
