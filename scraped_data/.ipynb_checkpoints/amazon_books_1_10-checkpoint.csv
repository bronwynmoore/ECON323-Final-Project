  ""Overachiever was hands down one of the best rom coms I have ever read. One word. Banter. It has that in spades and gets better as you read as if that's even possible!""  -- #1 New York Times Bestselling Author Rachel Van Dyken It started with a summer job and a ridiculous sex dream.   If you were to ask my friends to describe me, they’d tell you I’m an ambitious person. Responsible, driven, and focused on my goals. Words like stubborn and uptight would probably get thrown in there too. I’m not sure about that, but I know who I’m not.   I’m not the woman who lets a guy derail me from my plans. Watching others make that mistake has taught me well. No serious dating. No relationship until I’m successfully settled into my career. That’s the promise I made to myself and I’m determined to keep it.   Despite being an excellent student, there’s one lesson I fear I’ve learned too late. Funny men aren’t as harmless as they seem and should be avoided at all times. They sneak in under your radar and end up under your skirt. One second you’re laughing. The next you’re hunting for your underwear on a hotel room floor. Believe me, it’s not worth it.   If only my heart would stop screaming louder than my brain, I might be able to believe that Owen falls into that category. He’s my friend, but every day we spend together in this hotel, or working on our summer job building houses for charity, the harder it gets to convince myself we shouldn’t be more.    Years of diligence, and I’m being destroyed by a goofy smile.

  #1 on AMAZON, and a NEW YORK TIMES, WALL STREET JOURNAL, USA TODAY and PUBLISHERS WEEKLY NATIONAL BESTSELLERPharma-funded mainstream media has convinced millions of Americans that Dr. Anthony Fauci is a hero. He is anything but.   As director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), Dr. Anthony Fauci dispenses $6.1 billion in annual taxpayer-provided funding for scientific research, allowing him to dictate the subject, content, and outcome of scientific health research across the globe. Fauci uses the financial clout at his disposal to wield extraordinary influence over hospitals, universities, journals, and thousands of influential doctors and scientists—whose careers and institutions he has the power to ruin, advance, or reward.   During more than a year of painstaking and meticulous research, Robert F. Kennedy Jr. unearthed a shocking story that obliterates media spin on Dr. Fauci . . . and that will alarm every American—Democrat or Republican—who cares about democracy, our Constitution, and the future of our children’s health.  The Real Anthony Fauci reveals how “America’s Doctor” launched his career during the early AIDS crisis by partnering with pharmaceutical companies to sabotage safe and effective off-patent therapeutic treatments for AIDS. Fauci orchestrated fraudulent studies, and then pressured US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) regulators into approving a deadly chemotherapy treatment he had good reason to know was worthless against AIDS. Fauci repeatedly violated federal laws to allow his Pharma partners to use impoverished and dark-skinned children as lab rats in deadly experiments with toxic AIDS and cancer chemotherapies.   In early 2000, Fauci shook hands with Bill Gates in the library of Gates’ $147 million Seattle mansion, cementing a partnership that would aim to control an increasingly profitable $60 billion global vaccine enterprise with unlimited growth potential. Through funding leverage and carefully cultivated personal relationships with heads of state and leading media and social media institutions, the Pharma-Fauci-Gates alliance exercises dominion over global health policy.  The Real Anthony Fauci details how Fauci, Gates, and their cohorts use their control of media outlets, scientific journals, key government and quasi-governmental agencies, global intelligence agencies, and influential scientists and physicians to flood the public with fearful propaganda about COVID-19 virulence and pathogenesis, and to muzzle debate and ruthlessly censor dissent.     Read more  ","['5.0 out of 5 stars', '5.0 out of 5 stars', '5.0 out of 5 stars', '5.0 out of 5 stars', '5.0 out of 5 stars', '5.0 out of 5 stars', '5.0 out of 5 stars', '1.0 out of 5 stars']","['\nFauci Earthquake\n', '\nExcellent Book - everyone should read..\n', '\nTruth\n', '\nHonest and trustworthy journalism\n', '\nGet this book by any means necessary\n', '\nMeaning is found in context!\n', '\nNo matter your current covid opinions, read this book\n', '\nLies.

I love Melanie Harlow and I love every single person she writes!!Is it too cheesy to say this book is fiery? Steamy? Hot? I mean it all anyway!! Times a million! Call the fire department!If you like:- single dads- grumpy x sunshine- age gap romances- former military- next door neighboursThen this book is DEFINITELY for you because this has all of that and Melanie Harlow comes out SWINGING.Winnie is so sweet and perfect and I love that we get to see Winnie all grown up! If you loved the Cloverleigh Farms book, this is SO FUN because we get so so much Cloverleigh Farm content and we get so many updates on so many people, I loved it. We also get a nice little Bellamy Creek connections and let me tell you I SCREAMED when I read that. OUT LOUD. I try to take notes about books to remember my favourite part and ""Bellamy Creek"" is all I wrote down because I loved that part SO MUCH and I was just absolutely blasting through the rest of the book. BACK TO THE POINT, Winnie is amazing and I love how much we get to learn about Winnie and her goals and her dreams and her past and ugh, any man who ever treated Winnie wrong (I\'m looking at you Merrick!), if I catch you in the STREETS. BEWARE.Dex is, holy. I don\'t even know where to start with Dex. My obsession with Dex is almost so much that I can\'t even talk about it. I LOVE single dads and ex military and grumpy and first responders so he just scratched every itch that I\'ve ever had.The steam here is in FULL SWING. This is not a little spicy, this is ON FIRE. The smoke alarm is blaring. I can hear the sirens. Like WOW.The plot is also really sweet, we get to see a lot of character development from both Dex and Winnie. And in a true Melanie Harlow fashion, we get a lot of extra side characters and I was so excited at the end to read who the next book was going to be about.This is such an easy five stars for me, I will be re-reading this again tonight (and maybe every night for the rest of time????)""You ignited a fire in me I couldn\'t put out. I couldn\'t control my feelings for you, and I\'m sone who likes to be in control all the time.""\n\n', '\n\n  Amazing story! Winnie is 22 and believes in forever love. Dex is older, divorced and has two daughters. He tries not to notice his beautiful neighbour but fails every time. Dex is protecting his heart and tries to keep Winnie in the friend zone. As his love for her grows, he gets braver at trusting in love. Sweet, sexy and pulls your heartstrings.\n\n', '\n\n  Want an easy to read romance that makes you want to turn the page and love the ending?  Melanie Harlow is your girl!  I’ve read every book and enjoyed every one of them. This one is no exception.  Great story!  I even love the little girl’s story she wrote. I hope it’s made into a children’s book, I think it would sell! Can’t wait for the next book!\n\n']"

  A riveting new read that will thrill you from #1 New York Times bestselling author Fern Michaels, perfect for fans of Nora Roberts, Rachel Caine, and J.D. Robb.   Ellie Bowman barely remembers the incident that put her into a coma. When she awoke, filled with unease, all she knew for certain was that her boyfriend, Rick, was missing. She knew she needed to get away from her old life and recover in safety. With the proceeds of a video game she helped develop, Ellie starts over in rural Missouri, working from her cottage and trusting no one except her friend and business partner.   Yet even in this quiet small town, it’s impossible to completely isolate herself. Especially when a curious eight-year-old boy, smitten with Ellie’s pup, stops by every day to talk to him over the fence. Little by little, Ellie is being drawn back into the world through the neighbors and community around her, realizing that everyone has their own fears and obstacles to contend with.     But when Ellie hears that Rick has resurfaced, her nightmares return, and with them, small snippets of memory. No one has heard from Rick since before the incident, so why is he back now? Ellie wants to move forward with her life, but first she must find the courage to look into her past, no matter what she finds there . . .     Read more  ","['2.0 out of 5 stars', '5.0 out of 5 stars', '5.0 out of 5 stars', '5.0 out of 5 stars']","['\nI was looking forward to a “gripping novel of suspense”\n', '\nFantastic book.\n', '\nSuspense at its best!\n', '\nExcellent read!\n']","['\n\n  I was looking forward to a “gripping novel of suspense” but I soon found out that this book was more like a cozy mystery that I never really got into.

This kept me reading, in hopes of finding out soon. Then Colleen and Jackson were introduced to the story with Mitchel, the husband/father. This was a domestic abuse situation that escalated quickly in the chapter.As I was reading, waiting for some information to why Ellie was almost a recluse, it began to appear that the main character was really Colleen, not Ellie as the book\'s summary suggests. There wasn’t enough in the story about Ellie and her memory loss and what happened with her boyfriend.In addition, I found it hard to believe too many details about the characters and setting. The small town as described was just a bit too idyllic... it was too much like ""Mayberry."" Mitchel\'s reform happened too quick for it to be realistic. Colleen’s new romance was too fast. Hector, as a teenager, wouldn’t have time to do the amount of work that he is given credit for.The plot came to an end pretty quick and was anticlimactic with many situations working out for the positive so easily.

  ""Kick bad mental habits and toughen yourself up.""—Inc.Master your mental strength—revolutionary new strategies that work for everyone from homemakers to soldiers and teachers to CEOs.Everyone knows that regular exercise and weight training lead to physical strength. But how do we strengthen ourselves mentally for the truly tough times? And what should we do when we face these challenges? Or as psychotherapist Amy Morin asks, what should we avoid when we encounter adversity? Through her years counseling others and her own experiences navigating personal loss, Morin realized it is often the habits we cannot break that are holding us back from true success and happiness. Indulging in self-pity, agonizing over things beyond our control, obsessing over past events, resenting the achievements of others, or expecting immediate positive results holds us back. This list of things mentally strong people don't do resonated so much with readers that when it was picked up by Forbes.com it received ten million views.Now, for the first time, Morin expands upon the thirteen things from her viral post and shares her tried-and-true practices for increasing mental strength. Morin writes with searing honesty, incorporating anecdotes from her work as a college psychology instructor and psychotherapist as well as personal stories about how she bolstered her own mental strength when tragedy threatened to consume her.Increasing your mental strength can change your entire attitude. It takes practice and hard work, but with Morin's specific tips, exercises, and troubleshooting advice, it is possible to not only fortify your mental muscle but also drastically improve the quality of your life.

In my opinion, I'm so glad I got the book. For anyone who wants to do better, live better, grow emotionally/mentally, be happier, find peace...whatever...this book reminds us all about what we logically know but don't always feel. Even better is that she points out that life isn't about perfection, it's about progression. We're human. We're flawed. Sometimes even when we know better we don't, because that's life. Life is about trying and persevering rather than perfection and succeeding all the time.The book is great because she shows examples of how some of the undermining habits stem from some of the best of intentions, how subtle those habits can be and how insidious they are in affecting our lives. Then, she gives the light and the dark of each habit showing options to actively improve as well as gives examples of warning signs for thoughts/behaviour that can undermine the very goals we're striving towards.She's not trivializing suffering or even minimizing individual struggle. What she is doing is showing that the suffering and the struggle cannot be controlled or avoided. It is as much a part of life as the joy and the success, and it happens to everyone. However, there are tools / habits that allow the processing of the experience to be beneficial and even empowering despite the experience being a challenge, a setback, a loss, etc..This isn't a 'think positive' and it's all good kind of book. This is a book about actively assessing our thoughts and determining whether the thoughts empower or disempower/benefit or undermine. Using real life examples and personal experience the author allows the reader to relate and see that they're not alone. This is a book about working on improving by actively participating in life experiences while assessing how we view and think about the experience with an awareness of the thought processes that can enhance the experience for good or for bad.At the end of the day, life is a matter of perspective. How we view our reality determines how we feel and how we react. For some, tragedy is a gift while for others tragedy is the end of the game. Get this book to gain resilience and insight. I'm getting additional copies as gifts to help those I love gain additional tools and insight that will empower them.\n\n"", '\n\n  I will strongly recommend this book to anyone and everyone who wants to gain some insight in to mental health.

But when he finds that Persephone can offer a little slice of the revenge he's spent years craving, it's all the excuse he needs to help her—for a price.

It\'s got so many spicy scenes and they\'re so juicy hahaAs per the photos I posted with this review and the only complaint I have, is that the publishing company missed these typos. Im fairly certain there\'s a 3rd one that I forgot to take a pic of, I\'m considering using a pen to try and correct the first one lol but no other complaints!It\'s different to read a Greek God\'s related story that isn\'t set in Ancient Greece and that isn\'t about the original Greek God\'s themselves, in this story the original God\'s have long since died and the ""people"" of Olympus have since been voted into the roles of said dead God\'s for a few generations.There\'s no talk of mortals, demi God\'s or of these newly elected people having any relation to the original God\'s. (Zeus, Hades, Aphrodite and so on are now just titles and positions that people are elected into and they take on that name of the God or Goddess once elected.)lol but that\'s ok because the Author did amazing with the premise of the God\'s, because realistically the story doesn\'t need those kind of Ancient details as this is a modern vision of Olympus, designed as a city and is still away and a part from the mortal realm and it works great!\n\n', '\n\n  Whew!

And we get that here and it is oh so very delicious!With Neon Gods, we have a Hades & Persephone where the 13 gods & goddesses have been turned into the 13 leaders of the city of Olympus. And the rolls are filled by people seeking to seize power of their own. Persephone’s mother is the new Demeter and when Demeter gives her daughter to Zeus (a man notorious for his wives mysteriously coming up missing) in order to secure more power, Persephone runs to the one place she can’t be followed - across the river Styx. There she is taken in by Hades and the rest is a very smutty history.Sometimes stories don’t give Persephone agency in these retellings, but I had no concern of that when Robert is writing. Our Persephone is sassy, sharp, and she takes what she wants. We also have a brooding grump of a Hades who’s actually a big softy - so really this couple is perfection to me and I had a blast with every second of this book. I cannot wait for more of this series!*Thank you Sourcebooks Casablanca and NetGalley for the ARC*\n\n']"

  #1 NEW YORK TIMES BESTSELLER • Diana Gabaldon returns with the newest novel in the epic Outlander series. The past may seem the safest place to be . . . but it is the most dangerous time to be alive. . . . Jamie Fraser and Claire Randall were torn apart by the Jacobite Rising in 1746, and it took them twenty years to find each other again. Now the American Revolution threatens to do the same. It is 1779 and Claire and Jamie are at last reunited with their daughter, Brianna, her husband, Roger, and their children on Fraser’s Ridge. Having the family together is a dream the Frasers had thought impossible. Yet even in the North Carolina backcountry, the effects of war are being felt. Tensions in the Colonies are great and local feelings run hot enough to boil Hell’s teakettle. Jamie knows loyalties among his tenants are split and it won’t be long until the war is on his doorstep. Brianna and Roger have their own worry: that the dangers that provoked their escape from the twentieth century might catch up to them. Sometimes they question whether risking the perils of the 1700s—among them disease, starvation, and an impending war—was indeed the safer choice for their family. Not so far away, young William Ransom is still coming to terms with the discovery of his true father’s identity—and thus his own—and Lord John Grey has reconciliations to make, and dangers to meet . . . on his son’s behalf, and his own. Meanwhile, the Revolutionary War creeps ever closer to Fraser’s Ridge. And with the family finally together, Jamie and Claire have more at stake than ever before.

Gabaldon is a great storyteller and a very talented writer but it does seem (as other readers have also pointed out) that her writing is being edited less these days and it does now flow or engage in the same way that is does in older books. The use of certain phrases or thoughts too close together in a book really exhausts me and makes me think that the book was not edited properly. (Example, the use of *the character shivered and it had nothing to do with the temperature in the room* kind of thing drives me nuts when I see it more than once in a book, let alone in back to back chapters or scenarios. Maybe I am too particular, but I did not enjoy this book. After 900+ pages I was disappointed and exhausted that the plot did not advance for the characters that mattered, the same 'bluff' was used again as in past books, and the character development of tertiary or menial characters was frustrating. I would love to have the option to hear about these new characters, but in a different book perhaps when the focus isn't constantly being pulled from the characters and stories that I actually want to hear. If you are a fan of the books you will read it regardless  I am sure, but let me warn you that you will get most of the story from a synopsis and save yourself 35+ hours of reading.\n\n"", '\n\n  I am truly grateful that this book arrived here today. I am always excited to receive a new book in this series. Knowing what I do, I take a particular interest in this series.It did just arrive here, less than 30 minutes ago so I have not had time to read the whole thing, but I did read little portions here and there, as well I went to the beginning and read the first few pages. The book arrived in perfect condition and I am looking forward to reading every word within.\n\n', ""\n\n  I gotta say this was the only thing amazon let me down on out of everything I bought this year. I got this book for my mother's birthday and almost feel embarrassed to give it to her because it looks second hand..She is an AVID collector of Outlander and I wanted to surprise her with the latest mega novel..before she bought it herself. When it arrived today it looks like it had sticky fingerprints all over it and there are multiple rips on the sleeve of the book. :(The reason I even gave it 2 stars is because it WILL be coveted nonetheless, she's going to love it. I just think it should have been in better shape for being brand new.\n\n"", '\n\n  This book was such a gift.  I loved the Rachel and Ian storyline, I just wished there was more about them.  I am so glad Ian got another dog.  This was a big read, not complaining, but definitely not a quick one day book.  I liked all the day to day scenes, especially with Francis, she is such a great character.  I hope we find out more about her backstory eventually.  I also hope there is more of Denny and Dorothea in the next book.  I liked that this book was all in the same time/year, much easier to read than the last one.  This is probably one of the best books in the series.  Diana Gabaldon is really the best historical fiction author.  I love Sara Donati as well, they are in another league and I am always grateful when a new book is released!My only frustration is with William.  Why would he be interested in Amaranthus?  She was truly obnoxious, and impossible to like.\n\n', '\n\n  After 7 and a half years wait, I am very happy to be satisfied with the story of Book 9. Was it everything I could have wished for? No. It was also not 1500 pages long. There were parts of the story I would have liked to have more fleshed out. But as a whole, the story was full of action, there were lots of moments when we were brought up to date on minor characters, and parts of the story were resolved. It definitely had less of the political history of books earlier in the Revolution, such as Echo, but the facts of history are easily available to anyone looking. I would definitely add this book to my favorites pile.\n\n', ""\n\n  I'm in the middle of this 9th book in the series and savouring every word.  So far it is all prior to the War of Independence.  All of the usual characters I've come to love and the intertwining of relationships.  The rich tapestry of word the author uses to describe the life and times of the late 1700s and if you pay attention, even stuff that is important to this very day.  Although I'm sure the author uses poetic licence, I love the rich history that flows through the pages and chapters of this and all the previous books.  I just might have to go back and start from Book 1.....AGAIN.\n\n"", '\n\n  I felt like the story was very rushed. For example in other books a surgery would have been a whole chapter of Claire preparing, and then often another just for the procedure, but there were several moments when I was shocked how quickly something was finished or how many months we were jumping forward. I also missed the kind of heart-stopping adventures many of the other books were filled with. At times when a character was in battle or fighting for their life it was over so fast and we weren\'t left wondering their fate (which I suppose is nice of DB) or feeling like they were in trouble for more than a page or two. Compared to Jamie being pressed into the British Navy, or Ian being kidnapped by pirates, or witch trials, or stuffing baddies into the priest hole, this book was tame. And I wasn\'t looking for tame.Maybe part of my disappointment is that I have been waiting so long to read it, and DB had teased so many pieces in her ""daily lines"" on Facebook. If this had been earlier in the series I think I would have given up on finishing the series, and if the first book had been this uneventful then I definitely wouldn\'t have picked up books 2-9. Here\'s hoping number 10 delivers!\n\n', '\n\n  I enjoyed this latest instalment of the Outlander series. Entertaining informative and riveting. Now…. For book 10. Thank you Diana for letting us into your world.\n\n']"

I particularly enjoyed the suspense aspects but would have liked the romance and main characters personal growth to have been developed further.It was also a little difficult to read at times due to the sexual assault and violence and this may be a trigger for some people. Whilst things were resolved to a certain extent it looks like some will be carried over to future books in the series and this facet of the ending was rather improbable too.I received a free copy of this book via Booksprout and am voluntarily leaving a review.\n\n""]"

'Warm, funny, and almost unbearably moving' Daily Mail  'Rescued all those men who constantly mean to read novels but never get round to it' Spectator Books of the Year At first sight, Ove is almost certainly the grumpiest man you will ever meet. He thinks himself surrounded by idiots - neighbours who can't reverse a trailer properly, joggers, shop assistants who talk in code, and the perpetrators of the vicious coup d'etat that ousted him as Chairman of the Residents' Association. He will persist in making his daily inspection rounds of the local streets. But isn't it rare, these days, to find such old-fashioned clarity of belief and deed?

For that reason, I kept putting the book down, and only finished it out of my usual 'reader's obligation'.I won't give away the plot by explaining further, I just wish the 'elephant in the room' had been addressed very differently.

Audrey Coltrane has always wanted to fly. It’s why she implored her father to teach her at the little airfield back home in Texas. It’s why she signed up to train military pilots in Hawaii when the war in Europe began. And it’s why she insists she is not interested in any dream-derailing romantic involvements, even with the disarming Lieutenant James Hart, who fast becomes a friend as treasured as the women she flies with. Then one fateful day, she gets caught in the air over Pearl Harbor just as the bombs begin to fall, and suddenly, nowhere feels safe. To make everything she’s lost count for something, Audrey joins the Women Airforce Service Pilots program. The bonds she forms with her fellow pilots reignite a spark of hope in the face war, and—when James goes missing in action—give Audrey the strength to cross the front lines and fight not only for her country, but for the love she holds so dear. “Captivated me from the first page and never let go...a powerful tale of courage and sacrifice by the Women Airforce Service Pilots during WWII.

The writing was painfully bad and many of the plot twists were just silly and far-fetched. The characters weren’t developed and not believable. It was an interesting premise (and may in fact make for an interesting tv series with some tweaks) but, despite the intriguing concept, the book itself was almost unreadably bad. I forced myself to read it til the end, but regretted each minute spent on it. If you feel the same and are part way through it, just put it down. It doesn’t get better.\n\n', ""\n\n  Didn't know what to expect when I first started reading this book. From reviews I read I knew I was gonna like it, but it wasn't long until twists started to come up one after the other and got me completely hooked. And the twists got better and bigger as I was progressing in the story. The plot was original and cleverly developed. I liked the characters, mostly Christopher whose personality I thought was very well thought of. I highly recommend this book if you like a story with good plot twits. And you'll actually get five great stories for the price of one.\n\n"", '\n\n  I really enjoyed this and though mostly predictable, there were some pretty nice plot twists. I really enjoyed a particular storyline that started off being my least favourite and ended as the only one I was 100% emotionally invested.Characters were well drawn and distinct. I do feel that some of the description was stereotypical, but Marrs did a good job drawing us to their inner world. It was easy to see the characters motivations and understand their action. I don’t feel he played unfair at all, even within the curveballs.Although it felt very modern, so I could recognize the ambience as the present, place was not as rich or descriptive. If it wasn’t for the name of the cities mentioned, any given scene could have taken place anywhere.I do like this kind of book and the build up, as well as different perspective and most chapters ended in a great mini cliff hanger that just made me eager to keep reading to reach the storyline again! It was somewhat original, ma non troppo. It is a concept that has been done before, Marrs managed to leave his mark and make it his own, though. I wish he had taken it further and made another situation morally conflicting.\n\n', ""\n\n  I should have read further into this book. With the first couple of short paragraphs there's a young woman lying dead on the floor having been gruesomely murdered....how original. YAWN! isn't it time to move on from this?\n\n"", ""\n\n  The one thing that stands out in this book is that Marrs is a particularly gifted writer. Specifically, he's written a novel primarily about 5 people that were all at least moderately interesting but written in such a way that I was unable to put it down.The book revolves around a dating program that finds your genetic soulmate. From there Marrs tells us five very different stories that go in plenty of directions, some quite expected (but in a very welcome way) and some not so expected. It tells a story of people desperate for love in a world that says that it can find the person you're meant to be with. It carries with it all of the baggage and the relief of its characters all the time. It's quite lovely.I don't believe it's going to spark any ongoing conversations about the nature of love or dating any time soon, but it's a fun novel that you can't put down. I would recommend it to anyone who wants something heady enough that you have to pay attention but light enough that you don't need to seek out academic articles to explain the ideas.\n\n"", '\n\n  Would you take a DNA test to find your soul mate?  How far would you go to find true love?With a simple swab, you will soon be matched with your genetic soul mate.  That is a promise from Match Your DNA, a company which discovered the gene 10 years ago and has been matching millions of people ever since.When 5 different people are notified that they have been “matched”, they soon find out that nothing is guaranteed and finding true love may come with a price.My thoughts:  I’m quickly becoming a fan of John Marrs, although I’ve only read two books…..so far.  I find his stories different, engaging and well written.  This one was no exception.  It was an entertaining page turner told from multiple POV’s and was exactly what I needed to tune out from the world and just be absorbed in the story.\n\n', '\n\n  I never leave reviews for books as I think that they are completely subjective. However, this book is by far the BEST I have ever read. I have already forced my closest friends and family members to purchase a copy and read it, just so I could talk about it! I have attempted to pick up several books since finishing this one, and none have compared at all. I finished it in two days flat, it was so hard to put down; there truly is a twist on every second page.You would be out of your mind to pass this book over!\n\n', '\n\n  This was SOO good!  I’m so afraid of spoiling anything that I’m practically speechless!  It was certainly not what I was expecting, it was so much MORE.

Yet he is no ordinary killer.

I was hungry for more Witcher stories upon finishing it, so I decided to give the books a try. This first novel is nothing short of amazing. It's obvious why the games became so popular, because they do a great job of reflecting everything the books hold. I actually think that playing the game first helped me enjoy the book even more, because I already felt an attachment to the characters, and it was really cool to get context and backstory on the characters I had grown to love.I just love the way each story plays out, when you think you know who is right and who is wrong, who the real monster of the story is, it flips what you know on it's head and makes you take a completely different stance. I loved it, and I'm excited to continue reading.\n\n"", '\n\n  I was excited to read this after playing the video games of the same name and in anticipation of the upcoming T.V. show. It is very well-written, immersive, and thrilling. Any fantasy lover will be pleased, and for those who are fans of the games, this will offer a much-desired glance further into the Witcher universe.If you\'re new to the series, read this one in the order it was published i.e. after the main trilogy (you can find helpful lists online); this is because while Geralt is obviously prevalent in this story, if you have no prior knowledge of him or any other characters, you may find the descriptions somewhat lacking and have trouble imagining him. If you\'re a fan of the Witcher game, you can read this before starting the rest of the books (like I did), thus reading it in the chronological order of the world of the Witcher. As far as character development goes, I really found that this added to Yennifer, who I strongly disliked in the games (Team Triss!); I understood her motivations more than I did before, and I was able to even feel compassionately towards her, which surprised me.The books itself is made up of several short stories--interesting, not what I expected! The nods to age-old fairytales--and the twists on them--is a bonus; it plays on readers\' existing knowledge and lends to the nostalgia that arises from remembering the fairytales of our childhood. The episodes are generally ""stand-alone"" -- tidbits of Geralt\'s life as a Witcher and the people and beasts he encounters. There are nods to things going on in the world at large (politics, conflicts, etc.). However, there is one larger story that threads its way through the books, titled, ""The Voice of Reason."" This story appears episodically, interspersed with the other tales, which breaks up the ""quest-style"" narrative format by grounding the larger story in a chronological time.\n\n', ""\n\n  The Last Wish (the book that is) follows the story of Geralt of Rivia, a mutant monster slayer, as he recovers in a temple after he sustained a severe wound in a prior fight. This story is essentially interrupted at regular intervals by flash-backs and dreams which represent independent short-stories recounting previous adventures by the witcher. The stories told in this book are excellent, exciting and eventful. The writing however is somewhat tedious and laborious. I had to read many paragraphs many times before I could advance which sometimes kills the fun.I've played the games first then watched the Netflix show second. This book represents an excellent opportunity for the gamers to learn about the origin stories of the main protagonists (a subject the games don't broach and only reference very quickly). As for the show, this book is essentially season 1 minus the war and Yennefer's origin story. There are minor differences between the book and the show however.I ordered the hardcover version which doesn't feature a dust jacket like it's usually the case with hardcovers. All in all, the book feels nice but the cover warps in a weird way as the book is used.This is a good buy and I highly recommend it.\n\n"", '\n\n  I could say a great deal about the world-famous monster hunter. Geralt of Rivia is a truly exceptional individual. A brief encounter might tempt one to label him a mere swinger of swords, a simple monster-catcher, a rough-and-tumble practitioner of a dirty trade - but peer closer and you will soon discover he is a man of unplumbed depths, unique views and vast, world-spanning experience.\n\n']"

The lead female was desperate and she caved to the lead male way too easily and made excuses for him about his betrayal.Lead male is an unintelligent, weak, cheater with no morals. He is obsessed with his ex, and yes, he not only wanted her but holds and kisses her even when he is supposed to be in love with his wife. Took the idiot wife to ‘set things straight’ while he stood by like a simpleton watching. What a pathetic excuse for a man - I certainly would not have bothered to fight for him!\n\n', '\n\n  The blurb and title stood out, because I adore Eliza Jane Wilder from the Little House on the Prairie TV series, and always wished she’d get a happy ending of her own.The author did not disappoint.  Eliza, a wallflower, is on the marriage mart.  As for the duke, Dax, he needs an heir, but he won’t marry just anyone after being jilted by his ex-fiancée who ran off and married his best friend.The book gets down to business in the opening chapter by introducing Eliza and her sisters.  I must say the eldest sister, the bossy but vulnerable Viv, really stood out:  her marriage, her predicament, and if she’ll do something about it. It makes me wonder if there is a story for her, and for the other two sisters and the brother.  I really enjoyed this family and hope the series concentrates on them.Anyhoo, back to the review.  I really liked Dax and Eliza.  Both are quite different in looks and personality.  Eliza is given a wonderful character arc, growing from a shy, nervous wallflower to a strong woman who can stand on her own two feet, and even give the duke a much-needed push when he needs one.As for the duke, he’s a bit of a mess.  After being jilted by his two best friends, he’s at a loss of what to do, and the only one thing he can guarantee himself is to never fall in love if he marries a plain-looking woman.  But right from their first meeting, he’s hooked.  He senses something special about Eliza—special enough for him to ask her brother for Eliza’s hand in marriage.I enjoyed how they married quickly, and their marriage became one where they had to find their footing.  Would it be another marriage of convenience or could they make what they shared work?The writing is excellent.  The author somehow manages to keep a tired and true plot, with tired and true plot devices, fresh.  I mean, I did groan at one point when I saw what was coming for the couple, but there’s something about Ms. Clever’s writing that kept me reading.

His mother is worried that he’ll be eternally single. She has the brilliant idea for her and her husband to get dressed up in their Holiday best and escort their son into Seattle to bar crawl for women. Their goal is to be the ultimate wingmen for their son. Nora is stressed out and hating life at her family’s bakery. She’s gone to the Dirty Beaver to unwind and decompress. While at the bar, she runs into Coopers parents who are family friends. Turns out, Nora is best friends with Coopers ex-wife…the one he just finalized his divorce for. Cooper and Nora end up spending the ultimate night out together.This book was freaking hilarious. I couldn’t stop laughing during the first part of the book. Coopers parents were so funny. Down to their Holiday outfits and their banter back and forth. I can’t believe he took his parents to a place called the Dirty Beaver. I thought this book was so well written. I didn’t know going into it that it would lead to a longer novel that’s set to be released in 2022. I’m happy at least that Nora and Coopers story doesn’t end where it did. I’m excited to read more in the coming year.If you want to read something funny, sexy and heartwarming…check out this book.\n\n', '\n\n  There was no indication in the description that this wasn’t a novella or short story, but merely a tiny fragment. More of an extended situation set up, before the story begins. Personally, I didn’t feel the main characters had any sexual chemistry and clearly the man wasn’t even thinking about it through most of it. They never spoke about the issue at hand (the best friend ex-husband issue), she never texted her bff for “permission”, they just got drunk and went to it. Boring and then just abruptly cut off.\n\n', '\n\n  This is a short story, it is more like a synopsis.I would not recommend it for that reason alone.\n\n', '\n\n  This book had me laughing-out-loud! I just loved Cooper and Nora ... they are perfect for each other even though they don\'t know it. Cooper is sweet ... the way he takes care of his parents when all they want is for him to find someone and be happy. Nora works hard at the family bakery and with long hours she doesn\'t have time for a relationship, but one night ... yeah, she can handle that. Cooper\'s parents were a hoot ... ""being his wingmen"" ... still makes me laugh. I was glad to hear that their story continues in ""The Reunion"" because this book was way too short and I know there is so much more to their story. I can\'t wait!I received an early copy courtesy of Montlake through NetGalley in exchange for a honest review.\n\n', ""\n\n  I enjoyed this novella giving us insight in to Cooper and Nora's one night stand they had before meeting again a year later. It was a quick and an easy read! I enjoyed the humor in this novella having Cooper's parents being his wingmen was so hilarious. I definitely would recommend this novella to others.\n\n""]"

Her relationship with Sin is one that’s complex, full of steamy moments, and I honestly had to be almost at the end of the book before liking him.

A little smar alec girl puts him in his place. Great banter. Sexy. Loved it.\n\n', '\n\n  If weak women and arrogant billionaires are your thing you will get this series more than three stars I gave it. I read the whole series by the way. Most of the women were from poor/humble beginnings and in debt. Not a turn off because they were striving to make their own way. But no matter how sexy or rich these men were, it cheapens the women that A) they werent self-respecting enough to walk away when they were offered large amounts of money for favours, and B) they just ""melted"" and gave in after a kiss. C\'MON!!! Really?? That turn me off on the series. I did give it three stars because The Seven each had their own issues from THE INCIDENT and that was kind of interesting to ferret out and took creativity to come up with. Sadly though they claimed to be strong women to be able to get through to these men, IMHO they were really won over by the lifestyle more than anything. These women seemed to fall madly in love with these guys over the money and sexy looks rather than getting to the bottom of who they were and why first. Made them seem more like opportunists. Would rather they find out what great guys they really were before THEN fall for them. Also like to note these books could have been easily been written with a hundred pages less in each ... you have to get at least halfway through the book before the hero and heroine finally got together and it was really the same pattern just the names, and the INCIDENT changed. Not the worst books I\'ve ever read for sure but In fairness they deserve no more the three star rating.\n\n', '\n\n  Definite hate at first sight between Summer and Sinclair (Sin).  He\'s orchestrated it all for revenge that Summer has no idea about.  Definitely a dark and gritty book, and many, many ways this series can go with all the characters in the 7. ""We are opposite, and yet we fit.""  ""Your every response is my salvation.""  She challenges him at ever turn and I love all the names that she calls him, they are hilarious.  I really enjoyed this book and will definitely read more by this author.  ""Blah-bloody-blah""I voluntarily reviewed this book.\n\n']"

  AN INSTANT #1 NEW YORK TIMES BESTSELLER​ Named one of the most anticipated novels of the season by People, Associated Press, Time, Los Angeles Times, Parade, St. Louis Post-Dispatch, The Guardian, Publishers Weekly, and more. From the #1 bestselling authors Hillary Clinton and Louise Penny comes a novel of unsurpassed thrills and incomparable insider expertise—State of Terror.After a tumultuous period in American politics, a new administration has just been sworn in, and to everyone’s surprise the president chooses a political enemy for the vital position of secretary of state.  There is no love lost between the president of the United States and Ellen Adams, his new secretary of state. But it’s a canny move on the part of the president. With this appointment, he silences one of his harshest critics, since taking the job means Adams must step down as head of her multinational media conglomerate. As the new president addresses Congress for the first time, with Secretary Adams in attendance, Anahita Dahir, a young foreign service officer (FSO) on the Pakistan desk at the State Department, receives a baffling text from an anonymous source. Too late, she realizes the message was a hastily coded warning. What begins as a series of apparent terrorist attacks is revealed to be the beginning of an international chess game involving the volatile and Byzantine politics of Pakistan, Afghanistan, and Iran; the race to develop nuclear weapons in the region; the Russian mob; a burgeoning rogue terrorist organization; and an American government set back on its heels in the international arena. As the horrifying scale of the threat becomes clear, Secretary Adams and her team realize it has been carefully planned to take advantage of four years of an American government out of touch with international affairs, out of practice with diplomacy, and out of power in the places where it counts the most. To defeat such an intricate, carefully constructed conspiracy, it will take the skills of a unique team: a passionate young FSO; a dedicated journalist; and a smart, determined, but as yet untested new secretary of state. State of Terror is a unique and utterly compelling international thriller cowritten by Hillary Rodham Clinton, the 67th secretary of state, and Louise Penny, a multiple award-winning #1 New York Times bestselling novelist.

I was pleased to learn that Louise Penny and Hilary Clinton were collaborating on a political thriller. I preordered this book well in advance. I regret to say that although it contained much intrigue and action, it failed to captivate me. It should appeal more to those more interested in American politics, but definitely not to Trump fans. I have enjoyed Louise Penny's stories set in Three Pines with their kind and quirky villagers. Her part in writing the book was apparent in its style but did not fit the political thriller format well. Hilary brings her vast experience and knowledge gained during her time in the White House as First Lady and as Secretary of State to describe past and present world problems. Some have called this a work of revenge against Trump, depicting the former fictional president in the book under a different name, but it is clearly ex-President Trump referred to in the story. At his Palm Beach estate, the former President is described as incompetent, sleazy, narcissistic, a bully, and acting from his own delusions. He cozied up to the country's enemies and left former allies in a state of distrust causing a loss of prestige for America. In such an environment of division, the Taliban and El-Qaeda have thrived. There is a long, complex and convoluted plot. There were descriptions of thrills, danger, and intrigue in too many places, with characters widely scattered in various countries. I was not feeling the excitement and tension the way I was supposed to but kept plodding along. The book was strongly pro-female, usually brave, scheming, and intelligent women. They were able to outsmart heads of state, even blackmailing the Russian President to achieve their goals. The plot was constantly in motion, zipping back and forth to Pakistan, the Afghan border territories, Oman, Iran, Germany, Russia, Palm Springs, Washington, and even Three Pines, Quebec. The male characters played supporting roles to the women. With a few exceptions, they were duplicitous, treacherous, victims, secretive, or dull.  I thought references to literature and poetry were thrown in for us to admire the writing but didn't work for me except as a distraction.  The phone code between the Secretary of State and her trusted assistant was annoying, except for people wanting to catch up on grammatical terms, and seemed out of place in a thriller. There were repetitions about the newly appointed Secretary of State, Ellen Adams, being dishevelled, dirty, with messy hair and without makeup while rushing from one country and meeting to the next, and speculation why the incoming President had chosen her in an important role. She was head of a newspaper empire that was very critical of this new President, and he carries a hatred for her.  Her first assignment was to South Korea, one designed to fail. The first strike by terrorists was to blow up buses in London, Paris, and Frankfurt. Each bus was carrying a low-level nuclear scientist, and the explosions resulted in many innocent civilian causalities. There are hints and clues that three nuclear bombs have been planted in American locations. These were manufactured in an old warehouse in Pakistan. Ellen Adams has assembled a team, consisting of her good friend and assistant, Betsy, her son and daughter and various trusted colleagues to travel to various destinations to find out in what American cities the nuclear bombs are planted and try to discover people behind the terrorist conspiracy before the bombs detonate. They are prepared to use diplomacy and more underhanded means of coercion to save innumerable lives. There may be someone within the White House providing information to the terrorists.  I was sorry to feel so disconnected from the storyline. I have noticed that many enjoyed the book and found it thrilling. I have noticed that some people who dislike Hilary gave the book abysmal reviews without reading it to skew the ratings downward. This should not be permitted on any review site, and either read the book and judge it on its merits or not rate or comment on something they have not read.\n\n"", ""\n\n  I have read all of Louise Penny's books and eagerly looked forward to this new venture with Hilary Clinton.Sadly, it did not live up to my expectation and I would not recommend to family or friends.\n\n"", '\n\n  Fast paced, extremely well written- and extremely disturbing. Truly a novel of our times, touching not just on the terror of a nuclear bomb threat, but also on the growing chasms in our world. The rising sense of disenfranchisement between people in our society, the threat brought by social media to the perceptions of reality and the growing inability and worse, unwillingness of people to demand facts and truth. Louise Penny brings her exceptional insights into human behaviour and motivations while Hillary Clinton brought the insider knowledge of high level politics and diplomacy. This was an extremely synergistic collaboration between great writers, I hope they have future projects together planned!\n\n', '\n\n  When the CBC News anchor, Adrienne Arsenault, interviewed the co-authors of this political thriller it was abundantly clear that thriller writer Louise Penny and former Secretary of State Hilary Clinton had enjoyed their collaboration so much that the book was sure to be a winner. It is.The plot line is made all the more believable because so much of US politics over the past six years is woven into the experience of the fictional Secretary of State, Ellen Adams. Clinton and Penny base much of their captivating story on real world events and international relationships between both allies and enemies. The authors manage to describe both former and present world leaders when introducing fictional characters. As a perfect example, one leader is described as having dishevelled hair and being an upper class nit-wit. I wonder to whom that might refer? Another character living in Palm Beach spends a lot of time playing golf.The book tells a tale of intrigue culminating in an attempted coup resulting from right-wing activists upset by the result of a presidential election. It holds the reader’s attention from the first page to the last as the fictional Secretary of State hops around the world in her attempts to solve the political puzzles she faces.In their respective acknowledgements both authors express apprehension about stepping outside the boundaries of their normal genres, thrillers (Penny) and non-fiction (Clinton). With this book they have clearly demonstrated that such apprehension was ill-founded.\n\n', '\n\n  Too too too many acronyms for offices in the US administration.  Got bored very quickly. A tedious read. Hope it gets better.\n\n', ""\n\n  I had looked forward to reading this book, as it was written by two women I admire. Unfortunately, it had none of the charm or warmth of Penny's Three Pines series. Neither did it keep me on the edge of my seat, despite the title and subject matter. It seemed dull and lacking personality, and I eventually gave up reading before reaching the end.\n\n"", ""\n\n  I loved how it switched to Three Pines and the Gamache characters from Louise Penny's mystery series about Inspector Gamache. It softened the harshness of the previous parts about the Rangers all dying etc. It brought the story home to family and friends. Just as two friends wrote the book it kept the weaving of the politics with the humaneness we hope to find in our democracies. I hope there'll be more of these books.\n\n"", '\n\n  I’ve read all of Louise Penny’s books and thoroughly enjoyed them.  This one did not disappoint.  Great storyline, well developed characters and kept me enthralled to the very end.  A great  fictional story but makes one think about the things that could actually happen given the situation in our world right now.\n\n']"

  A guide to the surprising benefits of music on your mind, spirit, and body—complete with sound-based breathing and meditation exercises Since 1991, Dr. Mitchell Gaynor has been achieving remarkable results by integrating music, vocalization, breathing, and meditation techniques in his work with patients. In The Healing Power of Sound, he presents his sound-based techniques for self-healing—techniques that anyone can use, whether faced with a life-threatening disease or simply seeking relief from the stresses of daily life. Numerous studies have demonstrated the health benefits of music: it can lower blood pressure and heart and respiratory rates; reduce cardiac complications; increase the immune response; and boost our natural opiates. Gaynor shows how, when integrated as part of a mind-body-spirit approach to wellness, music can play a significant part in maintaining a healthy lifestyle or in healing serious disease. The Healing Power of Sound includes twelve exercises involving breathing, meditation, and “toning”—using pure vocal sound to resolve tension, release emotion, and spur the healing process—that can be used by anyone to improve health and quality of life.

The Huntress is an interesting story but didn't capture my heart the way that one did.\n\n"", '\n\n  The Huntress /  Die JagerinThis book captures your attention immediately at the beginning. The Huntress character Lorelei Vogt,  is based on two real people who embodied such evil. The set up of the book of the main characters is educational and interesting. It embodies women pilots in Russia during WW2 called the Night Witches. The stories of their lives, their flying expeditions over the German Lines is informative and interesting. The way the author connects a Russian female pilot to a British escaped Prisoner of war and their escape through Poland captures the reader to want to know the outcome. Fast forward to the Nuremberg trials and 2 men looking for a woman they call the Huntress. Their trips around Western Europe, then across to USA, the difficulties they had, the people they met who The Huntress had influenced and killed. The chase and the people she wouldn’t hesitate to kill was frightening. She went to great lengths to save herself.The team of four people whose lives had been affected by The Huntress wanted to obtain justice, and they did through a lot of hard work.

You can never read too many books about the Holocaust because we must never forget!!  This book is another great one!  It is simple in its structure and therefore accessible to every level of reader.  The character of Nina and the historical facts make this book amazing. Highly recommend!  It is also a good Holocaust literature book for a younger reader (teens 14-18) too because it is accurate but also not as gruesome in every detail as some others.  It would be good for a high school class actually. It has gay themes too, which is important for younger readers.  I loved this book. However, if you are a racist, sexist or homophobic, this is not the book for you....or is it? ;)\n\n', ""\n\n  I could hardly put this book down!  The characters were vibrant and so real.

The chapters alternate between the three chief characters.  The chapters are short which makes for easier reading.  The chapters on Nina and her flying excursions are so real that one thinks they're with her.  One learns early on who the huntress is which adds to thrill of the chase.  Highly recommend.\n\n"", '\n\n  This is a riveting story of the search to bring a diabolical female Nazi war criminal to justice.

This is a fun, down-to-Earth, clean rom-com and I look forward to reading the next book in the series. I recommend it.\n\n', '\n\n  I throughly enjoyed this novel. Read it in one day, just couldn’t put it down 😍 such a lovely read with great characters, some you love and some you love to hate. Well worth the purchase.\n\n', ""\n\n  -My first thought of the story was that it would be foolish of Emma. Foolish dressing up in sweats while everyone else is dressed up to the nines, including Mr. Darcy and his BFF and the hostess, Mrs. Watson. Not only you would bring everyone's eyes on you but you would be kicked out of the show ASAP, and not necessarily by the producers. None will remember you in a good way either (and they didn't), which is bad marketing for your business Timothy.-Editing: I'm not sure if I received an ARC or not but the editing needs another pass. Mostly apostrophes where they don't belong (historian's), special characters (wish I didn't \\), too many words (But I what none of us).-Any kind of competition, especially with a great prize, will get you these kind of people: mean, sweet, totally naïve, and the weird ones. Dating Mr. Darcy's competitors are completely in character with this. One by one, you see their real personality and that was fun.-Sebastian and Emma's romance is fast and hidden from everyone. I'm not too sure when Emma did fall but I can understand Sebastian's time when he did. Emma is a walking disaster.-It's delightful all through the book but the end is to die for. It made me cry so much I loved it. I was racking my brains, along with Emma, to try to understand what had gone wrong.\n\n"", '\n\n  What a delightful book! It was witty and funny and had me chuckling throughout. The author definitely has a way with words and her many characterizations were spot on.Both Emma and Sebastian had agreed to be on the Bachelor type reality TV show (with a Regency twist) for reasons other than finding true love. What they didn\'t expect was falling for each other! I liked that Emma wasn\'t pretentious and nor did she take herself too seriously. Being told solely from the heroine\'s point of view made Sebastian that much more elusive and I was eager to find out more about him as the story progressed.It was a clean rom-com that is sure to bring some humour and lightness to your day. I loved the modern references to Jane Austen\'s literary world that weren\'t over the top or too literal as is often the case. Now I can\'t wait for the sequel ""Marrying Mr. Darcy"" due out November 10, 2020.I received a free copy of this book and am voluntarily leaving a review. All opinions expressed are solely my own.\n\n', '\n\n  I tend to be disappointed with contemporary romances, but wow, I loved this charming story.I was with Emma for the entire story: there were moments when I was laughing, stubborn, or jealous, and there were moments when I was blindsided by the twists. However predictable the story may be, it was impossible not to be fully invested. This felt like re-reading your favourite story; deep down you know how it will end, but your heart is racing flipping pages just in case you\'re incorrect. There is drama and rivalry, the dating show is a competition and would be pretty boring without out, but there is also endearing depictions of female friendships that are not comprised throughout the story I was not expecting.This is NOT a Pride and Prejudice retelling in any way, if anything, this is much more of a Dating Show story. Emma signs up for a dating show that happens to have P&P theme, which if you think is a silly premise for a dating show, I will remind you there was an actual, real life, dating show called ""I Want to Marry Harry"" where the contests actually thought the bachelor was Price Harry of England. Go watch a trailer than tell me Dating Mr. Darcy isn\'t much more realistic than that mess. You do not need to be a fan of Jane Austen to read this book, but you will equally enjoy it if you are.\n\n', '\n\n  I laughed so hard my sides still hurt. In this adaptation of Pride and Prejudice with a reality-TV spin, we get humor, sweetness, angst, drama, and a dose of just plain crazy. Emma is just adorable. She’s the everywoman-kind of character that I can relate to easily. She’s occasionally clumsy, often snarky, and someone I just couldn’t help but cheer on to victory. Sebastian could be the poster child for the classic British reserve and stiff upper lip. But he’s hiding a world of secrets that could bring them closer or tear them all apart. I think this is the first book I’ve read from this author, but it certainly won’t be my last.I received a complimentary advanced copy of this book through Hidden Gems Books.\n\n', '\n\n  I shouldn’t have started this book so late in the day, because I stayed up until past 4:00 a.m. to finish it.  Once I started reading, I couldn’t put it down.  It is a fun, modern, P&P romp that had me laughing out loud.  The dialogue is thoroughly entertaining and funny.  I could see this done into a Bridget Jones-type screenplay.  It’s a bit cheesy in places, and I would have liked to see more time given to their budding romance, but otherwise, I thought it was well done.  Some proofreading misses.  I do recommend it for JAFF addicts like me who may enjoy a break from the typical P&P variations that take place during Regency.\n\n', '\n\n  A surprisingly wonderful book! Emma and her partner are looking for a way to promote their new clothing line. What better place to do that than on a reality dating show. Sebastian is the bachelor, a perfect Mr. Darcy with an English accent and a mansion in England. Emma is feisty and determined. I delighted in the interplay between these two, each with their own secrets. The other characters are varied and interesting, the relationships feel real and the humour made me laugh-out-loud. I recommend this book. I received a free copy of this book. The honest opinions in this review are my own.\n\n']"

Romeo and Vittoria’ s story is gripping and passionate. Captivating intense characters with a tantalizing and alluring storyline. Congratulations Jane! 👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻\n\n', '\n\n  I voluntarily reviewed a cooy of ""OATH OF SILENCE"".  This story hooks you right from the start full of suspense, intrigue, deception, secrets, lies, betrayal, humor, steamy scenes, mystery, family loyalty, danger, killing, twists you never saw coming addicting story for sure.Vittoria DeSanto was totally ripped off everything she had in her bank account her ex-boyfriend took her everything now living out of her car in Boston she was invited to Gustav Montavio\'s reading of his Will his lawyer Gerardo Rocco sent her the invite at his request she was summoned so didn\'t think she couldn\'t not go.Vittoria stops at a bar for a drink when a stranger sits at the bar with her buys her food & drink hes looking for a one might stand she sneaks out back he catchs her & almost rapes her when Romeo Rossi steps in she ends up seeing him kill the guy he tells her if I hear whisper of this on the wind what he was going to do to you is nothing compared to what I\'ll do now take off.Romeo Rossi & family all gather for his mother Tosca\'s father Gustav Montavio\'s Will reading only certain family members are allowed in the room to his shock when the lawyer asks where Vittoria DeSanto is everyone one but Marialena knows who that is Romeo when their eyes meet she sees the deathly stare he gives her she knows something about him that could cause problems.I definitely recommend to get this book such an interesting entertaining story the chemistry between Vittoria & Romeo heats up he needs a wife to take over the throne become Boss of Rosso family his father Narciso Rossi is crazy insane needs to be removed but thorough all this Vittoria doesn\'t who they all are what will happen when she finds out will try to run you have to get this very well written book to see what happens.I\'m so looking forward to the next hook in this series ""OATH OF OBEDIENCE""  which is Orlando\'s story, all the characters were well written hope they all get their own story especially Marialena I loved her character she a little spitfire.\n\n', '\n\n  Vittoria DeSantos, homeless and hungry, goes int a bar in Boston for a much needed food and a drink.  She is approached by a stranger who buys her dinner and expects a one night stand in exchange.  Running away, she is caught and assaulted by him.  She is rescued by Romeo Rossi, another stranger who kills her assailant.  Witnessing the murder, Romeo orders her to flee, keep silent, forget the “ unfortunate turn of events” and to never approach him again unless she wants to pay the ultimate price.  Although Vittoria is clueless as to who is Romeo, she takes the warning to heart. And thus, begins Vittoria’s daring and bizarre journey into what is known as the Rossi Family. The plot is engrossing as nothing is what it seems. The characters are genuine and entertaining. It is especially amusing that Romeo’s sisters do their best to teach him about romance in order to help him with seducing Vittoria.  Regrettably, the advise is not always helpful and provides another layer of enjoyment to the story.Definitely a ‘must read’ and am very much looking forward to reading about the other Rossi family members.\n\n', ""\n\n  Vittoria is way out of her league when she is sent to a reading of a will for someone she does not even know. She walks in to find the man that saved her the previous night.  Talk about throwing the lamb to slaughter. Nice intrigue in this story with people you love to hate and you hate to love.  Definitely a page turner.  I love this new series, there are so many possibilities to come and I can't wait to read what Ms. Henry is going to write in the future.  Loved it.I voluntarily reviewed this book.\n\n"", ""\n\n  Wow!!I absolutely loved the Irish Mafia series - Dangerous Doms, and this series is setting up to be as exciting!

  Clark Griswold was onto something, at least with his annual holiday meltdown. And since the last three weeks of my life have been riddled with humbug—another breakup, a broken toe, an office promotion I deserved and didn’t get—I’m not at all in the mood to celebrate nor have the happ, happ, happiest Christmas EVER.When Mom insisted that we all gather at my Grandparent’s ancient cabin for an old school family Christmas, I fully intended to get into the holiday spirit with the help of the three wise men, Johnnie Walker, Jack Daniels, and Jim Beam. But those boys did absolutely nothing to offset the shock or temper the sting of seeing my EX on our doorstep the first day of our holiday soiree.Apparently, Santa missed the memo, and this elf is pissed.Stuck for a week with the man who obliterated my heart nearly two decades ago, I did the only thing I could do and put on my game face, thankful for the home advantage.I knew better than to drink that last cup of eggnog.I knew better than to get tongue tangled beneath the mistletoe with the only man to ever break my heart.I knew better than to sleep with Satan’s wingman on the eve of the Lord’s birthday.I could blame the nog. I could blame the deceitful light blue eyes, thick, angelic hair, and panty evaporating smirk…but mostly, I blame Eli because he always knew exactly which of my buttons to push.I foolishly thought a family Christmas filled with nostalgia was going to turn my inner Scrooge around, but this year’s festivities went up in flames.

  From bestselling author Scarlett St. Clair comes a dark and enthralling reimagining of the Hades and Persephone Greek myth. ""Let me worship you,"" he said.She remembered the words she had whispered to him in the back of the limo after La Rose. ""You will worship me, and I won't even have to order you."" His request felt sinful and devious, and she reveled in it.She answered, ""Yes.""Persephone is the Goddess of Spring in title only. Since she was a little girl, flowers have only shriveled at her touch. After moving to New Athens, she hoped to lead an unassuming life disguised as a mortal journalist. All of that changes when she sits down in a forbidden nightclub to play a hand of cards with a hypnotic and mysterious stranger.Hades, God of the Dead, has built a gambling empire in the mortal world and his favorite bets are rumored to be impossible. But nothing has ever intrigued him as much as the goddess offering him a bargain he can't resist.After her encounter with Hades, Persephone finds herself in a contract with the God of the Dead, and his terms are impossible: Persephone must create life in the Underworld or lose her freedom forever. The bet does more than expose Persephone's failure as a goddess, however. As she struggles to sow the seeds of her freedom, love for the God of the Dead grows—a love that is both captivating and forbidden.

You would never hear me complain about sex scenes at all. I love them.\u2029Whenever I see a Hades and Persephone retelling, it’s a automatic buy for me. I love reading how everyone takes the story between them and made it their own and I will say this one is will entertaining. It did not take long for Hades and Persephone to meet in the book and I liked that, perfect amount of waiting. As soon as we meet Hades, he’s just so intriguing and delicious.\u2029Let’s talk about Persephone, I liked her very much but there’s something about her that I couldn’t pin down. I think it’s because she still trying to find herself since her mother had her locked away for her entire life that she still learning and we have to learn with her progress as well. But we can agree she’s not that good with journalism. Like she did nothing at that internship and she was barely there as well. I was surprised they did not let her go at all, that one little article must have been amazing or her boss has something up his sleeves..I liked her their relationship progress throughout the book and how Persephone was starting to feel Underworld as home to her. My favourite “side characters” were Hecate, Hermes and Lexa. I loved them all whenever they were on scene and I want them as my BFF please.I would definitely recommend if you like different takes on mythology retelling plus explicit sex scenes. I would also recommend listening to the audiobook because it captured the story so perfectly and the way the sex scenes were read was so good.\n\n', ""\n\n  This book was so hyped on book Tok and I was let down. I really liked the idea but the execution was poo. The smut wasn't badly written but the plot and some characters were lacking. Persephone for example I wanted to love but just found her so annoying and immature. Hades I feel was well done and was by far a more complex and developed character. It reads more like a contemporary novel than a fantasy so if you're into that go for it.\n\n"", ""\n\n  This book was an experience, let me tell you.I knew this novel was a modernized story of Hades and Persephone but I didn't expect that the main characters would actually BE Hades and Persephone. I know, if I read a synopsis I would have known this easily but I like to go into my novels with little to no information about the story.So with that being said, expect this novel to be somewhat of a fantastical/paranormal romance. I wouldn't say there is a lot of fantasy elements but it's combined into the story to make it more of an urban fantasy.As I made my way through the story, I warmed up to it more and more. I became fascinated with how the author modernized greek mythology and made this story her own. It was a uniquely different story, it was certainly entertaining, and the writing is done in a way where it captures the reader making it difficult to put the book down.I actually rounded up my rating after reading because I couldn't stop thinking about this story and started the next book in the series the very next day.\n\n"", '\n\n  I’m a huge fan of Greek lore, and the stories of Persephone and Hades is among my favourites. I’m always interested on new takes, and this one did so in unique way while still keeping close ties to different legends. It also has a ton of steam and great characters, which have made me eager for more.One of the highlights for me was Persephone. She is such a realistic character. I relate to her so much and cheered her on as she learned to stand up for herself and live the life she wanted. She was a great foil for Hades, who fills the role of kind, brooding protector. I liked seeing their bond blossom, but I also found it interesting just watching Persephone grapple with her own abilities and self.The romance is red hot and leads to some great intimate scenes. I also loved the scenes of Persephone speaking with various gods and legendary figures like Minthe and Adonis. This seemed to be a book more based on emotion and action, though there were some intense scenes near the end. Persephone’s power is not to be trifled with!I had so much fun reading this book. I genuinely looked forward to starting it every single day and am very interested to see what could happen next. The ending could make this seem like a standalone, but I’m attached enough to Hades, Persephone, Hecate, and Lexa that I want to experience more of their adventures. Highly recommended for anyone who loves Hades/Persephone lore, urban fantasy, steam romance, and new twists on old tales!\n\n', '\n\n  The book was really interesting. It’s a retell of Hades and Persephone’s love story. It challenges the reader on their view of Hades, to see him as more than what many have grown accustomed to. The Devil, Hercule’s evil uncle. It’s really interesting. It was also intriguing to learn about the Goddess of Spring and how she ends up becoming Queen of the Underworld.There were some parts where the writing was on the weaker side, but overall I enjoyed the contemporary feel of the book and the ideas and themes explored. Can’t wait to start the next book!\n\n', '\n\n  This book was recommended to me by someone with similar taste, and the premise of a modern Hades & Persephone story intrigued me. I am an avid fan of Rick Riordan, so I thought this would be similar, but more focused on the romance. I got a disappointing x-rated-focused novel, with no depth, and barely any character development. I liked the imagined world where greek gods live and mingle with mortals, but other than that the story is bland and the writing is not the best.\n\n', ""\n\n  So first of all, the book cover is beautiful and has a really nice texture.It's a light easy read and if you liked 50 shades of gray you'll like this book too.  It's a neat rendering of the Greek gods.  I did however find it fell a bit flat, from story line to character development.  The spicy scenes certainly delivered though! Considering it wasn't my most enjoyable read I think I'd still read the rest of the series\n\n""]"

Once I started reading, I couldn’t put it down. Secrets surround Jes and her family which also added mystery to the story. By the time I finished, I was an emotional wreck and needed a hug. Yes, I grew that attached to Jes.Note: This is book one of five so obviously there are loose ends and a semi cliffhanger but it doesn’t detract from the overall story.

  She fears the dark.He rules it.Her dresses are too tight, her heels too tall. She laughs too loudly, eats without decorum, and mixes up most sayings in the book. Little do most know it’s just a sparkly disguise, there to hide one panic attack at a time.Nobody can crack Gianna’s facade . . . no one anyway, until he comes along.Most see a paragon of morality; a special agent upholding the law. In the New York underworld, others know him as a hustler, a killer, his nature as cold as the heart of ice in his chest. Christian Allister has always followed the life plan he’d envisioned in his youth, beneath the harsh lights of a frigid, damp cell. With a proclivity for order and the number three, he’s never been tempted to veer off course. But perhaps one should never say never . . .One winter night and their lives intertwine. She hates him—his stone-cold demeanor, his arrogance and too-perceptive eye—but over the years, even as their games consist of insulting each other’s looks and intelligence, she begins to live to play with him.Nowhere in Christian’s plans had he ever prepared for Gianna. She’s chaos embodied, not his type, and married, but none of that can stop his eyes from following her wherever she goes.All along, she doesn’t even know that she’s his—his frustration, his fascination.His maddest obsession.*Can be read as a standalone, though it is recommended you read The Sweetest Oblivion first to avoid spoilers from Book #1   Read more  ","['4.0 out of 5 stars', '5.0 out of 5 stars', '5.0 out of 5 stars', '4.0 out of 5 stars', '5.0 out of 5 stars', '5.0 out of 5 stars', '5.0 out of 5 stars', '5.0 out of 5 stars']","['\nLoved these two!\n', '\nObsessed!\n', '\nAmazing !!!

  In Oceania, one of three totalitarian states that rule the world, Big Brother is watching. The Thought Police are listening. Reality is defined by the Party.

In defiance of the State, he falls into a criminal love affair with his coworker Julia. But it isn’t until he joins the Brotherhood, an underground network of revolutionaries, that Winston discovers how high the cost of freedom may be.

A false sense of security so to hide long-term goals ...Most of all we become more conscious of how the manipulation of information is a real and profound threat to the world and the environnement who sustains us.This book should be read by people who really care about their children.

They wrote exciting novels, adventures that made me dream.This book is difficult to read. The author occasionally describes action and romance, but spends much more time hammering totalitarian ideas and describing a dark future. George Orwell spent several pages detailing torture! Why?He wanted to scare us -- I\'m scared. He warned of a possible dystopia if we don\'t change, but did not offer a solution. Orwell repeated the core ideas several times without much purpose, which made reading boring.Every character in this story feels miserable. I reached the end and still found no relief or resolution of the protagonist\'s troubles. Winston Smith did not learn anything from his terrible life; he was not rewarded for suffering.""Nineteen eighty four"" is far from enjoyable to read. I am giving ** out of ***** for some world-building and fantastic crime scenes. Overall, though, this made me feel depressed, which is not the goal of a literary piece of entertainment.\n\n']"

  From USA Today bestselling author of The Highland Fling comes a brand new romantic comedy about a desperate billionaire seeking to find a fiancée. This modern day take on Pretty Woman is brilliantly clever and hilariously page-turning. How did you two meet? The quintessential question asked to every couple. And the answer is usually some bubbly, lovey dovey tale of being struck in the bum by Cupid’s arrow.  My meet cute (well not so meet cute) is slightly different. I was trolling a wealthy neighborhood in Beverly Hills, searching for someone to take me as their bride, you know, to make my arch nemesis jealous who consequently just fired me.  He was stomping around the block like some sort of gorgeous ogre, mumbling about a business deal gone wrong and attempting to finagle his way out of it.  And that's when we bumped into each other. There were no sparks. Not even a hint of blossoming love.  But next thing I knew, I was scarfing down free chips and guac, listening to this man lay out all of his problems which led to his big ask . . . he wanted me to be his Vivian Ward, you know, from Pretty Woman--minus the frisky behavior.  We're talking about living in a mansion, intimate double dates, and pretending we were head over heels in love . . . and engaged. Can you imagine? The absolute audacity. But people do crazy things when they’re desperate. And I reeked of desperation. So, I struck up a deal. My one big mistake, though . . . big . . . HUGE? I accidentally fell for the incomparable Huxley Cane.

I\'ve been reading romances for years but for some reason, had never read any of her books. The first book was ""The Strike Out"" and now this one, which in my opinion was marginally better than the first one. I am going to give her one more try to see if I\'ve just landed on some of her mediocre offerings because there is potential here. I\'m going to give the author the benefit of the doubt here because I\'m not sure if as a woman in her forties , I am her key demographic. I am finding a common theme with a lot of romance authors when writing their female characters. I get that their intention is to present a strong female with a kick ass attitude that doesn\'t take any guff from anyone. I like strong women being portrayed...but very few of them get the balance right between strong and vulnerable so a lot of these heroines end up coming across as immature, melodramatic harpies. In both of the books I read, her female characters tended more towards the latter. It is a fine line to walk and the authors that get it right, create strong beautiful heroines that you remember for a long time afterwards. The characters we\'ve met in Meghan\'s two books don\'t achieve the right mix and end up coming across as borderline unlikable, arrogant drama queens. I also found that both books were really hard to get into and the ""Meet-Cute"" moments weren\'t cute or believable. They got better as they went on and I was glad I hung on to the end of this one...to be honest though..if I had stopped where I first wanted to..I never would have tried another Meghan Quinn book. Short story long..there\'s potential but there are a lot of rough edges to work out when it comes to character development. I would love it if anyone here could recommend a MQ book that you loved because I would like to try one more...\n\n', '\n\n  I was hesitant to read this book after reading all the accolades on TikTok.  With most reviews, I hope I am hearing an honest perspective and not some false praise just for a social media post.“A Not So Meet Cute” did hit the nail on the head.  From the characters (main and secondary) to the storyline - it was a hit for me.I really enjoyed the banter of this book and the spice from “Chef’s Kiss”.I would recommend this book to read.  Not because thousands of others have read and remarked on it, but that it was a great story.\n\n', ""\n\n  4.5! Great read! First half was full of hilarious parts -especially the internal dialogue -  that made me laugh until my stomach hurt. I have to say that I think everyone was very unfair to Lottie though and not taking her feelings into consideration or her side in some instances that they should've which honestly irritated me a lot. It was an insane plot which was a fun spin on things but the moments they landed into made it worth the crazy. So funny and bonus for the Pretty Woman undertone!

  The most important fact about the coronavirus pandemic that turned the world upside down in 2020 is that our response to it has been an epic overreaction driven by a disastrous confluence of public and private interests—all of them purporting to “follow the science.”  Since the lockdowns began, millions of Americans have relied on the reporting of Alex Berenson. Exposing the hysteria and manipulation behind the worst failure of public policy since World War I, this clear-eyed journalist has been a critical source of reason and truth.  The product of relentless investigation and research, Pandemia explains how an illness that many people will never even know they had became the occasion for economically ruinous lockdowns and the suppression of personal freedom on a previously unimaginable scale. Dispassionate, factual, and untainted by any agenda other than telling the truth, this is the account that pandemic-weary Americans desperately need.

The book surpasses my expectations. I am familiar with the history of Covid 19 and the public response our political leaders and their medical advisors have forced on us. I am also an individual that has strongly disagreed with what has taken place in that, from the start the citizens  have never been treated as having the ability think objectively about their own well-being. Every thing that has been done has been mandated and human freedom discarded. This book recognizes what has happened and the author fully understands the dire consequences of relinquishing our freedom will have on a stable, prosperous society. A dictatorship, even one that professes to be benevolently concern with public health spells disaster.Can we re-establish a society that seeks informed consent, a society that strives to persuade rather than dictate public affairs? Can we recognize that our future does depend on our willingness to fight to reclaim a freedom lost because we panicked? Mr Berenson has laid out the case ...I urge everyone to take his words seriously.\n\n"", '\n\n  Well written and meticulously researched with 60 pages of references.

He’s been a trusted voice of reason in these trying times.Alex backs up his work with concrete data published from globally respected and publicly available sources of scientific evidence. There hasn’t been ONE source out there that has been able to discredit him, because he is relentlessly honest and meticulous in his work. Although they do try… When a reporter of this caliber gets booted off Twitter for speaking the truth, we should pay attention.I’m thankful for Alex and the very few other courageous truth tellers out there who truly follow the science, because they’ve kept me sane in these insane times.No matter which camp you’re on in terms of your medical decisions or whether you necessarily agree with all that is written in this book, it is brimming with the very best investigative journalism out there and is a MUST read. Or listen. I have both the hard copy and audio book!Congratulations Alex, on this great body of work!\n\n', '\n\n  Alex Berenson is truly dedicated to educating the world on the facts.  His opposition are enraged that he would dare to be honest and unbiased - something they have been unable to do.  I am only a few chapters into the book but, already at this point, things are falling into place.  I will have no trouble sharing this with those who have been entrenched in all the fear that our governments have shoved down our throats.  Not as an “I told you so” offer, but as “this is something very interesting most of us never knew”.  As a Canadian, I can see how influential US policies are on us eventually as we will follow suit sooner or later.  Thank you Mr. Berenson for your fortitude in pressing forward with this book!\n\n', '\n\n  Really simple. This book was written by an actual journalist. He 1) investigates, 2) uses his brain to make sense of what he finds out and 3) writes it down. Not many people using this method these days. Get your head out of the propaganda before it is too late.\n\n', '\n\n  Audio book was awesome. The written word will be just as good.\n\n', '\n\n  I loved the book, gave it a five star rating, and have repurchased it as a gift already. Since other reviews likely go into the pros to a great extent, I\'m going to list two cons I found a bit annoying. They don\'t detract from my recommendation of this important book, but just to let you know they are there.First, governments around the world continue to double down on invasive and rights-infringing strategies focused on scapegoating and discrimination (strategies which also clearly do not work), the subject of the vaccines is of great importance. I was a bit frustrated to learn that a bit of the content there was in the form of excerpts from Alex\'s previously released booklet on the subject. I suppose I would have liked to have seen those (short) booklet excerpts re-written at least to make me feel like I was buying something new. (Part of my frustration about the vaccines section, too, is inherent to the problem of releasing a book about current events: time marches on. By the time this book went to press, quite a bit of new information was already available and more continues to pop up every day. Hopefully Alex will follow up with a second book specifically on this topic.)Second, Alex has the endearing quality of wanting to be accepted and liked by as many soi-disant intelligent people as possible, despite the fact that many of such people are as far from reasonable as you can imagine, and will refuse to like him anyway. This desire to be accepted tends to crop up in passages about Alex\'s Twitter ban as well anything related to the most recent former US president if you know who I mean. In the former case, you can really tell how desperately he wants to get back on Twitter. (Let it go, Alex, that place is a desolate wasteland of everything that is wrong with humanity and the internet.) In the latter case, I personally find it grating that even reasonable people like Alex can\'t give that former president credit for anything whatsoever without first talking about what a terrible person he is. Maybe that\'s the world in which we live, but for me personally I find the constant stream of ""45 actually was right in this one instance but it\'s his fault nobody listened because of muh mean Tweets and so don\'t you get to thinking I like the guy"" a bit grating and off-putting.So those are my cons, and they don\'t outweigh the pros. Amazing book, buy it for yourself and your friends.\n\n', '\n\n  The first chapter sums up the government and civilian response to Covid: Extreme. Over. Reaction.A must read to understand how we got to this point.Team Reality needs to get a copy onto every desk in the CDC, FDA, NIAID, state and provincial health authorities.And then, into the hands of friends, family and neighbours.The spell of Covid must be broken and this will do it.\n\n']"

  I’m a Gemini. Impulsive. Curious. Headstrong. A twin. Heir to a throne I know nothing about. And it turns out, I’m Fae. But of course there’s a catch - all I have to do to claim my birth right is prove that I’m the most powerful supernatural in the whole of Solaria. And sure, technically that’s true as I’m the daughter of the Savage King. But the bit they didn’t put in the brochure was that every single Fae in this Kingdom would claim my throne if they could. The school they’ve sent me to is both dangerous as sh*t and one helluva party. Vampires bite weaker students in the corridors, the Werewolf pack has orgies in the Wailing Wood at every full moon and don’t even get me started on the dark and twisted ways the Sirens use their powers on people’s emotions, or how my sinfully tempting Cardinal Magic teacher hosts detentions that leave people needing therapy. Classes are totally interesting if you manage to live through them. And that Gemini star sign I mentioned? It now determines my elemental magic and affects my destiny, so learning astrology is essential if I’m going to beat down my classmates – which is actively encouraged by the way. My biggest problem is the drool worthy Dragon shifter who has his eyes on my throne. He and his three psycho friends are determined to make my time here hell. All I’ve got to do is survive. But fate might have other ideas. Dammit, why couldn’t I have gotten a letter to Hogwarts? ***This is a dark, bully romance – don’t go expecting a sweet school for magic with friends around every corner. Fae fight for everything they own and Zodiac Academy is a cutthroat school for students aged 18+ where only the strongest prevail. There’s no Dumbledore here to save anyone’s ass and Lionel Acrux will give Voldemort a run for his money in the evil dictator category.

  The national–bestselling biography on the country singer and songwriter known as “The Man in Black.”In this, the definitive biography of an American legend, Robert Hilburn conveys the unvarnished truth about a musical superstar. Johnny Cash’s extraordinary career stretched from his days at Sun Records with Elvis Presley and Jerry Lee Lewis to the remarkable creative last hurrah, at age 69, that resulted in the brave, moving “Hurt” video.As music critic for the Los Angeles Times, Hilburn knew Cash throughout his life: he was the only music journalist at the legendary Folsom Prison concert in 1968, and he interviewed both Cash and his wife June Carter just months before their deaths. Drawing upon a trove of never-before-seen material from the singer’s inner circle, Hilburn creates an utterly compelling, deeply human portrait of a towering figure in country music, a seminal influence in rock, and an icon of American popular culture. Hilburn's reporting shows the astonishing highs and deep lows that marked the journey of a man of great faith and humbling addiction who throughout his life strove to use his music to lift people's spirits.“Hilburn has written a brilliant story of an even more brilliant songwriter, warts and all.” —Keith Richards“The ultimate Johnny Cash biography . . . Rock writer great Robert Hilburn goes deep.” —Rolling Stone“Veteran music writer Hilburn . . . masterfully separates fiction from fact in an exhaustive, but never exhausting, biography of the legendary musician...The personal knowledge aided by extensive archival research and always compelling, accessible writing makes this an instant-classic music biography with something to offer all generations of listeners.” —Kirkus Reviews (starred review)  Read more  ","['5.0 out of 5 stars', '5.0 out of 5 stars', '5.0 out of 5 stars', '3.0 out of 5 stars', '5.0 out of 5 stars', '5.0 out of 5 stars', '3.0 out of 5 stars', '5.0 out of 5 stars']","['\nA great bio maybe the best on Cash\n', '\nThe book should be called, Living Death\n', '\nA Look in to the Life of a Legend\n', '\nMore Than I Wanted to Know\n', '\nA realistic portrayal of a famous life\n', '\nFive Stars\n', '\nwas okay\n', '\nFive Stars\n']","['\n\n  I read this book after hearing about it on a radio show about new releases.

He was a great songwriter and artist but he was also very human and had many faults though he was always trying to make amends. Much loved by his family and many children, he made mistakes, used drugs all his life and there was lots of booze and many, many women. In the end you cannot but feel closer to him and realize that all great artistic icons have their very human frailties. A beautiful book and I now understand why he is still selling records 11 years after his death.\n\n', '\n\n  From the start of the book, it was very up-beat. How J.R. grew up and broke through in to the music field.His early days with Sun and Sam Phillips are carefully detailed; almost like a ""You are There"" documentary. The start of the downfall , and the consequences are blamed on drugs; his marriage blamed on days on the road .Everytime the author builds us up, Johnny lets us down.Friends and producers, band members come and go like so many names. The marriage to June Carter is looked upon as a ""life preserver"", as is the birth of John Carter.Again our hopes are raised only to be dashed upon the rocks. The Man in Black was adeath image; always  bobbing to the top of a foaming storm, then sinking again.If the perils and troubles of Cash are not true, they would be hard to believe. His Christian outlook on life, and his constant hope for redemption was the fuel of this great entertainer, and great man.A must read for anyone interested in behind the scenes of the record industry, and how one man coped, or didn\'t cope, with his life.\n\n', ""\n\n  An entertaining and insightful look into the life of one the world's most legendary songwriters and performers. As always, Robert Hilburn doesn't disappoint. His well-researched material and ability to easily narrate a story make him one of North America's most respected music writers.  He knows his subject well, and was the only member of the press allowed to accompany Cash to Folsom, site of one of the most legendary of Cash's performances\n\n"", '\n\n  A very well written and well researched biography. Brutally honest. Sometimes difficult to read. I have always been a Cash fan, saw him probably 15 times in concert. I would just as soon not know all of his story, for his actions and lifestyle very much lowers him in my estimation. He was a religious hypocrite, claiming to be a godly man, while being a raging drug addict virtually his whole life. He had the nerve to preach to other people, while his addiction brought misery to almost everyone he came In contact with.\n\n', '\n\n  For those who recognize that Johnny Cash was a complicated multidimensional man and are not afraid to see the seedier side with the good, it is a well-written portrayal. It does not sensationalize\n\n', '\n\n  Great Stuff !!\n\n', '\n\n  Was a good read. Was a little long  in some  about other people and could have used more photos.

That’s like if I ever wrote a book about a murder mystery or something and had a character wearing a red crop top with their belly hanging out and I started marketing it as a retelling of Winnie the Pooh.

  NEW YORK TIMES BESTSELLER “If you’re looking for a book to take on holiday this summer, The Seven Husbands of Evelyn Hugo has got all the glitz and glamour to make it a perfect beach read.” —Bustle From the New York Times bestselling author of Daisy Jones & the Six—an entrancing and “wildly addictive journey of a reclusive Hollywood starlet” (PopSugar) as she reflects on her relentless rise to the top and the risks she took, the loves she lost, and the long-held secrets the public could never imagine.Aging and reclusive Hollywood movie icon Evelyn Hugo is finally ready to tell the truth about her glamorous and scandalous life. But when she chooses unknown magazine reporter Monique Grant for the job, no one is more astounded than Monique herself. Why her? Why now? Monique is not exactly on top of the world. Her husband has left her, and her professional life is going nowhere. Regardless of why Evelyn has selected her to write her biography, Monique is determined to use this opportunity to jumpstart her career. Summoned to Evelyn’s luxurious apartment, Monique listens in fascination as the actress tells her story. From making her way to Los Angeles in the 1950s to her decision to leave show business in the ‘80s, and, of course, the seven husbands along the way, Evelyn unspools a tale of ruthless ambition, unexpected friendship, and a great forbidden love. Monique begins to feel a very real connection to the legendary star, but as Evelyn’s story near its conclusion, it becomes clear that her life intersects with Monique’s own in tragic and irreversible ways. “Heartbreaking, yet beautiful” (Jamie Blynn, Us Weekly), The Seven Husbands of Evelyn Hugo is “Tinseltown drama at its finest” (Redbook): a mesmerizing journey through the splendor of old Hollywood into the harsh realities of the present day as two women struggle with what it means—and what it costs—to face the truth.

It isn\'t as ""fluffy"" as you think of when you think of a great beach read, but I would have loved to read this book while laying out on a beach somewhere.

Does anyone need to be essentially lectured to about this while they are reading a fluffy book at the beach?\n\n', '\n\n  This book is very popular for a reason.

I started reading it in the middle of finals week and it was a terrible mistake because suddenly I could not focus on anything until I finished it. I even read it during my breaks at work. It is marvelous, a beautiful love story that I needed, but mostly a character so flawed that she became perfect for me. Evelyn is by far the most interesting, well-crafted character I have had the pleasure of reading. I loved every single page, cried and laughed and cried a lot more. I cannot wait to re-read it over and over, for I simply missed her the moment I turned the last page.Please, please indulge into this purchase. You won't regret it\n\n"", '\n\n  I really enjoyed reading this book. There is a suspense hanging in the air throughout the read, but the ending was still a surprise. This is a perfect beach read.

Actually asking because I think that I’ve gone from like “likes her books” to absolutely obsessed and I’m in awe.Now to start on Window Shopping itself instead of fan-girling over Tessa Bailey for another 500 words. Conceptually, this book had me hooked. If you love grumpy/sunshine, this reverse grumpy/sunshine is like the crème de la crème, Aiden is pure bow-tie wearing sunshine, Aiden is the spirit of Christmas itself, Aiden is the present I want under my Christmas tree this year. In contrast, Stella is brooding and dark and she has a deep, tragic backstory and it just all works together to make them the perfect grumpy/sunshine pair!!Now if you don’t want any spoilers, quit here, turn back! Last warning!Watching Aiden transform from this bow-tie wearing, wholesome, rule-following dork to an absolute dirty-talking, possessive, protective HUNK without giving up any of the innate goodness of himself was honestly my favourite part of this book. I also loved that Stella didn’t just become this ray of sunshine, she still had her difficulties, she still had her background, she still had to work through her own issues and a man didn’t just up and solve that for her! However, their relationship is so meaningful and passionate and perfect. You know when you’re working on a puzzle and you look at a piece that doesn’t seem like its going to fit and then lo and behold that’s the piece! And then it’s so obvious, of course that was the piece, how did I not see that?? That’s Aiden and Stella.PLUS, in between being absolutely HOT and also so wholesome (because Aiden is Aiden of COURSE), this book was so funny. When Stella catches Aiden getting drunk in the store after hours??? Their banter is incredible and so funny.

This story was so unique and fun! I was honestly hooked from the opening chapter. It's definitely an insta-love romance, but it worked for me.Set within an upscale department store, Stella has dreamed of becoming a window dresser ... and she now has her chance. Despite her prison record and the giant gap in her employment, general manager Aiden hires her to style the window for the upcoming Christmas season at Vivant.Not wanting to jeopardize her opportunity with a relationship, I loved the tension created in this workplace romance. Prepare yourself for some intense heat. Wowza!Stella was a true grump with a tender heart, simply trying to find her footing after a four-year sentence. And Aiden was so selfless. I loved his nonjudgmental personality, immediately welcoming Stella into his life. Perfectly festive—I simply adored these two together!\n\n"", ""\n\n  Tessa Bailey has yet to disappoint. This beautifully written novel is absolutely perfect for a cold winter Sunday, accompanied by hot chocolate, of course.Stella and Aiden are a wonderful pair.

I thought it was a bit ridiculous how the two main characters immediately fell for each other in such a love struck way, the boss/employee dynamic made my stomach turn… not a fan. Lots of awesome reviews so maybe it’s just me being a pessimist!\n\n', ""\n\n  This was my first book from Tessa Bailey and boy did she not disappoint! The intricate writing, the romance that holds you by the guts, and the humor that is just perfectly dosed not to be cheesy and for you to connect even more with the characters. This grumpy sushine romance with the man being the sunshine was everything I didn't know I needed. Tessa Bailey is now a trusted author from whom I will not hesitate to buy more books. I loved the male main character's humor, and the duality in his personnality where he has a sunshine personnality and also a very intense side. He can be very intense, in a calm and sweet way, and other times in a very hot and sexy way. Seriously, don't be fooled by the cartoony cover, this is hot hot hot and steamy. But there is more to the smutt, because it is written with so much feelings and depth that it makes the tension and angst even better. I also adore how the male character is turned on by romance and intimacy. If you were hesitating, stop right now and go buy this. It's worth it for every reasons you're thinking, and more.\n\n"", '\n\n  What a treat this book was!

  The Instant New York Times Bestseller!As seen on THE VIEW!A BuzzFeed Best Summer Read of 2021 When a fake relationship between scientists meets the irresistible force of attraction, it throws one woman's carefully calculated theories on love into chaos.As a third-year Ph.D. candidate, Olive Smith doesn't believe in lasting romantic relationships--but her best friend does, and that's what got her into this situation. Convincing Anh that Olive is dating and well on her way to a happily ever after was always going to take more than hand-wavy Jedi mind tricks: Scientists require proof. So, like any self-respecting biologist, Olive panics and kisses the first man she sees.That man is none other than Adam Carlsen, a young hotshot professor--and well-known ass. Which is why Olive is positively floored when Stanford's reigning lab tyrant agrees to keep her charade a secret and be her fake boyfriend. But when a big science conference goes haywire, putting Olive's career on the Bunsen burner, Adam surprises her again with his unyielding support and even more unyielding...six-pack abs.Suddenly their little experiment feels dangerously close to combustion. And Olive discovers that the only thing more complicated than a hypothesis on love is putting her own heart under the microscope.

It was well written, though after a while, tbh, I did find the heroine's lying and lying for the sake of others tiresome.  Ok, at one point I wanted to take a hammer to my reader.  Same with the sex scene, it was lovely, nice that consent was made obvious, but the stop, start, stop, oh wait, stop, but...Adam? was laid on a bit thick and I was tempted to throw said reader.  But aside from that, I still found it very enjoyable and fun to read, and it kept my interest, so that was the main thing.  Thanks for a good read.  Five stars. :)\n\n"", ""\n\n  This book was heavily recommended in my reader group. I'm always nervous about books with cartoon covers.I absolutely loved this book! Ali managed to top all other fake dating trope romance novels out there. This book was hilarious. The writing was entertaining while informative. The dialogue was really fast and smart. The back and forth banter reminds me of Gilmore Girls.Nothing bad to say what so ever about this book. Amazing. Definitely lives up to all the hype.\n\n"", ""\n\n  This novel deserves every bit of the praise that it’s been receiving. As soon as I began reading The Love Hypothesis, I knew that I had found a gem. This is a fabulous debut that, after finishing it, had me wanting to go back to page one and read it all over again.I adored Olive right from the very beginning. She’s intelligent, sweet, loyal, and quirky. I wanted to be her friend! When she needed to convince her friend that she was dating someone new (which she wasn’t), she grabbed the first guy that she came across in the hallway of her department. Lo and behold, she ended up kissing a highly revered, unapproachable, and feared professor. Yes!Dr. Carlsen was everything that I wanted in a grumpy, scholarly, unfriendly character. With his uptight, rigid personality and Olive’s awkward, witty charm, these two were pure gold.As a fan of slow-burning romances, this one was perfection. I felt Olive and Adam’s attraction from the get-go, but the author took her time to build their connection and, in turn, built up my anticipation. There’s nothing better than falling in love right alongside the characters, and that’s just what I did. From the butterflies in my stomach to the pins and needles of anticipation, this book put me in my happy place.I honestly loved everything about The Love Hypothesis. It was filled with humor, heart, romance, wonderful characters, and clever writing. If you've already read this book, you know what I'm talking about, but if you haven't read it yet, do yourself a favor and read it! I promise that you won't be disappointed.This is one of the best books that I’ve read this year!\n\n"", '\n\n  “I wish you could see yourself the way I see you.”What You’ll Find:✔️Quirky Romance✔️Fake Relationship✔️Heroine in STEM✔️Broody Hero✔️Single POVMINI REVIEWThis one has been hyped all over bookstagram. So I gave in, it sounded cute, and buddy read it with some lovelies. But for me, it didn’t quite live up to the hype. Hear me out, it’s a sweet read, and I did enjoy it. It just had a slow start for me, feeling younger than I expected. And the chapters are LONG y’all, and felt that much longer in the beginning. The second half is where it really drew me in, and I felt as though I got through the chapters much quicker!I was sure this was a closed door romance. I just didn’t feel the tension or chemistry others seemed to feel. And I NEED to feel that. It goes from fake kissing and holding hands, to an abrupt flip to FULL steam ahead! There was no real build up. Not that I think every romance needs steam, but the steam in this one is ultimately what helped me feel their romance and connection finally. In the end, a cute read. And a solid debut, with what I think will result in promising stories to come from this author.\n\n', '\n\n  Boy, did this book ever live up to the hype! I absolutely LOVED it! It was so refreshing to read a rom-com set in academia. I loved all the academic references, from getting excited about lit searches to mentions of predatory journal emails (LOL do we ever get a lot of those!). I also loved that the heroine was Canadian (The jokes about the metric system killed me, though I’ve never heard of people eating moose heart. It hurts <i>my</i> heart to think of doing that to such a majestic creature 😩)I love both the heroine and the hero in this book so much. The heroine is relatable, and not just because she’s a female scientist (I’m not a scientist, but my first two degrees were in the sciences). I am a huge fan of the grumpy/sunshine trope, and while this book doesn’t quite fit that mold, I love how curmudgeonly Adam is. The entire book is told through Olive’s point of view, and I enjoyed how, as a reader, I could still infer what Adam was thinking the entire time.While the plot is quite predictable, I didn’t care one iota. I freaking loved every single page!5 million stars!\n\n']"

I will try to avoid spoilers because the book takes a lot of twists.The book isn’t so much a novel as a series of vignettes, half of them going through the years prior to the opening scene.  The second half, interleaved with the first, are the chronicles of the protagonist, going on from that first scene.  For those familiar with The Martian, we again see the universe, and Murphy, working together to present endless challenges which our hero defeats (for the most part) with the diligent application of Science.  The book is wrtten almost entirely  in the first person.  Each of the scenes are easy reads, and many I read multiple times, because they’re fun!  (Court battle.)While this format is distracting it is entertaining.  It probably slowed my reading down, which could be good or bad.The author uses foreshadowing ... alot.  At least half the twists i saw coming.  Between that, and Murphy, you knew when things were going well, it was going to crash.But it was STILL an easy and very entertaining book.\n\n', ""\n\n  Having read The Martian and seen the movie, I was anxious and excited to read Project Hail Mary. First, let me explore some of the problems causing mixed reviews. It is very heavy on science and technology. I thought the explanations by Andy Weir were difficult to follow for anyone without a strong background in mathematics, physics, chemistry or astronomy. Still, the author did this as well as possible. I found I did not need to fully follow the explanations to be along on the wild ride through space. It was sufficient to read about the actions, danger, and problems faced. I found the story so exciting and thought-provoking that it was enough for me to follow what was happening and be captivated by the suspense and tension without understanding the scientific theories involved. I imagine that readers with a strong background in science or math might enjoy fact-checking the accuracy of the explanations, but this is not necessary to believe this thrilling story. The earth is facing annihilation in the not-too-distant future. Alien microorganisms, astrophages, are absorbing energy from the sun. The sun is cooling, and it is predicted that this will lead to an ice age, famines, wars for resources, and the eventual extinction of most of the life on earth. There seems to be a glimmer of hope on a planet, Tau Ceti, in a distant solar system. This is the only place discovered where astrophages are being destroyed. The Petrova task force has been set up consisting of the worlds' greatest minds from many nations. They establish Project Hail Mary under the leadership and authority of the director (dictator) Eva Stratt. She is driven to save the world from impending catastrophe at all costs. What she possesses in authority puts her on a power trip. She is cold-hearted, lacks scruples and willing to set aside legalities, morality and ethics to achieve her goals. She will select a three-person crew of the best scientists and astronauts capable of withstanding a prolonged coma on their long one-way suicide journey into interstellar space. Sometime in the future, aboard the spaceship Hail Mary, Ryland Grace awakens from an induced coma. Tubes, electrodes and IV lines are attached to his body. Nearby are the mummified bodies of his two crewmates. He cannot recall his name, where he is, or why he is there. As his physical body gains strength, he recovers snippets of memory of the past.He was a dedicated, enthusiastic, and popular Junior High science teacher whose work was inspiring to his students. He had few friends.  How did he come to be selected for this mission, and for what purpose?  He is horrified to learn he is somewhere in deep space with no way back to earth.  He knows he doesn't want to die, but there is no way home with insufficient food and fuel. His two crewmates could have explained the mission and helped him, but they are dead. He realizes this will soon be his solitary fate. As bits of his memory and thoughts begin to clarify, we learn more about his life and how he got to be on this mission into outer space. If only he could remember what he is supposed to do now! He makes contact with a masterful engineer and mechanic named Rocky. To say more about this endearing and wonderful character would be a spoiler.  Ryland Grace has a snide, witty, and sarcastic sense of humour, usually directed at himself. It is a wild, exciting journey towards his destination, Tau Ceti. The ride is full of danger, twists and excitement. Through his tireless ingenuity, he manages to overcome obstacles never before faced by anyone. Does Grace muddle through and save the earth?  What difficult choice must now face him?  Of all the endings I could envision, I never thought of its fantastical conclusion which was most unexpected and satisfying for me.\n\n"", '\n\n  As I got into Andy Weir\'s latest, early on I decided on four stars as the first person narrative was very close in style to Mark Watney in ""The Martian""  I almost expected the character to be revealed as him!  But in the end, this was such a fun, creative yarn that it gets the full five stars from me!  Great premise, great science, great ......... (avoiding spoiler).  In my eyes, the author is formally redeemed from ""Artemis"".  Looking forward to the next - seems open to a sequel!\n\n', '\n\n  Amazing!... or as Rocky would say, ""Amaze! Amaze! Amaze!""I was a huge fan of The Martian. I especially liked how Andy Weir ""did the math"" in that story to describe technical problems and their solutions. Even though I\'m terrible at math and it was my worst subject in school, the author makes it so approachable and interesting. So when I learned that Andy Weir had written an interstellar, alien first-contact novel, I was concerned that he would focus on the dramatic and get less into the guts of individual problems and the details of their solutions. I am pleased to say that my concerns were unfounded.The story is compelling from start to finish and, although it includes the techie stuff that I like, character development was superb, the drama was intense, and the emotional aspects of the story were compelling.Overall, Project Hail Mary is the best book that I have read this year, and possibly ever!\n\n', '\n\n  I read this book in 2 days which is rare for me. I couldn’t put it down.It is a fun and fast moving book. There is a fair amount of science and technical jargon but not enough to put off the average reader.It is a well told story and even though it isn’t the Martian, it is a very worthwhile read.\n\n', '\n\n  I have become an Andy Weir fan, on the basis of his earlier books, *The Martian* and *Artemis,* and I didn\'t know what to expect with his latest book. The title didn\'t particularly ""grab"" me. But immediately upon opening it, I was hooked. The protagonist, who tells the story in the first person, wakes up in an unknown environment, with only two corpses and a set of mechanical arms for company, and he has no idea where he is, or even his name and identity. So the story begins with the hero\'s first experiments to uncover his whereabouts, and short flashbacks as he begins to remember bits and pieces of his past history. That may sound a bit off-putting - it shouldn\'t be! Weir is a rivetting writer, and he includes much dry humor, and the book is not just a solo journey for long - I will say no more! MOST highly recommended!\n\n', '\n\n  Familiar Weir first person perspective tells a story of another reluctant hero with an unusual sidekick named Rocky. They help each other and work together to save their people. Mostly this is a funny, engaging story of two aliens forging a friendship. Exciting and hilarious, this is well worth the read for any nerdy science geek but also anyone who has ever dreamed of space travel.\n\n']"

At this point, I sound like a broken record, but it NEEDS to be made abundantly clear that Lark is one of the most talented romance authors of our time.While Lark started with mafia romance and succeeded in writing exceptional books, such as The Spy and Brutal Prince, this new endeavour only serves to prove her literary prowess.Serial killer romance books are notoriously difficult to execute, and especially difficult to execute well. The author has to dance on the fine line between love and hate, moreso than any enemies-to-lovers requires. The killer must be ruthless enough to despise but human enough to understand, and ultimately fall for.Cole Blackwell is one of the best examples of this that I've ever seen. The way his chapters prove his moral compass, or lack thereof, is mesmerizing. The way he easily admits that he hasn't killed a woman, not because it goes against a moral code, but because none have made it worth his time, is one of the my favourite parts about Cole.Lark has several fantastic skills. Building universes, developing morally grey characters (and ensuring the reader can love them), writing smut that leaves the reader breathless, and, of course, the spectacular narration style that is so uniquely LARK. My only qualm with this book, and the reason it's not a 5/5, is the plot. I think Lark could have done better because I've read so many of her other books where she DOES so much better. There Are No Saints set the bar high, and while There Is No Devil meets some of the expectations set, its story falls a little flat after the tidal wave of the first book.I would have loved to see more interaction between Shaw and our MCs. I think after so much buildup, it was a bit cruel to not have Shaw be more present in this book. I kept waiting for Lark to wow me with the story, similar to how she's done in the past with Kingmakers and Brutal Birthright, but instead I found myself disappointed.Perhaps I'm being a bit harsh, after all, this is a romance novel and the cardinal rule of this genre is that there must be a guaranteed HEA. BUT, I wanted Lark to push the boundaries. I wanted an ending that shocked me. I wanted to be taken aback by the plot, enraptured to find out what happened next, like I was with the first book, but that was not what happened.I think that this book is sort of like the calm after the storm. The hurricane that was the first book may have influenced my mind into thinking that the inclement weather would last forever.Mara and Cole are layered, complex, phenomenal characters. Mara's sensory issues, which I heavily relate to, heighten the efficacy of the delivery when Lark is describing the various sensations Mara feels. Cole's drive to constantly push Mara to be the star he knows she can be is beautifully written. At a glance, these characters are flawed and could be considered broken, but as we explore the depths of their minds, we find that they are only bent, waiting for the other to right them.Lark does another thing extremely well, and that is making the reader feel immersed in the setting. Her apt descriptions of places, people, decorations, rooms, and so on, are brilliantly done. As with every Lark book, this one played like a movie in my mind, and I've never even been to California.Overall, this is a superb duet. I recommend it and I hope to see Lark continue to expand the range of her works.\n\n"", ""\n\n  This is the brilliant conclusion to this masterpiece bathed in darkness and light, joy and pain, love and hate. And since one doesn't exist without the other, so does Cole need Mara. This is an interesting, fast-paced, and incredibly steamy conclusion  that will absolutely etch Cole and Mara as favorite characters in our memories forever.\n\n"", ""\n\n  This is one enthralling read that captivated me in the first book and blew me with this finale. On the surface this seems a serial killer book but is so much deeper. The beautiful descriptions of Mara's childhood as told in art were incredible.  The relationship that grows between Cole and Mara was compelling. Incredible read.\n\n"", '\n\n  A duet requires two whether it is two books or two characters. As usual Sophie does not disappoint. The changes that Cole and Mara go through are pivotal to the story and provide the pinnacle transformation needed to keep us on the edge. Another extremely  satisfying offering by the creative and talented Sophie Lark.\n\n', '\n\n  *SPOILERS* OMG. First off this series is dark and twisted and may not be for all readers. That being said I loved it. Cole and Mara are this awesome couple who are twisted in their revenge on those who hurt them. They are 2 soul halves that complete eachother. Sophie Lark keep up the amazing work!\n\n', '\n\n  I honestly did not expect to enjoy this book. Way out of the norm for me. However, it was this perfect blend of philosophy and soulmates. I’m off to read more from this author to make sure this duet wasn’t a fluke.  Going in with much more excitement and expectation this time around. ❤️\n\n', '\n\n  Cole and Mara were each the missing piece the other needed.  The crazy to the others storm. I loved how they settled the trouble within the other and everything made perfect sense.  Loved their story.\n\n', '\n\n  Sophie Lark has done it again. She has created two characters that seem nothing alike but share a deeper connection. You can’t help but fall in love with their journey! A must read series!!\n\n']"

Turns out, the answer is, A LOT! And all in a good way! I absolutely LOVED this book. It is bolder, darker, sexier and taps into the lore and mythology way more. The gods play pivotal roles and each one has a distinct personality. I couldn't get enough!Seeing the darkness in Hades, his skewed moral compass and the secrets he has and continues to keep from Persephone make him a far more layered character. He isn't just a sex, brooding god, but a man with complex and uncertain emotions who will do anything for his lady. I loved his interactions with Hecate and Hermes, who have officially become my favourite side characters. There were new scenes added to familiar ones, which amplified the steam ten fold.The plot has so much going on, so many unique threads that change how scenes in ATOD unfolded. I thought it was cleverly done and it was a joy to read. The banter and chemistry between the two leads was fantastic and they are becoming one of my favourite bookish couples. There were also side plots and threads left open for future books, and I can't wait to see how they tie together.A Game of Fate is perfect for anyone who loves new, urban takes on mythology and legends, super steamy fated romance, and morally grey heroes who keep their secrets close to their hearts. I can't wait to see what happens next!\n\n"", ""\n\n  Well, ohh my flippin glorious gods!!!! This is Hades' POV but it is so much more than that. Once you've read Touch of darkness, Touch of Ruin, and Touch of Malice, PLEASE PLEASE read this book! I need the rest of the books, like now 😫Ughhhh...... his thoughts, his intentions, his fears, it gives you so much more than that, and man do I love him even more than I did in the Persephone's POV. You also get to see other sides of the supporting characters interactions with Hades, and just wow..... I laughed SO much in this book and ahh... the butterflies I got, there was a couple times where I also squealed like a school girl because of them, no joke.I love how you can see his sense of humour more so in this book and its just so hot! Soo hot.......You get to see how he runs his Underworld and how he feels about his Upperworld  ventures. Very cool book if you ask me, I really enjoyed it. Cant wait for the rest of the books. They can't come fast enough. I will definitely be reading more from this author!\n\n"", '\n\n  This is so much more then just his side, it’s an entire story unto it self. It’s Hades story, his truths, his darkness, strengths (weaknesses shhh 🤫 don’t tell him I told) and how he learned to open him self up and be vulnerable.Some pain is deep, some truths we hide from our selfs. He was  helping build Sephy‘a confidence and helping her to see her value and her strengths. While she was destroying the walls and repairing his heart. 🖤🔥🖤🔥\n\n', ""\n\n  This is a touch of Darkness retold from Hades pov. At first I was skeptical that it was just going to be a boring retelling of a story I've already read but I think I enjoyed it more than Persephones pov! Hades is complex and sexy and the added scenes really flesh out the whole love story. You get more insight to his motives. This book definitely did not fell like a rehash of an already published book. It was so much more and so fun to read! In love with this series and can't wait for more Hades and Persephone!\n\n"", '\n\n  I’m so glad that I read this book! I love the first two books of the series and in anticipation of the third book coming out in a few days, I thought I’d read this to get me back into the universe. This book made me love Hades even more! I also liked his storyline that we didn’t get to see in Persephone’s POV. Highly recommend!!!\n\n', '\n\n  For fans of ACOTAR & Crescent City, or TOG, to Cassandra Clare or Blood & Honey, this is for you. In the second instalment of Persephone x Hades, which is technically like book 1.5 - book one from Hades’ view - we get a back door feel to what was happening in his world. I am usually not a fan of this type of storyline, however I was elated to read on. The book covers main plot points from the first but really follows how they arrived at those points. Really well written to discover more about Hades.\n\n', '\n\n  Now this book is exactly what I have wanted since the first book. The writing was strong, the plot was great, and I loved reading the lengths Hades would go through to have and protect Persephone!\n\n', '\n\n  Excellent addition to the HXP story, this time from Hades perspective. I recommend reading in combination, or right before/after ATOD\n\n']"

  When paramedics find a malnourished six-year-old boy near a burning car that holds a dead woman, they wonder who he is—and why he won't speak. From the New York Times bestselling author of The Mountain Between Us comes a story of self-discovery, healing, and hope.On a stifling summer day, an old Chevy Impala ignored the warning signals and was annihilated by the oncoming train. What no one realized until much later was that the driver had paused just before entering the tracks and kicked a small boy out of the car. A small boy with broken glasses who is clutching a notebook with all his might . . . but who never speaks.Chase Walker was one of the lucky ones. He was in foster care as a child, but he finally ended up with a family who loved him and cared for him. Now, as a journalist for the local paper, he’s moved on and put the past behind him. But when he’s assigned the story of this young boy, painful, haunting questions about his own childhood begin to rise to the surface.And as Chase Walker discovers, learning the truth about who you are can be as elusive—and as magical—as chasing fireflies on a summer night.Praise for Chasing Fireflies:“Colorful, memorable characters; Southern regional flavor that’s drop-dead accurate; and lyrical, intelligent writing make Chasing Fireflies an exceptionally good read.” —Aspiring Retail“Martin understands the power of story and he uses it to alter the souls and lives of both his characters and his readers . . .”—Patti Callahan Henry, New York Times bestselling authorFull-length emotive Southern fictionIncludes discussion questions for book clubsBonus excerpt from Long Way GoneAlso by Charles Martin: The Water Keeper, The Mountain Between Us, Send Down the Rain, and When Crickets Cry  Read more  ","['5.0 out of 5 stars', '5.0 out of 5 stars', '4.0 out of 5 stars', '5.0 out of 5 stars', '5.0 out of 5 stars', '5.0 out of 5 stars', '5.0 out of 5 stars', '5.0 out of 5 stars']","['\nan exceptionally well written story\n', '\nGreat author\n', '\nAnother good read by a good author\n', '\nBeautifully written - good story\n', '\nA great read\n', '\nBrilliant\n', '\nFive Stars\n', '\nGerry S\n']","['\n\n  I read 3 novels every wk, and this is a standout book among the many dozens upon dozens I have read in recent years.

  When a pseudonymous programmer introduced “a new electronic cash system that’s fully peer-to-peer, with no trusted third party” to a small online mailing list in 2008, very few paid attention. Ten years later, and against all odds, this upstart autonomous decentralized software offers an unstoppable and globally-accessible hard money alternative to modern central banks. The Bitcoin Standard analyzes the historical context to the rise of Bitcoin, the economic properties that have allowed it to grow quickly, and its likely economic, political, and social implications. While Bitcoin is a new invention of the digital age, the problem it purports to solve is as old as human society itself: transferring value across time and space. Ammous takes the reader on an engaging journey through the history of technologies performing the functions of money, from primitive systems of trading limestones and seashells, to metals, coins, the gold standard, and modern government debt. Exploring what gave these technologies their monetary role, and how most lost it, provides the reader with a good idea of what makes for sound money, and sets the stage for an economic discussion of its consequences for individual and societal future-orientation, capital accumulation, trade, peace, culture, and art. Compellingly, Ammous shows that it is no coincidence that the loftiest achievements of humanity have come in societies enjoying the benefits of sound monetary regimes, nor is it coincidental that monetary collapse has usually accompanied civilizational collapse. With this background in place, the book moves on to explain the operation of Bitcoin in a functional and intuitive way. Bitcoin is a decentralized, distributed piece of software that converts electricity and processing power into indisputably accurate records, thus allowing its users to utilize the Internet to perform the traditional functions of money without having to rely on, or trust, any authorities or infrastructure in the physical world. Bitcoin is thus best understood as the first successfully implemented form of digital cash and digital hard money. With an automated and perfectly predictable monetary policy, and the ability to perform final settlement of large sums across the world in a matter of minutes, Bitcoin’s real competitive edge might just be as a store of value and network for final settlement of large payments—a digital form of gold with a built-in settlement infrastructure. Ammous’ firm grasp of the technological possibilities as well as the historical realities of monetary evolution provides for a fascinating exploration of the ramifications of voluntary free market money. As it challenges the most sacred of government monopolies, Bitcoin shifts the pendulum of sovereignty away from governments in favor of individuals, offering us the tantalizing possibility of a world where money is fully extricated from politics and unrestrained by borders. The final chapter of the book explores some of the most common questions surrounding Bitcoin: Is Bitcoin mining a waste of energy? Is Bitcoin for criminals? Who controls Bitcoin, and can they change it if they please? How can Bitcoin be killed? And what to make of all the thousands of Bitcoin knock-offs, and the many supposed applications of Bitcoin’s ‘blockchain technology’? The Bitcoin Standard is the essential resource for a clear understanding of the rise of the Internet’s decentralized, apolitical, free-market alternative to national central banks.

It has been for me.In this pragmatic coverage of monetary history and economics, the author, Saifedean Ammous, eloquently reveals what makes money, and why it matters for human societies.This book pierces through the opacity of the multi-decade fiat currency experiments held by many countries all around the world. Consuming this writing will most likely trigger you to question a core axiom about the current financial system: should nations be sovereign and control money? As you advance in the reading, you will come to realize that government-issued money is a historical outlier—a 90 years old societal anomaly. Bitcoin is introduced as what it is slowly becoming: the next global reserve currency and settlement network—free of governmental agents manipulating it.That book is the start of the Bitcoin rabbit hole for many, as it was for me. I highly recommend it to anyone who is interested to learn about the monetary evolution we are seeing unfold in front of us. Along this book, Bitcoin will most likely morph your thinking around economics, money, human societies, nutrition, art and many other things. All these subject matters may not seem related at the moment, but they are.Enough said. Enjoy!\n\n', '\n\n  I\'m only on chapter 8, where he finally gets to Bitcoin, but all the preceding chapters have been an eye opener. (I thought Keynes was supposed to be a bona fide economist; instead he seems to have been many other things, most of them unsavoury.)If you\'re of the Austrian School, you will love this book. Fascinating.I\'ll try to get back and update this when I\'m done.UPDATEFinished reading the book. The title of this review should now be Great book on money, BitCoin, and cryptocurrencies..The author cuts through so much of the enormous hype surrounding this technology, and the semi-mythical origns of BitCoin. He gives a clear, straightforward discussion of what makes bc special and its strengths and weaknesses (no it is NOT for buying lattes at Starbucks, regardless of how hip that might make you look; yes it makes an excellent digital store of value and could well become digital gold if it is not already that).He gives logical reasons for why no other alt coin so far can compete with bc or is likely to dethrone it.He does not enlighten us as to who or what Nakamoto actually is, but interestingly shows how this missing, anonymous creator of bc is actually another point in its favor.And all that ""wasted"" electricity? Well, that is part of what justifies the whole thing, and becomes a matter of your point of view.I think my favorite aspect of the book, aside from his take on gold, was how beautifully he explains that bc is now, effectively, a living thing with a life of its own and beyond anyone\'s control. If Satoshi is a single person, he is a genius.The one thing the author failed to show, and that is one of my main concerns, is how bc can be considered beyond the reach of government and its bankster masters. Sure, They can\'t ever get control of bc, but kill it? That is another story. If anything, the author shows WHY They would want to do that. BitCoin is money they can\'t control. He does suggest that central banks could start to buy and horde bc, just as they do gold now. I ask: But would it be cost effective to print even more of their fake money to corner the bc market? We\'ll see.One more thing: Refreshingly, compared to so many websites, blogs, YT channels, etc., the author never promotes  bc; he is always realistic about its pitfalls and problems and what a risky investment it has been and will continue to be.\n\n', ""\n\n  When I picked up this book I thought it was about Bitcoin.  It's so much more.  This is by far the best book I've ever read on the history of money and economics.  Saifedean Ammous manages to lay out information in a way that allows you to build a context or framework from which you can better understand what is going on in the world today.  The book covers everything from the Roman Empire to the formation of Constantinople to how WWI was funded and the Bretton Woods Act of 1944.  It is one of the most important books I've ever read and have purchased multiple copies to hand out to family and friends. Understanding money's role in our past has helped me feel better about our future ... even with all the challenges ahead.  My personal view of Bitcoin has completely changed.  Thank you for taking the time to write this Saifedean.  It's very much appreciated.\n\n"", '\n\n  I did not expect a lesson in economics when I picked up this book. But, the author makes the concepts of economics as they apply to his chosen subject matter simpler to understand.Definitely a worthwhile read for those interested in the rise of FIAT currency. This book explores the more recent birth of Bitcoin. Discussing the fact that Bitcoin addresses several of the challenges faced with government money.\n\n', '\n\n  Saifedean makes a great case here as to the value of sound money to create and maintain civilization. He then explains how Bitcoin fulfills the requirements of sound money even better than gold did during the gold standard era. An absolute must for anyone seeking an understanding of what makes Bitcoin valuable and how it can change our world for the better.\n\n', '\n\n  After a great introduction to monetary theory, I was looking forward to coverage of BitCoin that extended beyond the usual technical breakdown. Unfortunately the author goes down a rabbit hole of Keynes bashing and proselytising the Austrian school and the Gold Standard, ultimately failing to deliver much of substance on Bitcoin.\n\n', '\n\n  Took a while to reach but the delivery estimate was accurate. Nice quality book. Didn’t read it yet but looks like a good read. Bought it because of the reviews. Expensive but good quality.\n\n', '\n\n  Understandable teaching about money and what is required for a good to become money.  Explains the monetary policy of Bitcoin and how it compares with other money.  Author has a no-nonsense style which I appreciated for this subject.\n\n']"

  NOW A MAJOR MOTION PICTURE directed by Denis Villeneuve, starring Timothée Chalamet, Zendaya, Jason Momoa, Rebecca Ferguson, Oscar Isaac, Josh Brolin, Stellan Skarsgård, Dave Bautista, David Dastmalchian, Stephen McKinley Henderson, Chang Chen, Sharon Duncan-Brewster, Charlotte Rampling, and Javier Bardem.Frank Herbert’s classic masterpiece—a triumph of the imagination and one of the bestselling science fiction novels of all time.Set on the desert planet Arrakis, Dune is the story of the boy Paul Atreides, heir to a noble family tasked with ruling an inhospitable world where the only thing of value is the “spice” melange, a drug capable of extending life and enhancing consciousness. Coveted across the known universe, melange is a prize worth killing for....When House Atreides is betrayed, the destruction of Paul’s family will set the boy on a journey toward a destiny greater than he could ever have imagined. And as he evolves into the mysterious man known as Muad’Dib, he will bring to fruition humankind’s most ancient and unattainable dream. A stunning blend of adventure and mysticism, environmentalism and politics, Dune won the first Nebula Award, shared the Hugo Award, and formed the basis of what is undoubtedly the grandest epic in science fiction.

Bad guys are so demonstrably evil for no justifiable merit. Lots of characters talking about prophecy.Reading the first few chapters is a slog, and the main character\'s POV isn\'t explored more congruently until much, much later in the book. Most of the adult characters are characteurs or stilted, often internally monologueing to themselves ad nauseum about their distrust in others. Problem with the book is unfortunately the first 1/4 of this is that, and it makes it hard to penetrate into the later parts of the book with Dune, the Freman, and the evolving plot. The backstory of the adults is relatively unnecessary. Later on, the book is its own ""this will be a series"" and ""spoiler alerts,"" so it struggles to live on its own, not that I\'m invested in these people to begin with. Author kills a child with such little fanfare by the other characters at one point. There is a lot of ""it works because we say so"" mechanics that the reader is forced to accept.The one thing that is consistently modern was the discussions on ecology and water preservation. Even more relevant today than it was back then, and I appreciate the extent of research the author put into it. Impressive. Once the 1/3rd of the book comes along, the Freman lifestyle is explored, then I found myself more engaged in it, could read through it. But that first bit is rough.\n\n', '\n\n  This is the third time I read the book. This is the book that inspired George Lucas\' Star Wars and George RR Martin\'s game of Thrones. Enough said.This is NOT an adventure sci-fi book. It\'s more like an intrigue novel à la GoT, in a futuristic environment. Don\'t get me wrong, the sci-fi part is amazing, everything is there for a reason and can be ""explained""\n\n', ""\n\n  Only about halfway through the book, it has been absolutely amazing so far. But this review is not about the content. halfway through the book and I have come across 2 pages that are illegible! as if the printer broke and ink spilt all over the page. It is not a deal break for me, but it pains me to think about what I could be missing in those three pages!I recommend the book highly, but maybe don't buy this version of it.\n\n"", '\n\n  I haven’t finished it yet, I’m part way through part 2, but I find the story far really boring. This could be possibly because I’m more interested in fantasy books I don’t know. I’ve read other sci-fi’s like the TekWar, The Martian and those were really exciting.I haven’t picked up the book in a week and I’m considering reading something else.I may try to finish it before the movie at least, we’ll see.\n\n', '\n\n  Buy the book. The story in this book is very intriguing. My lower rating doesn’t reflect on this amazing book. My rating reflects the shape I received my book in. Bent pages and cover. So if you want a collectors copy, be aware.\n\n', ""\n\n  If you've never read Frank Herbert's 'Dune' you owe it to yourself to give it a go.  Honestly, it gets branded as science fiction all the time but there's actually not much of that about it, other than it taking place in the far future.  It's a story about a noble-born young lad who becomes a messiah figure, and all the politics, warmongering and intrigue that surround him.  Also honestly, it wasn't as good a read as the first time I took it in (forty years ago) but I have, after all, thumbed my way through a heck of a lot of books since then so I guess it simply has more competition now.  With the new movie version by the execrable Villeneuve—who will doubtless turn Dune into Dung—coming along I decided to revisit this classic tale and I enjoyed it again.  Recommended.\n\n"", '\n\n  I love Sci-fi Fantasy and this did not disappoint. I have read quite a few series now, including, ‘Thomas Covenant’ and ‘The Ara’Aki’ and thought it was time to read the well known Dune. It takes you to a completely different world, draws you into the plot with intriguing characters that you come to care about. The setting on Arrakis is unique, along with all the circumstances that come with a planet in which there is little water, i.e. surviving with a stillsuit. I would highly recommend this book and series to sci-fi genre lovers.\n\n', '\n\n  Dune is a great introduction to the series. You can read it as a stand-alone in anticipation to the film but the story really spans throughout the 6 books. There’s a lot to unpack but Herbert is a very accessible writer so even if you’re not an avid reader it’s an enjoyable read. It can be dense with the lore and characters but following an audiobook helps since there are voice actors to help distinguish characters. Read dune and then messiah and then children of dune and so on and so forth.\n\n']"

  #1 NEW YORK TIMES BESTSELLER • From the author of Small Great Things and The Book of Two Ways comes “a powerfully evocative story of resilience and the triumph of the human spirit” (Taylor Jenkins Reid, author of Malibu Rising) Rights sold to Netflix for adaptation as a feature filmDiana O’Toole is perfectly on track. She will be married by thirty, done having kids by thirty-five, and move out to the New York City suburbs, all while climbing the professional ladder in the cutthroat art auction world. She’s an associate specialist at Sotheby’s now, but her boss has hinted at a promotion if she can close a deal with a high-profile client. She’s not engaged just yet, but she knows her boyfriend, Finn, a surgical resident, is about to propose on their romantic getaway to the Galápagos—days before her thirtieth birthday. Right on time.But then a virus that felt worlds away has appeared in the city, and on the eve of their departure, Finn breaks the news: It’s all hands on deck at the hospital. He has to stay behind. You should still go, he assures her, since it would be a shame for all of their nonrefundable trip to go to waste. And so, reluctantly, she goes.Almost immediately, Diana’s dream vacation goes awry. Her luggage is lost, the Wi-Fi is nearly nonexistent, and the hotel they’d booked is shut down due to the pandemic. In fact, the whole island is now under quarantine, and she is stranded until the borders reopen. Completely isolated, she must venture beyond her comfort zone. Slowly, she carves out a connection with a local family when a teenager with a secret opens up to Diana, despite her father’s suspicion of outsiders.In the Galápagos Islands, where Darwin’s theory of evolution by natural selection was formed, Diana finds herself examining her relationships, her choices, and herself—and wondering if when she goes home, she too will have evolved into someone completely different.

Highest praise\n', '\nThought provoking\n', '\nanother great read from Jodi Picoult\n', '\nAwesome\n', '\nAll. The. Stars.\n']","[""\n\n  Brilliant and stunning. I preordered this book months ago when I saw it was about a trip to the Galapagos. I visited the islands 30 years ago, and memories of that enchanting place are still fresh in my mind. Unfortunately, a couple of the early reviews I read gave away the mind-boggling twist but did not interfere with my reading pleasure when the book was finally published. No twists were revealed in this review. This deals with the horror of COVID in heartbreaking, riveting storytelling. Wish You Were Here explores the world that changed almost two years ago when the pandemic entered our lives. It addresses loss, grief, death, pain, isolation, resilience, hope, dreams, sexual identity, and art. It is well-researched on a scientific level but also has some powerful metaphysical themes. This emotional read brought me to tears, and I had to resist a strong urge to peek at the final chapter. Diana O'Toole is approaching her 30th birthday. She has her life well planned and is on a path where everything she hoped for is falling into place. She has decided to be married by age 30 and have two children by the time she is 35. She shares an apartment in New York City with her boyfriend, Finn, a handsome surgical resident. She knows that he is going to propose marriage on an upcoming romantic vacation in the Galapagos. Their future plans are right on schedule. They will live in upper New York and have a bucket list for future travel, children, and a dog. Diana works for Sotheby's in the art acquisition field. She has a new wealthy celebrity client (easily identified as Yoko Ono under a different name.) By selling her valuable painting, she is bound to be awarded a prestigious promotion at the auction house. What could go wrong?  The time is early 2020, and the pandemic has reached NYC. The world we are living in is about to change drastically. So far, there are 19 patients in the hospital with the disease. Finn has been warned that it will rapidly become much worse, despite the denial of President Trump of danger. As the sick and dying flood into the hospital where Finn is working, he cannot leave on holiday. He urges Diana to go on her own since the trip is already paid for. Diana has not gone to movies or a restaurant by herself. Besides Finn, her main friend and confidant is a flamboyant, gay black man, also an employee of the auction house. He plays an important part later in the story. Diana accepts Finn's wish that she travel to the Galapagos on her own for the two-week vacation. This suggestion takes her firmly out of her comfort zone, but she is determined to follow his suggestion and heads to Isabela Island in the Galapagos by herself. As the hospital becomes overwhelmed by patients, Finn is afraid, sleepless, and very stressed. He resents that Diana followed his suggestion rather than staying in their apartment to comfort him when he returns home after long hours on duty and the hopelessness of it all.  He thought she would reject his advice. Frontline workers, like Finn, have shown great heroism during the pandemic. When Diana arrives on Isabela Island, tourists are rushing to leave the Galapagos. It is going into lockdown. Diana is determined to prove herself by staying the two weeks. Her luggage was lost in route. She does not understand the language. Her prepaid hotel is locked down, as are the shops and restaurants. Worse. The banks are closed, and there is no ATM. She does not have sufficient cash on her person. All communication with the outside world is unreliable and spotty. She wants to confirm that she can cope. While wandering in distress, trying to figure what to do, a kindly, older lady leads Diana into her home. People are distant at first because she is an outsider and tourist. As the two-week lockdown is extended and there is no way to leave, they regard her as one of their own. She gradually makes friends with the son of the homeowner. He is a gruff, charismatic man who has a small farm and his daughter, an unhappy, self-harming 14-year-old. She is developing close bonds with these people. She is delighted to explore the wonders of the island with her new friends. The animal life, the landscape, the volcanoes, swimming in the clear waters amongst penguins and sea lions. Nature is described in vivid, atmospheric detail. As the weeks pass, Diana is feeling quite content in her surroundings. Her time there is not without problems. She has written postcards to Finn, assuring him that everything is fine and that she misses him. These were never posted as promised. She is unable to reach him by phone. She gets occasional text messages from him describing the sickness and the horrors he is witnessing and his resentment that she didn't remain home with him. She also must face the news that her much absent and neglectful mother, a Pulitizer Prize-winning photojournalist, had died in a nursing home with early-onset dementia in Diana's absence. She is re-evaluating her life choices, her well-planned schedule, and her past hopes and dreams. She is evolving a new, different identity while trying to work out what is important to her. She is in no hurry to leave the island and her new friends. One day, while swimming in the ocean, she almost drowns and is rescued close to death. Then something very unexpected and shocking occurs that makes us doubt everything we thought we knew. I loved this book, with its location, well-developed, fascinating characters, unexpected revelations, unique plot, and thought-provoking storyline. Some people will find the description of the pandemic too disturbing at this point in time. Highly recommended for readers who can cope with intense images of the chaos inside the hospital wards.\n\n"", ""\n\n  I thought it might be too soon for this subject matter, but I trust the author.  I'm glad I did.  She brought up possibilities and angles that I had never considered during all this.  Not to mention giving us all some excellent advice about how we live our lives, and how we need to examine that from time to time.  Well done.\n\n"", '\n\n  timely and interesting, easy read\n\n', '\n\n  This is by far one of the best books I have read in 2021. I highly recommend it\n\n', ""\n\n  Oh where do I begin with this perfectly beautiful book!? It was everything I want in a novel. Diana goes on a trip alone to the Galápagos Islands,  to avoid losing the money she and her boyfriend spent on the vacation of a lifetime. Finn stays home in New York just as covid hits because he is a doctor and is needed at the hospital. He thinks Diana will be out of harms way while there. The trip gets off to a rocky start, first Diana's luggage is lost, there is no wifi, cell phone connections are almost non-existent and the entire island is going into lockdown. Luckily Diana meets Abdula, her son Gabriel and her granddaughter Beatriz. They help her with food, shelter, companionship and how to navigate the island. One day she and Gabriel go snorkeling and Diana believes she is going to drown...that's where the real story begins.This book read like non-fiction which is understandable seeing as Ms. Picoult based it on a man who got stuck in the Galápagos Islands during lock-down and of course covid being very real these days. The storyline was so heartbreaking and raw and real, while reading these pages I felt so many emotions and loved getting a doctors point of view on covid. This will definitely be one of my favourite reads of the year. I finished it days ago and it is still with me, it is one I won't soon forget, that's for sure. I highly recommend this read to everyone.\n\n""]"

I must confess that even with its excellent writing style and world-building, the story did not manage to thoroughly hook me before the halfway mark, and nothing else but its slow pacing is to blame for that. Nevertheless, looking retrospectively, I am quite relieved to have felt that way as every seed that was sowed and the multitude of stories told, many regarded as legends, all expertly solidify to an overwhelming sense of accomplishment and relief.Sometimes I could barely distinguish reality from fiction, while immersed in this epic tale. The scattered fragments of worldbuilding and characterization finally coalesce, in the latter half, into a world so real and complex that might just exist somewhere out in the universe, and characters that might as well exist besides you, leading their way into a journey I could not help but feel part of.  I haven't experienced this, to this extent, in any other books. That I can safely say.The conclusion is bittersweet and surprised me with the lack of dramatic cliffhangers. That will not fool me, though, as the subtleties sprinkled throughout the book strained the notion that every decision and interaction can provoke irreversible and drastic changes in the Pattern. Needless to say that I will keep reading this amazing story, and can not wait to peer into what the Wheel has weaved around the Two Rivers' folk.\n\n"", '\n\n  There are ink stains on top of the pages and the cover is bent.

  SOMETIMES THE ONE WHO LOVES YOU IS THE ONE WHO HURTS YOU THE MOST Lily hasn't always had it easy, but that's never stopped her from working hard for the life she wants. She's come a long way from the small town in Maine where she grew up - she graduated from college, moved to Boston, and started her own business. So when she feels a spark with a gorgeous neurosurgeon named Ryle Kincaid, everything in Lily's life suddenly seems almost too good to be true.  Ryle is assertive, stubborn, and maybe even a little arrogant. He's also sensitive, brilliant, and has a total soft spot for Lily, but Ryle's complete aversion to relationships is disturbing.  As questions about her new relationship overwhelm her, so do thoughts of Atlas Corrigan - her first love and a link to the past she left behind. He was her kindred spirit, her protector. When Atlas suddenly reappears, everything Lily has built with Ryle is threatened.  With this bold and deeply personal novel, Colleen Hoover delivers a heart-wrenching story that breaks exciting new ground for her as a writer. It Ends With Us is an unforgettable tale of love that comes at the ultimate price.This book contains graphic scenes and very sensitive subject matter.   Read more  ","['1.0 out of 5 stars', '1.0 out of 5 stars', '1.0 out of 5 stars', '1.0 out of 5 stars', '5.0 out of 5 stars', '1.0 out of 5 stars', '5.0 out of 5 stars', '5.0 out of 5 stars']","['\nSame cover, different book.\n', '\nI DIDNT GET THE RIGHT BOOK!!!\n', '\nDEFECTIVE\n', '\nNot even the same book!\n', '\nA Real Page Tuner\n', '\nPoor writing; juvenile\n', '\nHeart wrenching\n', '\nEmotional and Personal\n']","['\n\n  The book has the same exact covers but has a different story inside.

It’s such a deep book and just like the main character it makes you feel different waves of emotions. I cried several times throughout the book which is the telling of a great author.

The spoilers pertain mostly to the set up of the story, and don't give away any major plot points, but I know some people prefer to go in totally blind!This is a super personal story for the author, and I'm sure for many readers. It's touching and emotional in every way.  I don't know that I would go so far as to say it is unlike anything Colleen has written before, but it has the uniqueness that pervades all of her books, while still following a similar journey of finding your way in life in your early 20's.[start spoiler]Naked truth: I didn’t love part one of this book. It was slow building and very focused on Lily’s past rather than immersing me in the current story. I get why – it’s very important context for part two, but I still didn’t love it. Part of what I loved about November 9 (my favourite CoHo book), was how quickly the reader is immersed in and invested in the story – because the characters live a whole year apart, and it makes the time actually spent together so much more dramatic and interesting. The set up with the diary entries isn’t my favourite style of writing, and so, I thought this book would end up being around 4 stars for me.Then I got to part two. The story shifts pretty dramatically. The chapters are shorter and much more plot driven. Everything is more emotional, and it felt like everything I love about Colleen Hoover’s writing. It was heart wrenching and beautiful and so compelling I couldn’t stop until I was done. I loved every second of part two, even when it was tearing my heart into two parts. All the stars for part two. I think that evens out to 5 stars in general for the book.This was a painful story, but one that I highly recommend. If you’ve loved Colleen in the past, just know that the first half is a little slow building, but please please please keep reading. It is so worth it. You’ll be a different person by the end, I promise. If you’ve never read Colleen or had no interest in her previously, read It Ends With Us even if you read nothing else by this author. I have a feeling this book will hit a lot of people very hard, and while I have no personal experience with the subject matter, I was loudly sobbing by the epilogue. I was so invested in this story and ALL of the characters. The last chapter was a punch in the gut in the best way, leaving me loving the overall story completely.(end spoiler)Review immediately upon finishing: *sobs audibly in the corner*I just need a minute...or a couple days.

  The best-selling investing ""bible"" offers new information, new insights, and new perspectives  The Little Book of Common Sense Investing is the classic guide to getting smart about the market. Legendary mutual fund  pioneer John C. Bogle reveals his key to getting more out of investing: low-cost index funds. Bogle describes the simplest and most effective investment strategy for building wealth over the long term: buy and hold, at very low cost, a mutual fund that tracks a broad stock market Index such as the S&P 500. While the stock market has tumbled and then soared since the first edition of Little Book of Common Sense was published in April 2007, Bogle’s investment principles have endured and served investors well.  This tenth anniversary edition includes updated data and new information but maintains the same long-term perspective as in its predecessor.  Bogle has also added two new chapters designed to provide further guidance to investors:  one on asset allocation, the other on retirement investing. A portfolio focused on index funds is the only investment that effectively guarantees your fair share of stock market returns. This strategy is favored by Warren Buffett, who said this about Bogle: “If a statue is ever erected to honor the person who has done the most for American investors, the hands-down choice should be Jack Bogle. For decades, Jack has urged investors to invest in ultra-low-cost index funds. . . . Today, however, he has the satisfaction of knowing that he helped millions of investors realize far better returns on their savings than they otherwise would have earned. He is a hero to them and to me.” Bogle shows you how to make index investing work for you and help you achieve your financial goals, and finds support from some of the world's best financial minds: not only Warren Buffett, but Benjamin Graham, Paul Samuelson, Burton Malkiel, Yale’s David Swensen, Cliff Asness of AQR, and many others. This new edition of The Little Book of Common Sense Investing offers you the same solid strategy as its predecessor for building your financial future.  Build a broadly diversified, low-cost portfolio without the risks of individual stocks, manager selection, or sector rotation. Forget the fads and marketing hype, and focus on what works in the real world. Understand that stock returns are generated by three sources (dividend yield, earnings growth, and change in market valuation) in order to establish rational expectations for stock returns over the coming decade. Recognize that in the long run, business reality  trumps market expectations. Learn how to harness the magic of compounding returns while avoiding the tyranny of compounding costs.  While index investing allows you to sit back and let the market do the work for you, too many investors trade frantically, turning a winner’s game into a loser’s game. The Little Book of Common Sense Investing is a solid guidebook to your financial future.

  New York Times BestsellerThe new must-read epic from master storyteller Ken Follett: more than a thriller, it’s an action-packed, globe-spanning drama set in the present day.   “A compelling story, and only too realistic.” —Lawrence H. Summers, former U.S. Treasury Secretary “Every catastrophe begins with a little problem that doesn’t get fixed.” So says Pauline Green, president of the United States, in Follett’s nerve-racking drama of international tension.   A shrinking oasis in the Sahara Desert; a stolen US Army drone; an uninhabited Japanese island; and one country’s secret stash of deadly chemical poisons: all these play roles in a relentlessly escalating crisis.   Struggling to prevent the outbreak of world war are a young woman intelligence officer; a spy working undercover with jihadists; a brilliant Chinese spymaster; and Pauline herself, beleaguered by a populist rival for the next president election. Never is an extraordinary novel, full of heroines and villains, false prophets and elite warriors, jaded politicians and opportunistic revolutionaries. It brims with cautionary wisdom for our times, and delivers a visceral, heart-pounding read that transports readers to the brink of the unimaginable.

  If you see her, then you're dead...All Rob wanted to do was fit in at his new school after being torn from London so his parents could fix their marriage. But when Rob's journalist father dragged him along to investigate the legend of the Witchopper for the local paper, her curse became their reality.She was priestess to the pagan god of the wild wood, hanged by a rabid mob for her unspeakable crimes. Now, something far worse than the hell of high school is after Rob and his dad...In the vein of The Wickerman and Midsommar, Witchopper is an epic ordeal of a father and son relationship, where past sins echo in the present. Dan Soule delivers another of his terrifying Fright Nights, with a tale of love, lies and truth that will leave you sleeping with the light on. Praise for the author'Powerful and haunting' Adrian J.

His novel ‘Neolithica‘ was highly recommended to me by both Ross Jeffery and Joseph Sale, but, unfortunately, with how swamped I was at the time with review requests, I didn’t get to reading it. When ‘Witchopper‘ was announced, I was immediately intrigued. Look at that cover! That is a thing of beauty. Add in the premise of a horror-folklore story and I’m hooked. I’ll be diving into ‘Neolithica‘ here now shortly, as well.What I liked: While the premise is simple in it’s set up, trust me when I say, this book has layers. Meet Rob. Rob is a teen, struggling to fit in at school, moved away from his friend’s when his dad takes a new job. His dad is a journalist. Always up for following the story, going where it takes you. But Rob and his dad are struggling to keep some semblance of a relationship.This relationship dynamic adds a significant amount of tension and one thing I enjoyed was it grounded the story in the here and now, especially when the curse of the Witchopper begins to wrap its talons around the story itself.Soule crafted a fantastic take on this folklore story – truthfully, I don’t know if the Witchopper is a real being in history, I haven’t wanted to Google it all, simply because I don’t want to spoil any of the charm Soule conjured within this book.What I didn’t like: At first, I wasn’t too keen on the Father-Son dynamic, it felt a bit rushed at the beginning, but that worked itself out shortly thereafter. The book goes full slow burn at the start, which may be tougher for some folks who don’t do well with slower beginnings, but the payoff is worth it.Why you should buy it: Soule is a fantastic writer and ‘Witchopper‘ is a worthy addition to the growing list of folklore horror. While I haven’t seen the movie ‘Midsommer‘ which is listed on the synopsis as a comparison, I definitely see the influence of the seminal ‘The Wicker Man,’ which should be all you need to know to decide if you want to dive into this fantastic book!\n\n', '\n\n  This book is absolutely impossible to put down. Dan Soule sure knows how to capture us and keep us prisonner in his narrative so that a short night of sleep is ahead as well as constant anxiety if we dare to leave the book to go, say eat or wash the dishes.I had a ball reading this book in which it is the story of a journalist, trying to put his family back together and getting closer to his son, ends up following a story of the Witchopper, but ends up getting much more than he previously thought he would have to deal with, putting the very life of his son in danger in the process.If you have read previous books by Dan Soule, you will find common themes and an obsession for you reader to finish his book in one sitting. Trust me, there is no other way of doing it.\n\n', '\n\n  Dan Soule is pure gold. This is an amazing trip in so many ways.

  From New York Times Bestselling authors Vi Keeland and Penelope Ward comes a new, sexy standalone novel.It all started with a bet.When my young son inherited half of his great grandfather’s historic inn, I decided to move us both to the place where I grew up.Notice I said half of the Inn.  The other half now belonged to Levi Miller, the famous quarterback who had other ideas about what we should do with the property.We won’t mention that I accidentally injured him during our first meeting, causing him to get eight stitches.You could say we got off on the wrong foot.We bickered a lot as we both moved into the property while we figured things out.He wanted to unload the rundown place which, admittedly, needed a lot of work.I wanted to restore The Palm Inn to its original beauty and re-open it as a bed and breakfast.We couldn’t agree on anything.  So Levi made me a proposal.  One he thought I would surely lose.  If I could sell out the place by the time he had to leave for training at the end of summer, he would back off and let me run it.But in the weeks that followed, we got more than we bargained for while we were living under the same roof.Levi and I got closer, and before I knew it, my nightly fantasies about the brawny Adonis became a reality. Not to mention, he was so great with my son.We were in over our heads in more ways than one.Because not only was he the last man on Earth I should be falling for because of our deal, but Levi was also my ex’s older brother.And now the inn was the least of my problems.

I hated the main character so much I cannot even remember her name! I am searching for the character that was the show stopper and there isn’t one. I had to go back i to the book to get her name, Presley! Not sure how well played this one was. Alex the son was okay. Tanner is the ex, but not really cause he never married Presley and he was a drunk who decided to come back and “claim” what wasn’t his to begin with…leaving his brother Levi who had fallen for Presley in a quandary. That quandary was mostly Presley whining about “not telling anyone, or getting caught, or hurting her son” to the exclusion of all the others. And it was so painful watching her waffle between the two brothers…Seriously, if I were Levi I would have left too. So Levi leaves, as the right thing to do to go back to his NFL career and try to let Presley and Tanner have a shot, at what I am still not sure…Tanner was a serial cheater, drunk, gambler, absent dad and came back entitled as all get out. Him cheating again, surprise was one of the highlights. Fern, the old lady living in the Inn with them not sure what her role was. I am so sad that this whole thing was as confusing as my review. Seriously these writers rock! What happened. 3 stars is pretty generous for this story that had so much potential.\n\n', '\n\n  This  story  moved fast and made a fantastic read. The  secrets  and  strong  family ties  are  a few events in this book that  made it a very awesome must read.

I can feel his eyes on me over the breakfast table, and my heart pumps so hard when I hear him pull in the driveway after work.I have to stop this. It can't happen.My sister once told me there are no good men, and if you find one, he's probably unavailable.Only Pike Lawson isn't the unavailable one.I am.PIKEI took her in, because I thought I was helping.She'd cook a few meals and clean up a little.

I can't touch her, and I shouldn't want to.The more I find my path crossing hers, though, the more she's becoming a part of me.But we're not free to give into this.

While parts of this book are definitely cute the taboo tone the blurb and text was promising was not much of a success.The angst and longing promise because the heroine was pining after her boyfriend’s dad does not land well. This book is a conventional romance with a a lead couple with a large age difference. In that light it does well enough but it isn’t why I picked up the book.The heroine, Jordan, was a good character. She is young so her pride (read stubbornness) and her constant doubting of her self worth were realistic. A bit much if you’re older but nothing unreal. She read a little older than her age but I guess that was the point - she was a old soul in a young body. It made the romance between her and the hero, Pike, all the more believable.The boyfriend on the other hand was real non-entity. He is objectively a jerk but he hardly appears in the story and gets no POV. This hurt the story as I really didn’t care that Jordan was thinking of his dad or that she was afraid of cheating. Pike’s angst about lusting after his son’s girlfriend was a little more believable, but again, without knowing the son it didn’t really matter to the emotional core of the story. I just wanted the leads to get together.The story is definitely more of a slow-burn romance which takes it time. For being this sexy book, there is actually no sex in the first half. Once the couple gets together they go at it but the relationship part of the book is actually pretty short. They spend more time mooning after each other which can get a bit dull to read. It would have been nice to see more steam - or perhaps shorten the book by 10% or so.I do give the book credit for making Jordan more aggressive than typical heroines - she knew what she wanted. Good for her.In the end, I am giving this an average rating of 2 as it was ok. It wasn’t what I was promised. I will say that if expectations are adjusted this will likely be enjoyable for people. The writing is nice enough and parts of the book are pretty cute and sexy\n\n', '\n\n  It hurts me to write this review. I love Penelope’s writing soooo much, and I was so sad I didn’t love this book more 😔. This is still a decent book, my issues with it are spoilers, so you’ll have to read on my blog if you want my juicy thoughts…This book explores an age gap theme with an interesting twist in my opinion. Jordan and her boyfriend Cole have lost their apartment and need a place to stay while they regroup and save up money. Cole’s father Pike offers them to stay with him in exchange for chores around the house to try helping them out. Even though the relationship between Pike and Cole has been struggling and estranged for the past few years and the beginning is kinda super awkward for everyone, this seems like the best solution. The kids can save money and Pike can work on his relationship with his son.Only when Pike and Jordan see how much disdain Cole has for his father, they see him spending less and less time at home. Which means Jordan is picking up the slack with everything to cover both of them. Which also means she ends up spending more time with Pike than Cole is… also spending more time with Pike THAN Cole since they never seem able to find him…This book is interesting with a few different twists that come up along the way. Read on my blog the issues I have with specifics that include spoilers. It’s still a decent read with some suspense, hot scenes, and a lot of tension building constantly throughout the book until things explode everywhere. Even though o didn’t love it as much as I usually do a Penelope book, I still couldn’t put it down and still do recommend giving it a shot cause you might love it more than I did!\n\n', ""\n\n  I definitely went in with the wrong expectations.I wanted something quick and dirty (more erotica-esque but still has substance) and this was nothing of the sort. It was painfully slow. Like, I'm all for slow burn romances but we really don't light a match until the 50% mark. It didn't read like a forbidden romance or have that delicious tension. It just made the whole book drag; the exposition is far too long.Jordan was a little all over the place; during the sexy times she would become this whole other person that just seemed so out of character. Easy could have cut out 100 pages and still got the same story across.\n\n""]"

  COVID-19 and the Global Predators is much more than an analysis of the current exploitation of humanity under cover of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. It discloses for the first time the actual blueprint and master plan that that was ten years in the making by global predators before the pandemic: a plan to reorganize the world in the name of public health. Billionaires, government agencies, giant funds, and major industries collaborated years ahead of time to lay the groundwork for what would become Operation Warp Speed and the Great Reset in 2020.  All this is disclosed, individuals and groups are named, and their plans for the future are documented. The book concludes with chapters on what America and the world must do in the coming weeks and months to save humanity's freedoms. Many top medical and public health experts treating and examining COVID 19 agree this is the most comprehensive book about who and what is behind the draconian measures that are crushing individual freedoms and many of the societies and economies of the Western World including the United States, Canada, Great Britain, and Australia.Three of these medical doctors have confirmed this in their introductions to the book: physicians Peter McCullough MD MPH, Vladimir ""Zev"" Zelenko MD and Elizabeth Lee Vliet MD. They are echoed by endorsements from Robert F Kennedy Jr. and Paul Alexander PhD. This book thoroughly documents solid answers to these tragic questions about the global predators who are reaping enormous benefits from COVID-19 suffering including wealth, power and the destruction of America as an opposition to globalism. Who are the ""they""-these Global Predators? What are their motives and their plans for us?How can we defend against them? Why did they:■  Plan Warp Speed for a SARS-CoV pandemic years before it came?■  Distribute mRNA and DNA vaccines that killed lab animals and now humans?■  Collaborate with the Chinese making pandemic viruses & bioweapons?■  Hide the origin of SARS-CoV-2 in the Wuhan Institute?■  Let China spread the virus around the world on passenger planes?■  Give so much power to Dr. Anthony Fauci?Why do they continue to:■  Prohibit cheap, available, safe and eﬀective COVID-19 treatments?■  Impose draconian closures on our society and economy?■  Disproportionately harm or destroy small businesses and churches?■  Make us wear masks and distance ourselves from each other?■  Exaggerate the death rate from COVID-19 to frighten us?■  Hide the high and growing vaccine death rate from all of us?■  Make experimental ""vaccines"" that turn our bodies against ourselves?Dr. Breggin is a physician with 70+ scientiﬁc articles and 20+ medical texts and popular books. Heis among the world's most experienced medical experts in landmark legal cases in psychiatry andneurosurgery, and now in COVID-19. The Breggins' bestsellers include Talking Back to Prozac andToxic Psychiatry. Their research led the United States to cancel the deadly Chinese collaboration.Breggin is an intrepid scholar and is assiduous and methodological as he assembles all the pieces to the puzzle. His research, carried out with his wife Ginger, is impeccable, and his incisive approach sears the neck of those whose aim it is to wield power, control, and instill fear among the world's wealthiest nations.

And read it carefully!  It is not an easy read, but it is an essential read.  I say essential because before anything in this chaotic, fearful world can improve, the public needs to understand the WHY of what is taking place, who are the players, both major and minor, and what is their motivation.  Once this is understood,  much of the confusion about what is happening throughout the world will fall away and things will become clearer.Peter Breggin, M.D. and Ginger Breggin, in this thoroughly researched book, ""connect the dots"" between the globalist billionaires,  the one per cent of the total population who, in collaboration with the Communist Party of China, released SARS-COV-2 on the world to purposely remake society, economically, politically, socially  and indeed in every other way,  as per Klaus Schwab and the Great Reset.  This is all in order to further their agenda of power and profit at the expense of the rest of humanity.The authors have cited multiple documents providing evidence that the pandemic was preplanned by the global ""elites"" and the CCP to kick start this plan and gain unprecedented power over the global population, all the while amassing further billions for themselves.  Overwhelming evidence is presented that U. S. laboratories were indeed collaborating with ones in China, primarily the one in Wuhan, performing gain of function research.  This was all done under the auspices of the mainstream media darling and science ""icon"", Dr. Anthony Fauci.Dr. Breggin is eminently qualified to write on the subject of pharmaceutical companies,  their research methods,  marketing strategies and their incestuous relationships with federal health agencies, including the FDA and CDC, and how politics intertwine with both.  He is a former teaching fellow at Harvard Medical School and has published dozens of scientific articles and more than twenty books on the subject of psycho pharmaceuticals.  He has served as a medical expert in both civil and criminal trials involving psychiatric drugs, as well as product liability lawsuits against drug manufacturers.  To say he is well versed in the ways of pharmaceutical companies is an understatement.In this book, the Breggins also present evidence of how early mortality predictions were grossly overestimated and how scare tactics,  euphemistically renamed ""fear appeals"" have driven government agendas in order to obtain compliance vis- a- vis lockdowns, restrictions on assembly, travel, vaccines, etc. around the globe.  They also document how effective, inexpensive treatments have been purposely made unavailable to so many COVID-19 patients, resulting in untold numbers of unnecessary deaths.The authors point out the loss of fundamental freedoms suffered in all western democracies,  including the United States, all to the benefit of the CCP and the globalist billionaires.This book compiles, in an orderly, precise manner, the disparate pieces of information that are actually in the public domain, that the reader needs to actually make sense of what at times seems so incomprehensible.  These pieces of information will never be put together by any mainstream media outlet, as both mainstream media and the tech giants are complicit actors in this scheme toward total globalization and totalitarianism.  When all of these pieces of information are assembled logically, the reader can make sense of why SARS-COV-2 was unleashed on the world and the ultimate objective of those who contrived this crime against humanity.  It should serve as a wake up call to citizens of every country to stand up to this nefarious authoritarian, top down power grab.  The globalist one per centers and the Chinese Communist Party have no morals, ethics or loyalties to anything other than power and profit.  If we do not stand up, once freedom is lost, it will be nearly impossible to regain.Peter Breggin comments that once the CCP gains the dominance it seeks, it will then devour the globalist billionaires who aided and abetted its rise to global preeminence.  This is akin to the snake that ultimately devours its own tail, and history abounds with examples to support this assertion.  Be that as it may, it is no comfort to WE THE PEOPLE to know that we are to be devoured in the process, reduced to serfs, existing only to do the bidding of global power, bereft of our God given rights and freedoms.Read this book, absorb its facts and ponder the evidence presented.  You will then be in a much better position to understand both how you are being manipulated and the urgent need stand up to the tyrants who are systematically taking away our freedoms.\n\n', ""\n\n  Great, exhaustively researched book.  Will change your entire outlook on what's really going on in the world.Get the hardcover....Kindle sucks.\n\n"", '\n\n  The authors give 100% proof of the title.

He was the perfect boyfriend, but on the day he was going to propose, she broke his heart. A year later he married his travel agent, while Sophie has been mortifyingly single ever since. Now Thomas is back in her life because Sophie has unexpectedly inherited his aunt Connie's house on Scribbly Gum Island—home of the famously unsolved Munro Baby mystery.Sophie moves onto the island and begins a new life as part of an unconventional family, where it seems everyone has a secret. Grace, a beautiful young mother, is feverishly planning a shocking escape from her perfect life. Margie, a frumpy housewife, has made a pact with a stranger, while dreamy Aunt Rose wonders if maybe it's about time she started making her own decisions.As Sophie's life becomes increasingly complicated, she discovers that sometimes you have to stop waiting around—and come up with your own fairy-tale ending.

  “If you liked Chaos, you’ll love Complexity. Waldrop creates the most exciting intellectual adventure story of the year” (The Washington Post).   In a rarified world of scientific research, a revolution has been brewing. Its activists are not anarchists, but rather Nobel Laureates in physics and economics and pony-tailed graduates, mathematicians, and computer scientists from all over the world. They have formed an iconoclastic think-tank and their radical idea is to create a new science: complexity. They want to know how a primordial soup of simple molecules managed to turn itself into the first living cell—and what the origin of life some four billion years ago can tell us about the process of technological innovation today.   This book is their story—the story of how they have tried to forge what they like to call the science of the twenty-first century.   “Lucidly shows physicists, biologists, computer scientists and economists swapping metaphors and reveling in the sense that epochal discoveries are just around the corner . . . [Waldrop] has a special talent for relaying the exhilaration of moments of intellectual insight.” —The New York Times Book Review    “Where I enjoyed the book was when it dove into the actual question of complexity, talking about complex systems in economics, biology, genetics, computer modeling, and so on. Snippets of rare beauty here and there almost took your breath away.” —Medium   “[Waldrop] provides a good grounding of what may indeed be the first flowering of a new science.” —Publishers Weekly     Read more  ","['5.0 out of 5 stars', '3.0 out of 5 stars', '5.0 out of 5 stars', '4.0 out of 5 stars', '5.0 out of 5 stars']","['\nGood quality by company\n', '\nThree Stars\n', '\nWonderful reading for every science enthusiast!\n', '\nThe Making of the Santa Fe Institute\n', '\nThinkers from the Land of Enchantment.\n']","['\n\n  My book came on time. It is in good condition.\n\n', '\n\n  Dated\n\n', '\n\n  The cover of the book says "" If you liked Chaos, you will love complexity"". I just finished reading the book, that validated the claim. While Chaos is written as story of discovery of a new science, Complexity excels as a saga of men who ventured into previously unchartered domains addressing for the first time issues like:What is life? What is driving force that caused cells to appear from a primordal soup of all elements, when the probability of so happening is infinitesimal? What causes evolution? Do nice guys finish last? What makes evolution, coevolution, adaptation, extinction work? Why do we organize ourselves into families, cultures, nations?Why do stock markets crash, boom? What controls the emergence of economies? Why can USSR go from one of strongest nations/economies to the state of divided helplessness in less than a few years?Why are we here? What is life? Artificial Life? Are we still evolving? What is the cause of increasing complexity?On mundane level: What is non-linearity? What is Chaos? If this science is all that important, why did we wait this long for recognizing it?What are the paradigms in which sociology and physics settle into same patterns? How neural networks were born, brought up and mastered?This novel/book is as much about these questions as it is about the scientists who engaged in unravelling many of these mysteries. It speaks about their failures and successes, their approach, ethic and driving force, their fears, fights and friendships. For most part it reads like a thriller, and by the time you are done, you find yourself searching for another book on Chaos, complexity, life at the edge of chaos, genetic algorithms, artificial intelligence. After just 358 pages, your imagination and knowledge of science leaps from Newton\'s linear models to the twentyfirst century stuff.\n\n', '\n\n  I bought this book back in 1994, when it was released as a paperback in the UK. I liked it tremendously, and although I let a dozen friends or so borrow it from me to read, I was keeping its track very meticulously in order to get it back every time. Complexity is one of those books that easily gets lost if you are not careful, you know.In short, the book is a chronicle of at the time seemingly unrelated ideas that finally led to forming of the Santa Fe Institute in 1984, and the people who created them: the economist Brian Arthur and his lock-in theory of ""increasing returns"" (better known to engineers as ""positive feedback""); Stuart Kaufmann and his ""autocatalytic"" models for evolving biological systems; John Holland and his genetic algorithms and genetic programming; Christopher Langton and his ""artificial life""; Doyne Farmer with all his experience with chaos theory; and of course the ""founding fathers"" of the Santa Fe Institute: George Cowan, Kenneth Arrow, and two Nobel-prize winners, Murray Gell-Mann and Philip Anderson.With a PhD in Physics, MA in Journalism and over ten years of service as a senior science writer for one of the world\'s most prestigious science journals - Science - M. Mitchell Waldrop seems like a role-model science writer. Complexity is his second book, being predecessed by Man Made Minds, a survey of artificial intelligence. This book, however, bears much greater resemblance in style with James Gleick\'s bestseller Chaos than with his own previous work.Some ""historical distance"" allows us also a somewhat more critical view on the complexity theory itself. Contrary to the popular expectations of the time, complexity was since forced to follow the same path that chaos, fractals or catastrophe theory - to name a few - traveled before it, and admit that is not The Great Universal Theory of Everything. On the other hand, while the hype is gone, we have to admit that complexity - or ""nonlinear science"", if you want - is still very actively worked on.So is this book for you? Yes, if you want vivid explanation of one of the most important ideas that shaped the end of the 20th century, and colorful portraits of the people behind it. If nothing else, it will wet your mouth. If Complexity will succeed in winning your interest, you may want to proceed with other popular reading on this topic - almost everyone of the people mentioned before has himself published at least one book. For learning more hard science, however, you should reach for other science monographs and papers.\n\n', '\n\n  The recombinant DNA technology pioneers had their heyday at Asilomar; the Manhattan Project brought together some of the best minds in physics at a pivotal time of the century just passed; lately, tucked between the Jemez  Mountains and the Sangre de Cristo Mountains of northern New Mexico,  think-tankers at the Sante Fe Institute brought us the concept of order at  the brink of chaos.  The universe, and life as we know it, teeters close to  the edge of all-out disorder and boring, predictable superorganization and  ""super-stability"", and somehow has managed to stay always in  between.  Roll the tape of the evolution of the universe and life backward,  allow it to move forward, and see whether complexity is an intrinsic  property of the cosmos rather than happenstance.  Does Stuart Kauffman\'s  ""order for free"" tendency for self-organization operate in past  and future---or other---universes?This book is a good primer to the  concept of complexity as applied to economics, life, and the universe, and  is an engaging read.  I can imagine some biologists would tend to check out  Kauffman\'s book ""At home in the universe"" after reading  ""Complexity"".\n\n']"

A great read for Christmas time with the kids. Do note that in order for the lights at the back of the book to flash, you will need to have a light source available (almost as if it's solar-powered, but isn't). I thought the battery was already dead but when I brought it into a well-lit room they appeared. They do not appear in the dark.\n\n"", ""\n\n  Not as great of a story as the original Little Blue Truck but still fun for the kids with a nice holiday theme.

We read it over and over and he loves the Christmas lights on the last page.

But the problem is she had some sort of accident that gave her amnesia. So we're left wondering how exactly she got into the accident, who her current guardians are and WHY have they made it their/Scarlett's mission to destroy them.Book 1 of this series is such a perfect r set up for a series, hooks you on the characters and story and also leaves you desperate  to know the answers to all of your questions.Now let's talk about these horsemen!Holy hell they are spicy.West is downright psychopathic (well they all are) but west is just so hard around the edges. He is so hurt that the woman he's been in love with since he was 16 doesn't remember him. He's clearly trying to protect himself by keeping her at a distance.Pres - He's your cinnamon roll of the group. Sure, he's got his kinks (voyeurism) but the second Scar shows real emotions, he's putty in her hands!!Drake and Francis are the ones I'm still struggling to get a read on. They're possessive, domineering, control freaks who are kinky as f*k. But we haven't managed to Crack their shells yet.And its still hard to really see who Scar is.

This story has very little sunshine and no rainbows, if there were flowers, they would be beautifully black. But not to worry, you are also in for the most amazing treat, the storytelling and writing talents of this fantastic author! Pay attention to the warnings, this story is about two tasks, each determined for revenge and to destroy the other.

  “Dr. Jason Fung has done it again. In easy to follow, simple steps and rules, Dr. Fung gives you the tools to rid yourself of diabetes forever. Get this book!”—Dr. Steven R. Gundry, author of The Plant ParadoxThe must-have guide to reversing and preventing type 2 diabetes through intermittent fasting and a low-carb, high-fat diet—from Dr. Jason Fung, internationally best selling author of The Obesity Code.Today, most doctors, dietitians, and even diabetes specialists consider type 2 diabetes to be a chronic and progressive disease—a life sentence with no possibility of parole. But the truth, as Dr. Fung reveals in this paradigm-shifting book, is that type 2 diabetes is reversible. Writing with clear, persuasive language, he explains why conventional treatments that rely on insulin or other blood-glucose-lowering drugs can actually exacerbate the problem, leading to significant weight gain and even heart disease. The only way to treat type 2 diabetes effectively, he argues, is proper dieting and intermittent fasting—not medication.

This book completely reversed my thinking on diabetes. His book is well-researched with pages of references at the back of the book.  There is a lot on why diabetes is at epidemic proportions in North America and other countries around the world.  He also explains why it is such a serious disease and what it does to our body.

I would give this book 10 stars if it was allowed.  Highly, highly recommend it.\n\n', '\n\n  Finally a book on Diabetes that is truthful. Stopped taking 2 Metformin 500mg and another 2 pills for Diabetes over a month now. No more pills for me, dropped A1C from 7.4 to 5.4 in 1 week, then gradually went up to and holding at 6.

The book is very interesting and dives into great detail about how insulin resistance develops and why more and more people are becoming diabetic these days.

And if you’re planning on enjoying a cup of Earl Grey with this quality e-book, please remember: it’s tea first, milk second. Finally, don’t be afraid to laugh thunderously when reading this novel.

  From USA Today Bestselling author Adriana Locke comes a workplace romance between a grumpy, alpha architect and his new client—who just so happens to have the blueprint to bring him to his knees. Romance is not in Wade Mason’s portfolio.This is tragic. It’s unfair that a man so maddeningly gorgeous—an architect with a deliciously squarish jaw, adorably dimpled chin, and the hottest black glasses that straddle the line between professional and provocative—rebukes all things love. I knew this well before I walked into his office. The man is a conundrum—a complicated, steel wall of a puzzle. On the one hand, he brushes against me in the conference room with a broodiness that sets me on fire. He demands in-person meetings about the house we are working on together. I catch him watching me out of the corner of his eye with a look that’s anything but platonic. But any talk of hookups, love, or relationships—even in general? Completely off the table. I’m determined to peel back his layers until I get to the bottom of the mysterious businessman. But my plan is foiled by a surprise that leaves both of us reeling. Neither of us sees it coming, but it changes everything … forever.

He's been the mysterious one, the broody, sometimes downright rude, grumpy brother who you really didn't know a whole lot about, which made me think there was a WHOLE LOT to uncover where he was concerned. And boy, IS THERE!!!!Adriana Locke saved the BEST for last, in my humble opinion, as far as the Mason's are concerned! Wade and Dara, who is the absolutely PERFECT foil for him, are what slow burn romances SHOULD be! I LOVED everything about this one! It gave me EVERY SINGLE FEEL that an AMAZING Adriana Locke book delivers (X 1000!!!) I would go so far as to say that Resolution is in my TOP 3 BOOKS from this author, that's how much I loved it! I even loved the parts that ripped out my heart and made me cry huge fat UGLY CRY tears, because it all just made the end that much more sweet! It was sooooooo worth every one of them!Ms. Locke has delivered what feels like her soul in a book and I can't recommend this one highly or strongly enough! YOU TRULY DO NOT WANT TO MISS THIS ONE!!!!\n\n"", ""\n\n  Resolution is so much more than I could have even hoped for!  Wade has definitely met his match with Dara, their chemistry is undeniable 🔥  There is so much heart packed into this book, and the interactions between everyone keeps you wanting more!The Mason's (as well as Landry & Gibson families) are all amazing 💜 The way Adriana Locke interconnects them and keeps true to the individual characters makes you want to read them over and over again!\n\n"", ""\n\n  I'm a huge fan of Adriana's writing and the families she writes about. That being said this was one of my absolute favorite books of hers. It was incredibly well done and the emotions were so incredibly real!\n\n"", '\n\n  I had been waiting for Wade story for months now.  I love Wade’s personality.  A wizard, genius and love his witty direct comments.  I might start binge the rest of the Landry stories.\n\n', '\n\n  Finally ! So excited to finally get Wades book. It was worth the wait!! Wade was so uptight. Dara had her sights set on him since the beginning.\n\n', ""\n\n  The title of this book is just right. From being the last book of a series, you want to see things resolved to the grumpy cat of a man named Wade Mason. Who is one ornery ball of irritation and tension or so it seems. He's battling something inside himself and is completely unwilling to let it out. Until he meets Dara Alden, whose bold cheerfulness starts unravelling him by poking holes in tough exterior from the moment they meet.Wade is definitely swoony once you get past his thorny exterior but to me, Dara is the star of this book. I love that she's instantly attracted to him but it's not what motivates her. She's intuitive enough to understand his limitations and instead thoughtfully push Wade's boundaries even when she had no plans to be with him. She wants him to see past himself to the amazing person underneath. Her sunshiny demeanor pulls you into their dynamic.These two characters are so much more than meets the eye and their luggage is slowly unpacked as their chemistry and attraction continuously pulls them together. They're so deep in denial and excellent banter until they get down to their true selves and find they're more similar than they thought.I am so sad to see the end of the Mason brothers but loved all the glimpses of Holt, Coy, Oliver and Boone and their better halves that we got in this book. It's like they've all pulled together to make sure Wade, the most emotionally contained and stubborn of them all gets his HEA. Even good ol' dad makes a significant impact in this one instead of my favourite book mom ever, Siggy Mason. Which leads me to think...this IS called Mason FAMILY series. I would love to see what is going to happen with Siggy and her husband. Their story feels...unfinished.Resolution is a poignant love story with humorous and deeply loving moments. Wade and Dara's story is so worth the read. They will pull on your heartstrings and have you shipping them from the get-go. The Mason Family series is definitely binge-worthy holiday reading. One-click Resolution today!\n\n"", ""\n\n  I've been waiting for Wade's story ... he's been so mysterious throughout the whole series. He tries to avoid everyone, except for family. I just love his niece, Rosie and how she's just so taken with him. It makes me laugh-out-loud how over the top she is about him ... grabbing onto his legs and not letting him go ... CUTE! I love how Dara is so sarcastic and doesn't let Wade get away with anything. Then there's the chemistry between Wade and Dara ... it's so off the charts that even Wade can't ignore it. This has been a great series and I'm presuming this is the last book as all the brothers have had a book. I'm sorry it's over because I have really enjoyed this series. The banter between the brothers is so realistic and the situations are everyday occurrences.I received an early copy courtesy of the author in exchange for a honest review.\n\n"", ""\n\n  Resolution is the fifth book in the Mason Family, and the one I have been waiting for. This is a slow burning, emotional, well written, tension filled, romantic read.  Wade is the last man to fall in love, he is grumpy, and holds his cards close to his chest, but the moment the little tornado comes into his life, nothing is the same.  Dana is so strong willed, and I liked her. I liked the back and forth banter between them, and talk about sexual tension.  I like that the Mason Family make an appearance too.I enjoyed this series, and I'm gonna miss this family so much.\n\n""]"

I think it has to do with the internal monologue of the main character. Our MC in this one was Vanessa, and I must say that I loved her dearly. Her thoughts and emotions and the inner workings of her mind just seemed so relatable and true to what someone would actually experience in those situations. I feel like I was really able to understand her character, and appreciate her even more for it. She was kind, and strong, and generous, and funny, but with a backbone that was rock solid.

Her mother's handwriting on the lined notepaper is so familiar, and the slight German accent Mali hears ticking through her words, so haunting.Mali reads the memories of her mother's Jewish childhood in 1930s Berlin, then her life in war-torn London.

  When Martin McKenna was growing up in Garryowen, Ireland, in the 1970s, he felt the whole world knew him as just that stupid boy.” Badly misunderstood by his family and teachers, Martin escaped from endless bullying by running away from home and eventually adoptingor being adopted bysix street dogs. Camping out in barns, escaping from farmers, and learning to fend for himself by caring for his new friends, Martin discovered a different kind of language, strict laws of behavior, and strange customs that defined the world of dogs. More importantly, his canine companions helped him understand the vital importance of family, courage, and self-respectand that he wasn’t stupid after all. Their lessons helped Martin make a name for himself as the Dog Man” in Australia, where he now lives and dispenses his hard-earned wisdom to dog owners who are sometimes baffled by what their four-legged friends are trying to tell them.An emotional and poignant story seasoned with plenty of Frank McCourtstyle humor, The Boy Who Talked to Dogs is an inspiration to anyone who’s ever been told he or she won’t amount to anything. It’s also a unique, fascinating look into canine behavior. In these pages, Martin shows how modern life has conditioned dogs to act around humans, in some ways helpful, but in other ways unnatural to their true instincts, and how he has benefited enormously from learning to talk dog.”   Read more  ","['5.0 out of 5 stars', '5.0 out of 5 stars', '4.0 out of 5 stars', '5.0 out of 5 stars']","['\nSurprising.\n', '\nGood summer book\n', '\nVery enlightening\n', '\nPage turner\n']","['\n\n  This is an amazing true story.

  From New York Times Bestselling Author, Penelope Douglas, comes the latest New Adult romance... ""We were perfect together. Until we met.""  Misha I can't help but smile at the lyrics in her letter. She misses me. In fifth grade, my teacher set us up with pen pals from a different school. Thinking I was a girl, with a name like Misha, the other teacher paired me up with her student, Ryen. My teacher, believing Ryen was a boy like me, agreed. It didn't take long for us to figure out the mistake. And in no time at all, we were arguing about everything. The best take-out pizza. Android vs. iPhone. Whether or not Eminem is the greatest rapper ever... And that was the start. For the next seven years, it was us. Her letters are always on black paper with silver writing. Sometimes there's one a week or three in a day, but I need them. She's the only one who keeps me on track, talks me down, and accepts everything I am.  We only had three rules. No social media, no phone numbers, no pictures. We had a good thing going. Why ruin it? Until I run across a photo of a girl online. Name's Ryen, loves Gallo's pizza, and worships her iPhone. What are the chances? F*ck it. I need to meet her. I just don't expect to hate what I find. Ryen He hasn't written in three months. Something's wrong. Did he die? Get arrested? Knowing Misha, neither would be a stretch. Without him around, I'm going crazy. I need to know someone is listening. It's my own fault. I should've gotten his phone number or picture or something. He could be gone forever. Or right under my nose, and I wouldn't even know it. *Punk 57 is a stand alone New Adult romance. It is suitable for ages 18+.

This was my very first read within the ""bully romance"" genre, and I wasn\'t sure how I would feel about it.  As someone who was bullied quite a lot growing up, I couldn\'t fathom the idea of falling for your tormentor.  But Punk 57 by Penelope Douglas changed that for me, and I finally understood.The past two days has been a back and forth between my and my sister, me texting her variations of ""WTF?!?"" several times as I read through this novel.  Misha - the tortured bad boy who doesn\'t care about fitting in, only about being himself.  Ryen - the closet geek and timid girl who hides behind a cruel facade and cares far too much about fitting in.  My heart broke and jumped into my throat on several occasions as I glared, teared up, laughed, and even bared my teeth once or twice at my Kindle.Misha and Ryen find solace and comfort in each other for 7 years whilst never meeting, only communicating via good old fashioned snail mail.  The way they torture and torment each other throughout the book stole my breath away, her trying to show off for her friends while he\'s trying with everything in his power to find the girl he knows and loves beneath the mask.It\'s heart breaking, thought provoking, gut wrenching, and raw.  Two people who would probably never associate under normal circumstances coming together and sifting through the lies to finally figure out who they are.Now I could go on for hours, but it would give the entire book away, and I really encourage you to read it.  But please, I am begging you - be kind to one another.  If someone is down, try to lift them back up.  You don\'t need to be cruel to gain attention - you simply need to be you.  Throughout this book, I kept thinking of a quote from a movie that I\'ve always loved, so I\'m going to leave you with it to mull over.""Why are you trying so hard to fit in when you were born to stand out?""  - Ian Wallace, What a Girl Wants\n\n', '\n\n  I loved everything about the is book. I’ve had it on my TBR for forever and finally dove in, I was not disappointed! Falling for someone solely based off of their words, having that one person you can tell all of your hopes,dreams and fears to, without judgement was a beautiful thing. Mesha and Ryen were perfectly imperfect, their ups and downs, their secrets and lies kept me hanging on their every word. Loved this book!\n\n', '\n\n  Angst, sexual tension on the precipice of exploding, and emotionally damaging pasts that lead to brooding teenagers… This book is the perfect blend of anguish and self discovery. I loved every single minute of it. It captured me from the start and didn’t let go even well after I finished.What starts out as a school pen pal mixup from unique names turns into a year long friendship through letters in the mail. These two have only ever communicated through written words, yet somehow created a bond that could never be broken… until one night it is broken. When Misha stops writing, Ryen is slowly losing it. Trying to adjust to a life without her letters is a difficult road, and no matter what happens with others in her life, she can never stop thinking of Misha. Misha has been scarred and has to work through his issues. He doesn’t have time to deal with Ryen, yet somehow keeps finding himself around her and it’s hard to stay away…Can these two figure everything out going on with themselves, each other, and the other factors all around them? Every time I thought I figured things out in the book, another twist came. I was on my toes the whole time, it’s one of the books I was up at 2am reading because I. Couldn’t. Put. It. Down. I need to own a copy of this book, it’s getting added to the TBBL.\n\n', ""\n\n  I read this in one sitting as I do most books that get heavy on my mind and heart because I don't like carrying the weight around if I procrastinate reading it.I didn't expect this book to be a hard read for me because of people raving how spicy it was bit but it was. Bullying tropes really get under my skin and I went in blind reading this so I didn't know that was gonna be the case. It took me until about 25% of the book to even start getting comfortable but after that the story flowed a little bit better for me.Though through the little sniffles I had and an almost mental break down reliving my own pain through Ryen, I appreciated how flawed she was and how she persevered through everything that happened and of course her beautiful relationship with Misha... the light of this book. He was flawed but also all sorts of wonderful.This book got me typing a review (which I seldom do) at 6am with no sleep says it all.This book was the good kind of pain and I loved it.\n\n"", '\n\n  ""We were perfect for each other. Until we met.""Sometimes you read a book blurb and the book doesn\'t live up to your expectations at all. Then there are those books that the blurb gives you just enough to get you interested and then the book is such more than you expected that you just let it completely consume you. Then when it ends your feelings are a big mumble jumbled mess and you wish you had savored it more. That is this book to a T. Don\'t be put off by it being high school because it is so much more!!\n\n', '\n\n  Punk 57 was my first PD read and it did not disappoint.Misha and Ryen have been pen pals since fifth grade and have never met, but when they do…“We were perfect together. Until we met”This book was the perfect enemies to love, bully romance. Once I started it, I couldn’t put it down.I’ve heard so many people say that PD’s books were next level spice and they weren’t wrong.I loved this story, I loved the characters and I loved the mystery.Misha and Ryen’s chemistry was INTENSE and I loved how their relationship started off so innocent through their letters but once they came face to face it was instant angst.I’ve now read many of Penelope Douglas’s book and I can truly say they are all incredible but this one hit different and will always have a special place in my heart.\n\n']"

It’s been a while since I’ve had a book do this and I loved it.The first half continually ramped up then it slowed down a little bit and picked up right until the end. I was trying to figure out how this book would lead into a second book because it kind of seemed like things were being tied up. Then there were multiple surprises and plays on emotions within the last few pages and you know book 2 is going to be a whole new adventure.We learn a decent amount about the female main character, River. I’m sure will delve a little bit more within the next book. Although the book was multiple points of view, we were only given glimpses of the men, enough to make you very curious.

Penelope constantly keeps you on edge with action, steam, and mystery. Her story telling was done phenomenally in this novel, everything was written with precision and the pace was absolutely perfect for this novel.————————————————————————-This is a novel I can’t say much about because I dont want to ruin it for others. I posted the other day stating that this novel was a “triangle” and I was definitely wrong. Its something alright, but a triangle it is not. The connections between the characters in this novel is like no other that I have ever read. Its an un-explainable relationship that grabs your heart and twists. Some of the events between characters was incredibly shocking; but hell, it was so so good. I was left with my mouth agape at multiple points during this novel. Just when I thought I was on a roll, I was thrown in a loop. The characters are so multi-dimensional and I loved, LOVED getting to know Tiernan, Jake, Noah, and Kaleb.————————————————————————-Also, if your looking for a read that will give you the perfect steam, this is it. I love steam in a novel, its one of my favourite parts of Romance and Penelope KILLED it.————————————————————————-This novel was hypnotic, intoxicating, and honestly Romantic. I highly recommend this novel. You wont regret it.————————————————————————-I would rate this novel a 5📖\n\n', '\n\n  I won’t say much in this review, since it is a book that should NOT be spoiled whatsoever! Like the synopsis hints at, it ends in a HEA. The synopsis makes sense after only a few chapters. We start realizing who has her, who wants her, and who is determined to keep her.Jake plays a larger part in the first half than he does in the end bit, but boy, does he heat up the pages from the very beginning. Although Noah too knows how to use his words, I was never a fan. HIs personality is too brotherly. Kaleb is the dark character we all love to read about. My heart broke and grew for him.They all have unique interactions with Tiernan that needed to happen. I wish I could say more, but I won’t. I think despite the topic the author introduces, she did it well and in a way that showed that it needed to happen before the end of the book. She didn’t hold back in this one and it definitely worked for her.Another 5 star read from Penelope Douglas!\n\n', '\n\n  I never knew what to expect with this novel. Penelope really out did her self with all of the twists and turns. I truly love her work! There is going to be a lot of controversy about all of the taboo content and I’m still not sure how I truly feel about everything in this novel. But that is also what made it such a good read. It makes you digger deeper and even after finishing the novel your left wondering about how you really feel about the whole work. I love that although this is 100% a steamy novel, there is so much more too it then anyone can image by just reading the back of the book! I can’t wait for Penelope’S next standalone!\n\n', '\n\n  This book is the first I’ve read by Penelope Douglas and so far it’s been a 10/10 read. I started reading it for the erotic behaviours between characters and stayed for the story line this book literally takes you and drags you into the story so much so it’s very hard to put the book down once you’ve started. Absolutely love it!\n\n', ""\n\n  I heard mixed reviews on this book so I was hesitant to read it, but I couldn't put it down.

Despite that I stuck with it, which I’m very glad for as this book pulled on all of my heart strings. Definitely recommend if you haven’t already read the book!!

  Is it ever too late to leave the friend zone?Hi, my name is Bree Camden, and I’m hopelessly in love with my best friend and star quarterback Nathan Donelson (as is half of America, judging by the tabloids and how much the guy dates). The first step is admitting, right? Except I can never admit it to him because he clearly doesn’t see me that way, and the last thing I want is for things to get weird between us.Nothing but good old-fashioned, no-touching-the-sexiest-man-alive, platonic friendship for us! Everything is exactly how I like it! Yes. Good. (I’m not crying, I’m just peeling an onion.)Our friendship is going swimmingly until I accidentally spill my beans to a reporter after too much tequila, and now the world seems to think Nathan and I belong together. Oh, and did I mention we have to date publicly for three weeks until after the Super Bowl because we signed a contract with...oops, forgot I can’t tell anyone about that!Bottom line is, now my best friend is smudging all the lines and acting very un-platonic, and I’m just trying to keep my body from bursting into flames every time he touches me. How am I going to make it through multiple weeks of fake dating Nathan without anything changing between us? Especially when it almost-sorta-kinda seems like he’s fighting for a completely different outcome?Send help.XO BreeThe Cheat Sheet is a closed-door, sizzling-with-chemistry, romantic comedy that will have you laughing and rooting for these lovable best friends from the first page!

The author gives you further hope there might be banging but still...no. Disappointing. The other characters in the book were more interesting than the main characters, who were oblivious and boring. Didn\'t know there was term for this ""closed-door"" type novel but good to know so I can avoid it.\n\n', '\n\n  This book was excellent. I don’t think it’s an exaggeration to say that I loved everything about it. I especially appreciated the obvious affection and chemistry between Bree and Nathan, as well as the dynamics added by the supporting characters.There were no explicit scenes in this book, but I don’t think it suffered in any way for this. The love and connection between Bree and Nathan was still palpable.I’m glad that I had the day off because I really didn’t want to put this book down. It drew me in and did exactly what Sarah Adams claims to want from her writing: it left me feeling happier than I felt before I started reading it.I hope this is the beginning of a series because I would love to see Nathan’s teammates get coupled off. They were so sweet and endearing.\n\n', ""\n\n  This book was equally hilarious and adorable. These two have been secretly in love with one another since they were in high school. Both of them are too scared to tell the other person for fear of being rejected and ruining their friendship.This book is not steamy. It's very PG rated but honestly the story makes up for whatever spice you're missing. I cried towards the end. The story moved me to literal tears.\n\n"", '\n\n  I love this book. The POVs of both characters are so hilarious and something that anyone can relate to. There were a lot of funny and romantic moments and the story just flowed seamlessly. Another 5 star book by Ms. Adams. I expect the next books about Lawrence, Derek and Jamal.\n\n', '\n\n  This was so cute! Its so funny and adorable! Just adorable!I love it! I’m in the fluffy heavens of cuteness. 😍Exactly what I was in the mood for! Love it! 😊I wouldn’t consider this as “adult romance”. It very light and fluffy romance. No sex scene but a lot of.. tension. But it’s PG. Which is ok. The cuteness of this book made it so worth it! 😊\n\n', '\n\n  I think this might be my favourite romance I’ve ever read. I was crying at the end because it honestly was so sweet and beautiful. This book made me feel HAPPY. It was hilarious at times and moving and my gosh the romance was so wholesome. I enjoyed every second. So well developed and I’m a sucker for the mutual pining. This book hit everything for me. It was perfect\n\n', '\n\n  Was looking for a light read and this was perfect!

However this was not as good as the first book. I still loved the characters, the other characters helped me finish the book . I  loved the exchange the letters and recommendations of books part , that we very romantic. Finlay and Nyfrayns relationship intensified and was quite steamy . The steamy sections were over done in my opinion. I did not have the notion to finish the book in one day like first one . I had to put the book down a few times because I got bored. I had to fight myself not to skip to the end because I was bored.  Finlay was amazing and she is destined to be by Nyfrain .  I was going to giv it 3 stars but the last 20 percent made up for it .\n\n', '\n\n  Found the first book tame? This is nothing compared to this one! Even more heat, even more passion, even more feels, and all this for us to cruelly wait until February for the next one!Again, this book is intended for adult audiences only, and not for the faint of heart! I thought I loved Nyfain after the first book. Well, I’m now irrevocably in bookish love with him, now. And Finley really is the Beauty of our own heart, even more so now.Another slam-dunk by K.F. Breene!\n\n', ""\n\n  Quite a good book. Believable romance. Love the shifter twist under a curse to the Betty and the Beast plot. Also love that our girl has believable power scale happening.Sometimes it's hard to tell if this is a post-apocalyptic modern fantasy or alternative world setting and I don't like the internet culture words that break the 4th wall a mite but still, some of KF Breene's best writing with a hella hook for the next one.\n\n"", '\n\n  This book was amazing! So much fire and spice! I have never had a book affect me like a ruin of roses and a throne of ruin. It woke something in me up. I only finished ator sunday and just reread AROR and am currently rereading ATOR. I love hadriel. Every time hes on page i cant help but laugh. Finley is officially one of my all time favourite heroines. This series is now one of my all time favourites. I imagine there are many rereads in my future! Febuary seems way to far away to continue this epic story! Definitely 5 stars, id give it more if i could.\n\n', '\n\n  What a wild ride, love K F Breene’s writing style. Tongue in cheek sass and bad ass strong women who save the day. Not to mention hot as hell sex scenes, holy sizzle. Fans self. This is a great read!!\n\n', '\n\n  Awesome characters - check!Fantastic humour - check!Intriguing story plot - check!Steamy and sexy - 🔥check!🔥Dying for the next book - check! check! check!\n\n', '\n\n  A deliciously naughty book that still brings an excellent story and character development\n\n', ""\n\n  This book was fantastic.
