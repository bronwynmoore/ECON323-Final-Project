  Two thousand years ago, Jesus Christ met face-to-face with people just like you. Broken, imperfect, sometimes fearful and without hope. The Day I Met Jesus is a beautifully crafted narrative that chronicles the remarkable encounters of five women in the Gospels who were desperate to find wholeness, security, and purpose. Like all of us, these women struggled with the regrets of their pasts, the stresses of their presents, and the worries of their tomorrows.Join Frank Viola and Mary DeMuth on a fascinating journey back in time as they retell the dramatic accounts of five women who met Jesus. Each narrative is told from each woman's unique perspective, yet tightly grounded in the Gospel accounts and faithful to first-century history. Elegantly written and profoundly stirring, this book blends creative narrative with uncommon insight, spiritual depth, and practical application.If you are someone who seeks a renewal of hope, faith, and love, The Day I Met Jesus will make your Bible come to life and usher you into a fresh encounter with your Lord.

That‚Äôs exactly what you can count on throughout The Day I Met Jesus. The authors transport you into the first century latched onto stories of five broken women and their encounter with the Lord of healing, redemption. and grace.Your journey takes off with biblical narratives written as diary entries from an adulteress caught in the act, prostitute who loved extravagantly, multiple divorc√©e currently living in sin, defiled, isolated patient with an incessant flow of blood, and a friend who was one of Jesus‚Äôs much-loved disciples.Each one masterfully prepares the scene where we get to live in their skin; see things though their eyes, feel what they felt. Their first-person account brings you to a better understanding of who they were and what their lives must have been like. Each word pointing to that moment in time that changed everything, setting the stage for us to eavesdrop on their transforming encounter with Jesus. Words that paint, in living colour, what it means to be loved, forgiven, restored, healed. As we slip into their shoes, we detect footprints of someone we know much like them and catch glimpses of ourselves. Their stories, though experienced long ago, contain a timeless universality that seamlessly joins past events to present relevance.As I came to know those women from their perspective, I was eager to overlay their memoirs onto the Sacred Text that immediately follows. Comparing their reflections with the Gospel made what took place more real, vivid and meaningful. Even more so with the Walking it Out section that concludes the chapter. That‚Äôs where it‚Äôs our turn to meet Jesus. Where the authors zoom in on more insights and finer details of the culture, lifestyle and beliefs at the time of Christ. They also put together the Talking it Over questions at back of the book to help us interact with the biblical narrative on our own or in a group setting,The Day I Met Jesus reveals how there is so much than what meets the eye. Things I never thought of before. Like how was it the accusers just happened to catch that woman in adultery? That Mary of Bethany who brazenly sat at Jesus‚Äôs feet, boldly poured expensive perfume over His feet, quietly held back defending herself against disapproval. It was a real eye-opener when the authors pointed out the unlikelihood the Samaritan woman, marred with a stained reputation, would be taken seriously when she returned to her village telling people about her exchange with Jesus. Yet, they followed her back to see for themselves and were subsequently converted. Clearly, they noticed something different about her.I loved the way this book captures how the Jesus who touched the lives of those women wants to do the same for you and me. Forgiveness, grace, acceptance and boundless love are ours. Today. Here and now. Sins, mistakes, hurts washed away to make room for life redeemed and free. Shame is wiped away and new life springs forth. Once we  meet Jesus, our lives will never be the same again. Just like the five women.I met Jesus in a new and powerful way through this book. I think you will too.Disclosure ‚Äì Many thanks to BakerBooks for the complimentary copy of the book in exchange for this unbiased review.\n\n', '\n\n  This book beautifully writes 5 perspectives of women in the gospels. This book brings alive the testimonies and lives of women who Jesus ministered to. I enjoyed how the authors gave a cultural understanding of the background of these women with a most likely story of what they would have been going through and thinking. It helped me to understand these women in a deeper level and a greater understanding of the power of the love of Jesus.This book has been provided courtesy of Graf-Martin Communications and Baker Publishing Group. :)\n\n']"

  A ""sublimely creepy"" psychological thriller from #1 New York Times bestselling author Colleen Hoover (Tarryn Fisher, New York Times bestselling author).Lowen Ashleigh is a struggling writer on the brink of financial ruin when she accepts the job offer of a lifetime. Jeremy Crawford, husband of bestselling author Verity Crawford, has hired Lowen to complete the remaining books in a successful series his injured wife is unable to finish.¬†Lowen arrives at the Crawford home, ready to sort through years of Verity‚Äôs notes and outlines, hoping to find enough material to get her started. What Lowen doesn‚Äôt expect to uncover in the chaotic office is an unfinished autobiography Verity never intended for anyone to read. Page after page of bone-chilling admissions, including Verity's recollection of the night her family was forever altered.¬†Lowen decides to keep the manuscript hidden from Jeremy, knowing its contents could devastate the already grieving father. But as Lowen‚Äôs feelings for Jeremy begin to intensify, she recognizes all the ways she could benefit if he were to read his wife‚Äôs words. After all, no matter how devoted Jeremy is to his injured wife, a truth this horrifying would make it impossible for him to continue loving her.

I usually enjoy domestic psychological thrillers, but need to have one likeable character with which to empathize. I found all three main characters despicable.  An attempt here to combine erotica with a  thriller detracted from any buildup of mystery and suspense for me. The many sex scenes were quite explicit, and perhaps I am becoming prudish, but I wanted more a more creepy factor. This certainly existed but kept being pushed into the background by both women‚Äôs lust for Jeremy. There was a good plot somewhere here, but sad to say I felt all these hateful people deserved one another. The ending seemed forced and implausible.\n\n', '\n\n  I‚Äôve read quite a few of Colleen Hoover‚Äôs novels and been impressed by how emotionally intense her love stories are. So when I saw she wrote her first suspense thriller, I knew I was in for a quite a ride.The novel follows Lowen Asleigh, a struggling author, who‚Äôs in a dire financial state. She‚Äôs gotten an eviction notice for her apartment and doesn‚Äôt have a new manuscript to sell to publishers, having spend most of her time caring for her terminally ill mother. Then she gets an offer of a lifetime. Bestselling Verity Crawford has gotten badly injured in car accident and her husband, Jeremy Crawford, wants Lowen to finish her popular novel series. Desperate to keep a roof over her head, Lowen accepts. She comes over to the Crawford‚Äôs secluded house in Virginia to go through Verity‚Äôs notes and outlines for future novels. Instead, she stumbles upon Verity‚Äôs unfinished autobiography detailing disturbing thoughts and chilling admissions, including a confession of what really happened the day Verity and Jeremy‚Äôs daughter died. Should Lowen show the autobiography to Jeremy, who‚Äôs a devoted to his injured wife and oblivious to her true character? Or keep it to herself and not devastate an already grieving father and husband?I honestly didn‚Äôt know much more than that going into this novel and I feel like that really is the best way of experiencing it. Go into this blind and the reveals and admissions will horrify you.There were parts that difficult for me to read, that left me feeling sick to my stomach. And yet, I couldn‚Äôt stop reading out of morbid curiosity. I needed to know what will happen next. How will it end? And yes, the ending shocked me more than the whole book. It left me second guessing everything I thought knew leading up to it. And yet, it fits so well!My opinions on the characters changed from like to hate and hate to like by the time the novel ended. I won‚Äôt say who I liked and disliked for that will spoil it (and I will want readers going into this blind!). But I will say this, there are two points of views in this novel, Lowen‚Äôs and Verity‚Äôs, and they‚Äôre very distinct from each other. The pacing didn‚Äôt drag or feel rushed, it felt even, just perfect.Do yourself a favour and don‚Äôt read this at night like I did. I really regretted it because I was freaking out and unable to sleep. This story is definitely going to haunt me.\n\n', ""\n\n  This is a good vs evil relationship dynamic, set inside the very intimate quarters of marriage turned family. It only gets worse when the most innocent are forced to pay the highest price of all. Heartbreaking! Author Colleen Hoover, unleashes the most terrifying & unfit of character's. Meet Verity, trusted wife, mother and best-selling author, aka selfish, sex-crazed, obsessive, control-freak psychopath. A woman devoid of conscience who runs roughshod over her sweet children and partner, by giving them no voice. Wouldn't ya know it? Evil Verity marries Jeremy, a golden Saint of a man, who any woman would deem herself the luckiest woman alive, to call him husband.  He is the loving personification of husband, father, citizen - a true family man, tasked with the role of  chief bottle-washer and nurturer, but not in a weak way. ENTER Lowen - the reluctant heroin of the story. She is hired by Jeremy to finish writing some books for Verity, after a car accident. A final twist is thrown into the plot at the end of the book, presenting us with a startling new revelation which gives us pause, with much left to think about. This book is not without its weaknesses, but overall, I recommend this absorbing novel.\n\n"", '\n\n  I hate Verity Crawford.This book had me on the edge of my seat from the first sentence. I have read some pretty dark reads and loved every word of them but this dark book was even more twisted. I couldn\'t put it down, except of course when real life called.  The detail of characters is very intriguing and I knew from the moment that Verity ""looks"" through the window at Lowen that she saw her.The story in the story always fascinates me because technically you get two great reads in one and this is no exception. The twists & turns draw you in and honestly the manuscript whether was supposed to be what actually happened and the note discovered after was to cover it up or not just left me with my mouth hanging open.  I honestly feel that the 5 star rating system need to change because 5 stars just seems like a low score for such an amazing book.Thanks for the ability to read this Ms. Hoover, it\'s amazing.\n\n']"

She very quickly gets what she asks for when she finds out that her unknown father was a very powerful man and, since his death, she is the only one of his bloodline remaining- a bloodline that is needed to save her world from a dark and deadly force. Along with a ragtag group of misfits (a squire who could never quite make it as a knight, an assassin eager for revenge, a bounty hunter, a sorceress, an Immortal and a counterfeiter) Corayne travels distant lands she only dreamed of, but now everything she knows and loves is on the line and she must be willing to risk it all.Victoria Aveyard returns to the YA fantasy world with her new novel, ‚ÄúRealm Breaker‚Äù. I was a fan of Aveyard‚Äôs previous ‚ÄúRed Queen‚Äù series, and was very excited to get my hands on this (LENGTHY!) novel.‚ÄúRealm Breaker‚Äù very much had a ‚ÄúGame of Thrones‚Äù aspect to it, in that there are several ancient kingdoms at war for the crown, with knights, Royalty, Immortals, witches and a plain old normal protagonist, disowned by her father, with a ‚Äúspecial gift‚Äù. Honestly, even the lands themselves reminded me of the various Kingdoms in the GOT series, and the ‚Äúraised from the Dead‚Äù army was something right out of Martin‚Äôs fantasy world. Good thing for Aveyard- I‚Äôm a huge fan of Thrones, and George R.R. Martin.Corayne is exactly what you‚Äôd expect from a young, female protagonist. Desperate to find her place to fit in, she soon discovers that she (and only she) can save the entire world. Sure, it‚Äôs a trope that‚Äôs been done before (again and again), but it doesn‚Äôt make it any less entertaining.I enjoyed the characters in Aveyard‚Äôs novel, as she manages to make each and every one (good and evil alike!) show redeemable qualities. There is almost a constant stream of action, with swordplay, regular old fisticuffs and even fights on horseback (which led to death and harm of some horses, which I am NOT happy about!).Each chapter was narrated by one of the main characters, and it was clearly marked and identified. Corayne was the main narrator of course, but the majority of the others take their turns as well. Not only did this method bring more depth to Corayne‚Äôs journey and its importance, but it shed some light on the characters and lands that exist in this world, outside of Corayne‚Äôs own.Aveyard is obviously going to be continuing this journey with future novels, which the ending suggests, but there was also enough of a conclusion to be completely gratifying. With action-packed twists and fantastically quirky main characters, I am definitely looking forward to reading more of the ‚ÄúRealm Breaker‚Äù series.\n\n', ""\n\n  I really enjoyed the Red Queen series so I was very existed to read Victoria Aveyard's newest release! Realm Breaker is very different from Red Queen. It is a high fantasy story with multiple pov characters. It gave me Game of Thrones vibe. There has very well thought out and expansive world building and it's implied that there is this rich history to it. We also get chapters from different characters that are all interconnected and from different sides of the conflict. There's a squire, an immortal, an assassin, a queen, and the heir to kingdom. To me it read a lot more like high fantasy than ya which made it a little difficult to get into at first. It really started too pick up towards the middle to the end of the book. That being said not a whole lot happens in this first instalment. It's very much a setup for the next book. I'm interested to see how the story continues to play out and I hope that there are more chapters from Erida's point of view because she is by far my favourite character. So much so that I felt some of the other characters chapters dragged on or were unnecessary. I really excited to see how a certain relationship of her plays out.Overall 3.5 starsRecommend for high fantasy fans that enjoy rich world building and multi-pov stories\n\n""]"

They have a long history, most of it as best friends,  but his broken promises and rather misguided attempt to guide her toward her dreams have left them at odds and feeling like adversaries rather than friends. After years away, they are both in there home town again, but her stay is temporary, just until her grandmother heals from her hip replacement. A rather naughty, escape-artist pig serves to expedite their reunion, a reunion filled with fright induced anger and recriminations. Weston‚Äôs PTSD and status as a recovering alcoholic serve as reasons to keep his Shel at a distance, and his grumpy, prickly attitude help to get the job done. Being back home is bittersweet for Shel. Yes, she gets to spend quality time with her grandmother and brother, and reconnect with friends, but having Weston nearby is torture. She has never stopped loving him, even when he failed to keep his promise to write her while he is when in the army and basically ghosted her. She left home for her education and dream of a career in preserving history, but she still wants to know why he broke his promises and why they are now more like enemies than friends. Strange incidents and strangers as well as his mischievous pig who had a crush on Shel, keep nudging Weston and Shel toward each other. Weston is at war with his conscience and his need to protect Shel. The chemistry and history between them is hard to ignore and soon passion takes over. But he tells himself it is temporary, she is leaving and that they don‚Äôt have a future together. The strange incidents soon take a dangerous turn, and Shel and Weston are scrambling to protect loved ones and each other. Will these two take a chance on a happily ever after or will they suffer more heartbreak?I loved Weston and Shel. They are both strong-willed, stubborn, passionate and big-hearted. Their chemistry is over the top, combustible and impossible to ignore. Their story provides lots of steamy, passionate encounters and a beautiful, eternal love that both try very hard to deny right up until the moment they finally surrender to it.

Easier said than done, however.  West was a man haunted by his war experiences; certain he was damaged beyond redemption and resolved to keep Shel in the dark and at arm‚Äôs length.  Again, not so easily done.  As a couple, I enjoyed the ease of their connection, and the sizzling chemistry between them.  I quite loved Hercules ‚Äì West‚Äôs 100 lb. pet pig.  His very human-like behaviour, intelligence and amusing interactions with Shel and West, was very entertaining.Overall, there‚Äôs plenty of action, drama and some violence, humour and flirty banter along with several steamy, explicit scenes.

I am in hog heaven.  I love pigs so this story reeled me in immediately.  As a young girl, Rachel was part of the 3 Musketeers with her brother Marty and the crush of her life, Weston.  He always knew the right things to say including his corny jokes when she was feeling down.  Weston was her champion, her Knight on a White Charger.  But he only saw her as Marty's kid sister.She was devastated when he went into the Army and left her wondering why he did not write her like he said he would.  Rachel moved on and left her small town determined to see her dreams come to fruition.  Many years later, she returns home to realize Weston is back.  When Weston sees Rachel, he is shocked to see how much she has grown both physically and mentally. He knows he cannot go back to how they were before. He is not the same person she remembers when they were younger.Their story is heart wrenching and will pull your emotions right out of your chest.  They both will not admit their true feelings for each other. These two together with a pig that is smart as a whip (and steals many scenes in this story), will have you rooting for everything to work out.

  It can safely be said that Lord Barnaby Greenwood is not having the best of Christmases.He‚Äôs penniless, up to his eyeballs in debt, and about to lose his estate. Therefore, it‚Äôs hardly surprising that when a local property developer offers a lot of money to buy King‚Äôs Wood from him, Barnaby is very tempted. But his father had always impressed on him that the green wood was sacred and must be protected at all costs, so he finds himself saying no.He knows this will result in the loss of his home, but duty comes before everything. However, that fateful decision leads instead to a magical Christmas for Barnaby, complete with an old god who grants him a favour, and a beautiful statue that comes to life.Cosmo is perfect for him.

While he is there, he meets the Holly King who rewards him for saving the Wood by bringing that statue to life, only until Christmas Eve ‚Äì 5 days. Cosmo, the statue, has been given access to magic by the Holly King and his use of it is really funny as is his naivete when it comes to humans.

A hopeless task, made all the worse by the bad blood between her and Thanatos. But Death‚Äôs attraction to her is undeniable, and try though she might, Lazarus cannot stay away from that ancient, beautiful being and his dark embrace.The end is here.

  From the number-one bestselling author of The Nightingale and The Great Alone comes a powerful American epic about love and heroism and hope, set during the Great Depression, a time when the country was in crisis and at war with itself, when millions were out of work and even the land seemed to have turned against them. ‚ÄúMy land tells its story if you listen. The story of our family.‚ÄùTexas, 1921.  A time of abundance.  The Great War is over, the bounty of the land is plentiful, and America is on the brink of a new and optimistic era.  But for Elsa Wolcott, deemed too old to marry in a time when marriage is a woman‚Äôs only option, the future seems bleak.  Until the night she meets Rafe Martinelli and decides to change the direction of her life.  With her reputation in ruin, there is only one respectable choice: marriage to a man she barely knows.By 1934, the world has changed; millions are out of work and drought has devastated the Great Plains. Farmers are fighting to keep their land and their livelihoods as crops fail and water dries up and the earth cracks open.  Dust storms roll relentlessly across the plains.  Everything on the Martinelli farm is dying, including Elsa‚Äôs tenuous marriage; each day is a desperate battle against nature and a fight to keep her children alive.In this uncertain and perilous time, Elsa‚Äîlike so many of her neighbors‚Äîmust make an agonizing choice: fight for the land she loves or leave it  behind and go west, to California, in search of a better life for her family.The Four Winds is a rich, sweeping novel that stunningly brings to life the Great Depression and the people who lived through it‚Äîthe harsh realities that divided us as a nation and the enduring battle between the haves and the have-nots.  A testament to hope, resilience, and the strength of the human spirit to survive adversity, The Four Winds is an indelible portrait of America and the American dream, as seen through the eyes of one indomitable woman whose courage and sacrifice will come to define a generation.

It\'s all the same.""\n', '\nPerseverance\n']","['\n\n  I must admit that I am stranger to these type of pedastrian plot driven popular novels.  I loved the quasi historical fiction element of the Dust Bowl migration outling the classist inhumane treatment of migrants in their own  country.  This is despicable and although no where even close to the abomination  of slavery, we do get to see the areas where classism and racism have similarities.My problem with the novel is that is so simplistic. I suppose this author knows her audience and clearly it is not me.The portrayal of the Italian American family alerted me immediately to the many flaws in this novel. Italians living in rural farming communities were not buying imported olive and the other stereotypical Italian foods. This part is just silly. These imported products would not have been readily available.Also, the idea that Italian parents would disown a SON and prefer his ""white"" girlfriend who shows up pregnant, is again very silly. Anyone who knows anything about Italian sons knows that their mothers never reject them in favour of pregnant white girls. The next thing about this is the casting of Italians as another race using expressions of ""dark"" and ""olive skinned.""  Italians are members of the white race and although they were cast as different and discriminated against for their culture, they were still white.As for the ""communist"" labour organizers there is nothing out of the ordinary about this, but it interesting to see reviews about how offensive any reference to communism is to some readers. One must remember this is before the realizations about totalitarian governments were very different than true Marxism.Now for our heroine, she is an OK character. She sacrifices everything for her family and the majority of women understand that deep love of one\'s children that permeates and consumes our lives.Overall, I could not finish this repetitive novel. It seems the author who I see churns these types of books out for her legion of fans, also just rehashes the same chapters over and over. It\'s like each new chapter is just a rewritten summary of the one before it. I was astounded she gets away with this to be honest in her attempt to churn out 400 pages... I must also add that the bedroom  scene near the end where Jack wants the ""lights on"" so he can ""see her"" made me laugh out loud. So hokey.This book is an attempt to write a Harlequin romance version of Grapes of Wrath.\n\n', ""\n\n  I grew up with a Dad who lived through the dirty 30s in Saskatchewan, where there are a lot of similarities in terms of what the dust storms, etc., were like.  Everything described in this book in regard to the weather matches the stories he told me.  I also read the Grapes of Wrath many years ago and this book reminded me of that, in terms of illustrating the despair of the people.  I found this book to be just stunning.  I learned a great deal about the migrant workers in California at the time.  I thought that Elsa was one of the most powerful females I've read in a book in recent memory.  The author did a beautiful job of depicting how Elsa finally found her voice.  Every bit of this book was believable.  Every character was living and breathing and speaking in my mind's eye.  I could hardly put it down and stayed up late last night because I simply had to finish it.  Yes, the subject matter is filled with despair and hopelessness, however, there is a thread of hope and positivity and strength that runs through the whole thing and saves it from being a depressing read.  This is a book I will likely read again and I expect I will find even more depth in each character when I do.\n\n"", ""\n\n  This excellent book about the Dust Bowl and the Great Depression has taken me back to my grandmother's stories about the era. After one year of COVID-19, this book showed me how this period, tragic as it is, pales in comparison to what the greatest generation endured for more than a decade.\n\n"", '\n\n  ""Be Brave... or pretend to be. It\'s all the same.""This is one of my favourite quotes in this inspiring, touching and eloquently written novel by Kristin Hannah.Elsa pretended to be brave her entire life, was quiet and at times subdued, until she was faced with her children\'s survival, and their future. Then she realized that she was brave.I gave this novel 4 stars, although it touched me deeply, and I did shed multiple tears throughout the time it took me to read it. It was a depressing tale, that during these dire times today, made me feel the ultimate sadness; for the people during the depression, for the Oakies, and for those during today\'s epic tales of struggle and despair.""Hope has taught me to stand up and find my woman\'s voice even in this mans world.""Elsa\'s character was always afraid to step out of her comfort zone, to do the inexplicable and to live and love a mundane life because that was all she knew, or that she thought she knew.She is a character to be admired, and unlike any character that I have known Hannah to write. She depicted Elsa as a true heroine in every sense of the word, her struggles with being a wife, being a mother, and being a woman were written in such a way that you were sentenced to sit back and reflect on your own struggles.As usual the imagery associated with Hannah\'s writing was second to none, as was her character definition, because every character in this novel is ultimately unforgettable.Another great one from Kristin Hannah.Thank you for writing this novel.\n\n', '\n\n  Someone on Good Reads suggested this was their favorite book, I must admit it wasn‚Äôt my favorite , nor was it her best in my opinion. I believe books come to us when we need them and had I read this during a different time in my life it might have meant more to me. That being said, it was well written and taught us about a part of history I‚Äôd never read much about before. It teaches us about hardships and how that makes us better people, slowly and almost without us realizing it . Elsa was a warrior in so many ways.\n\n']"

The amount of character development, however, is insurmountably greater than in the first instance. Many characters that struggled to accept plot-relevant revelations finally realize that, in one of the best inner reflections in the series so far, ""death is lighter than a feather, and duty heavier than a mountain.""My favorite character from the first book appeared again, resurrecting from uncertain death, some new characters were introduced and one completely stole the scenes he was featured in. Reading Hurin and Rand\'s interactions always brought a smile to my face, and the progression of tone in their conversations served well to foretell heavier stakes in the story. Subtle, yet expertly done.The motivation behind Thom\'s decision to eventually follow Rand\'s journey was undoubtedly the most shocking moment in the entire book. I was not expecting the sudden loss and determination birthed from such a tragic event. While being intrinsically realistic, given the absurd setting and culture of the people from Cairhien, it was also heartbreaking to recognize that the wheel cares not for the plans of men. If in the first book characterization was good, in the second it gets even better. All major characters renew their determination, face difficulties that will mold their future interactions, and set in motion events that promise to change the life of everyone in the books to come.The world is further increased in size and complexity with all the lore, important regions visited, and new threats that appear from unknown lands. Just from reading the first two books, I can already tell that The Wheel of Time is among the best fiction world ever written, and I can not wait to see the plotlines and worldbuilding all come to fruition in the next instances of the series.The Great Hunt was an all-around improvement when compared with the previous entry, but it still suffers from the same slow buildup that only gets satisfyingly tight-paced towards the conclusion. That, in my opinion, is not completely a negative point, as all the worldbuilding and character development is fundamental if a gratifying completion is desired. However, the initial seventy percent of the story still distinctively feels like a huge setup and can get difficult to push through all shifts in point of view.\n\n', '\n\n  the best saga I have ever read and will ever read. I have read the wheel of time twice and am going for the third re-read because the final chapter is coming out. Honestly I have read other fantasy books but nothing comes even remotely close to Jordans world of intricate characters and sub plots.

This kind of pattern always screws me up (I‚Äôm a one or two session reader, often just one!) and leaves me uncertain how I feel about a story. Enter, FOR THE WOLF.I liked so much of this but was equally confused by just as much. This is a story that I definitely need to reread because I think it‚Äôs possible this would be an easy four star if I had read it normally.There are shades of familiar fairytales woven into the roots of this spooky forest magic story. But these parts are made equally their own thing. This is not YA but is written with similar YA beats, yet manages to be dark without crossing any ‚Äòcan‚Äôt turn back now‚Äô lines.While this had some absolutely lovely turns of phrase, a slowburn romance, and tons of forest aesthetic, I definitely lost track of some scenes or events as they played out, and I did find myself losing the thread of the worldbuiling (probably explained in the beginning and then just forgotten, because I‚Äôm dumb and was too slow to read this; though I also think the mythology is supposed to be uncertain and skewed and that doesn‚Äôt help?), but I am definitely going to be keen for the follow up.\n\n', '\n\n  ‚ÄúI‚Äôd let the world burn before I hurt you.‚ÄùThis adult, gothic reimagining of Little Red Riding Hood somehow reminded me of not just Little Red Riding Hood but also Beauty and the Beast and Snow White too. For the Wolf has all the things I need to get invested in a story. Retelling, romance, mystery, elemental magic, enchanted forest, complicated relationships - I got all these just from reading the first chapter.Fascinatingly twisted from the start, the mystery was more than enough to make me keep reading. I‚Äôve always loved a story set in an enchanted forest/woodland and For the Wolf has all of what I loved and more with its magical world building. Played with the combination of myth, folklore and fairytale, a fantasy lover would love this story that has an eerie and spooky atmosphere.And while I fell in love with the theme of the story and its promising start, my feelings slowly changed mainly due to the excessive amount of exposition that left me confused at times. I also find conflicts that could have been resolved through proper communication is not my favorite.Perhaps because of the image that Little Red Riding Hood planted in my head, I expected more angst and banter from Red and Wolf. I got more interested with the secondary characters and I wish there was more of Raffe.I loved the setting and the overall aesthetic and I‚Äôm still interested to know what happens next because I‚Äôm definite that For the Wolf is just the beginning of a more twisted and darker world.Trigger Warnings provided by the author:-Self harm for magic use (cutting)-Parental neglect/emotional abuse-Mentions of physical symptoms that might be triggering to those with emetophobia-Anxiety/panic attacks-Parental death-Gore-Mild audio/visual hallucinations-Religious abuse-Medium-heat romance (non-explicit)\n\n', '\n\n  This is a dark, richly imagined world where the Big Bad Wolf isn‚Äôt exactly what you were always told.It‚Äôs a world where the First Daughter is for the Throne, the Second Daughter is for the Wolf, and the Wolf is for the Wilderwood.Twin sisters Red and Neve are devastated that soon Red will be sent to the Wilderwood forest as a sacrifice to the Wolf. Legend has it that the Wolf demanded that payment in exchange for keeping the monsters of the forest at bay. The people also want the Five Kings back, and they hope that this human sacrifice will appease the Wolf enough to free them. When Red arrives at the forest she discovers that her knowledge of the Wilderwood and the Wolf are mostly tall tales and soon she will have to harness her mysterious and budding powers to save her world.This novel has the classic dark and brooding male love interest, the heroine who doesn‚Äôt need any man to save her, and a few evil villains added to the mix. It is a slowly paced tale with rich detail that never feels like information overload. I prefer fantasy with well-developed characters over heavy plot and world-building. This book struck a nice balance between fully imagined characters and a forest that literally comes alive.I took one star off because, sometimes, I found the plot dragged. The romance wasn‚Äôt for me, but I‚Äôm sure others will enjoy it.Still, I can‚Äôt wait for the sequel!\n\n', ""\n\n  This came up as a suggestion at my local public library... I'm glad I took it.- It's modern twist on some older fairy tales... Yeah, the plot is kind of predictable (good vs evil), but eh! it's a fairy tale, not a thriller. Just turn your brain off and enjoy the story and try to imagine the scenery.Looking forward to her next book ;-)\n\n"", '\n\n  I love, love, loved this book. The characters are dynamic and tortured, the imagery rich and beautiful. There is also fantastic interplay between politics and religion and myth, compelling the reader to question what is good and evil and what just is. The bonds of obligation, love, and family tie this book together beautifully. I eagerly anticipating the next.\n\n', '\n\n  Loved this so much!

She was hard working, feisty, smart and quick with a clever comeback when taunted with insults meant to belittle her.  I enjoyed how Nero and Camille first connected through their mutual love of classic cars.  As a mechanic herself, she truly was the rare female who could keep him intrigued outside of the bedroom.  As a couple these two were drawn together like steel to a magnet forming a tight connection through their similar life experiences.While this story is a bit of a departure from the chaos and vengeful scheming we‚Äôve witnessed in the previous tales, it does contain some violence along with plenty of drama, action, adventure and suspense.

Nero and Camille bring out mostly the best out of one another, even when they banned together to commit a crime.

This book will pull you in immediately, it contains twists and turns that drive the story forward and challenge the characters. Nero and Camille figure out they make a good team while they also find themselves in an unlikely but steamy relationship. Enjoy this amazing book!

I will preface this by saying that it wasn't my normal type of book. It wasn't thrilling, it didn't keep you on the edge of your seat. It was, however, very thought provoking. Matt Haig takes a very serious and prevlant issue in today's society - mental health- and centers and entire book around it. I found myself very curious about which life Nore would ultimately choose, if she would go back to her root life or whether she would choose any at all. There are so many possibilities in life, if we had only made a tiny or sometimes massive alteration in the choices we make. The book raised a lot of very interesting and relatable points about the regrets we all have in life, and while you may regret them, you ultimately regret what you think may have happened had you chosen a different path, not what could have happened. For example, if you regretted breaking up with an ex, what may have happened if you stayed. Your thoughts always tend towards the positive, but what if it hadn't been positive? Typically most people regret something, but no on truly knows what would have happened, positive or negative if you had chosen differently. This book makes you think in a way most fiction novels don't, and it teaches the reader a good life lesson... the choices you make, help shape you into the person you are... but those choices don't define who you are. You are whatever you want to be, and you are never trapped, sometimes it just feels that way. There is always a way out, and you matter. ü•∞\n\n"", ""\n\n  Everyone should read this book.We've all wondered what our lives would be like had we made different decisions - now we can see what it would be like to live those lives.Matt Haig is a genius author who brings the reader so deep into the story that we feel a part of the story, and we likely were meant to be.

Thank you, Matt for coming into my life and lifting my soul! Xo‚ÄòTo fear love is to fear life, and those who fear life are already three-parts dead‚Äô.\n\n"", '\n\n  The Midnight Library by Matt Haig is one of those books that really make you examine your existence as well as the choices you have made to get to where you are. Imagine there was a place where you could try another life you could have lived. A place where you could see how things would have been if you had made other choices. The question posed: What would you have done differently, if you had a chance to undo your regrets? This book is a mix of fiction and fantasy. It is written beautifully and is really touching. It‚Äôs lighthearted but also deeply moving and real. I felt every emotion while reading it. At the beginning of the book the main character gives up all hope in living only to discover through lessons learned along the way, that life is worth living. It taught me to be grateful of everything and everyone. It has easily become one of my favourite books of all time. I laughed, I cried, and I thoroughly enjoyed every bit of it.\n\n', '\n\n  This book was a great read and causes you to think about your own life path and the decisions made to get where you are. Really makes you realize that no version of life is ever perfect, and we need to appreciate what we have whenever possible.I thoroughly enjoyed this book and am going to be checking out other books by this author.\n\n', '\n\n  It was outlandish, creative, deeply moving, and just plain fun! You will be rooting for Nora to figure her life out!Books as portals? Yes please.\n\n', '\n\n  I loved the concept of Midnight Library. What if on the day of your death you could go back and see the lives you would have lived if only you had made certain choices differently. If you could fix your biggest, and smallest, regrets and see if you would have lived a happier more meaningful life. After losing her job and cat in the same day, a depressed Nora Seed gets this chance after chasing a bottle of antidepressants with one of wine.If you get past the stretch of imagination it takes to get you to the midnight library where Nora spends most of the book suspended between life and death you\'re in for an amazing book. A book about how the grass isn\'t always greener on the other side of the fence. And how the smallest changes in you and how you live your life can deeply impact those in your periphery. Like how no longer teaching piano to a young boy removes the last barrier keeping him from a life of mischief and crime. Or how not living in the house you reside in in your root life, being able to get meds for, and help take care of your aging neighbour means he ends up losing his independence and living in a nursing home.Haig writes a thought provoking novel about how all our decisions, big and small, have the grandest effects. And the choices we make about will truly make us happy. Making us answer for ourselves "" what is the best way to live"". And an underlying reminder that no matter how inconsequential we may think we are, we are all the difference to someone else.***TW: suicide, depression, overdose, death of a pet***\n\n']"

Since I have a vivid imagination and am familiar with the setting in Germany, I had no problems getting 'deeply' involved in the story. I didn't like Jack at the beginning since he seemed a bit rude and not always nice to his friend Sherk, who invited him to come along to visit Germany. Jack did not tell his friend that he had a special reason to accompany him. After I learned of the tragic loss of his wife and daughter through a bombing in Ireland, I understood him.It seemed a little far-fetched to find a lady who sent a letter from Munich to Jack's father about sixty years earlier without an address. But, familiar with German perfectionism, I accepted that it happened. I had to smile at how the author, Meg Lelvis, found a way to lead the reader deftly into the holocaust, the horror that happened in Dachau, one location of the concentration camps where undesirables and Jews were terminated. Some people might not read the book if they knew in advance...Meg is a psychologist and knows how to create characters that make you love or hate them. The feelings I experienced were one aspect I kept on reading - even if at times I would have given up. Despite a couple of anticipated surprises, the ending does not completely satisfy - unless it is book 3 of a series and another book is coming.

The club rules require anonymity, so they leave without exchanging names or contact information. But of course, they meet again in the real world! Tristan and Freddie are individually wonderful characters and together they really become extraordinary.This opening had me half-expecting the kind of story in which the dominant alpha introduces his employee to kinky outfits, furtive half-dressed encounters in the room with the photocopier and the office supplies, and daring spectacles with the Gilded Room crowd. But it wasn\'t that at all; in fact, they never undress at the Gilded Room again!There is one scene in which Tristan thinks Freddie is a man but he refers to her as ""she"" and ""her"" in a paragraph.

I love her sass as she gives as good as she gets.  Tristan is an absolute sweetheart andI is so caring and thoughtful.

If you want a story with sex, romance, humour, and intrigue,then this is a must read.I received an advance review copy for free, and I am leaving this review voluntarily.\n\n', '\n\n  Think Outside the Boss was fast-paced, funny and entrancing. Olivia\'s given us to characters I wanted to invest time in and get to know, and she managed to steer away from the usual tropes of ""whoops, I slept with the man I now realise is my new boss"" by giving us a strong female protagonist and a strong but caring and thoughtful male lead. I\'d like to think that I would have made the decisions Freddie made, which is perhaps why I liked her as much as I did. I really loved meeting Freddie and Tristan and can\'t wait to read about Anthony in the next instalment. (ARC)\n\n']"

  Wall Street Journal bestsellerWatch your most innovative ideas take flight by overcoming the forces that resist change The Human Element‚ÄØis for anyone who wants to introduce a new idea or innovation into the world. Most marketers, innovators, executives, activists, or anyone else in the business of creating change, operate on a deep assumption. It is the belief that the best (and perhaps only) way to convince people to embrace a new idea is to heighten the appeal of the idea itself. We instinctively believe that if we add enough value, people will eventually say ""yes."" This reflex leads us down a path of adding features and benefits to our ideas or increasing the sizzle of our messaging - all in the hope of getting others on board. We call this instinct the ""Fuel-based mindset."" The Fuel-based mindset explains so much of what we do, from adding countless trivial features to software, to bolting a sixth blade onto a shaving razor. By focusing on Fuel, innovators neglect the other half of the equation ‚Äì the psychological Frictions that oppose change. Frictions create drag on innovation. And though they are rarely considered, overcoming these Frictions is essential for bringing new ideas into the world. The Human Element highlights the four Frictions that operate against innovation. Readers will discover:  Why their best ideas and initiatives often get rejected ‚Äì despite their undeniable value How to disarm the forces of resistance that act against change How to transform the very Frictions that hold us back into catalysts for change  Perfect for business leaders, product managers, educators, and anyone else who seeks to bring new and exciting ideas to life, The Human Element is an indispensable resource to help people overcome the powerful forces of human nature that instinctively resist change.

Stories that made them unique even though they are brothers and grew up in the same house of horrors.  I think it was important that it wasn\'t just Shayne who needs to rethink the way they see the world but the four of them in order to come together.There were points of the book where I felt like I was reading a dark retelling of beauty and the beast and that honestly made me love it even more.

They do all the work to make the bride‚Äôs day perfect. They follow along with the bride‚Äôs wishes and deal with the mounting pressure of the big day. The focus is always on the bride. Nina Manning‚Äôs, ‚ÄúThe Bridesmaid,‚Äù mirrors this relationship in an unlikely friendship between two girls.Sasha first met Caitlin at Saxby House when they were children. Sasha‚Äôs parents work for the Clemonte‚Äôs on their estate. The girls were besties, inseparable, until the day Sasha has had enough. Enough of having to do things Caitlin‚Äôs way. Enough of putting up with Caitlin‚Äôs odd behaviour. Enough of the secrets.This novel is about toxic relationships and explores the reason behind these types of friendships. A slow burner, and more a mystery than a thriller, you‚Äôll discover that nothing is as it seems. Like the one on the cover, a rose is beautiful to look at and has a beautiful aroma. However, every rose has its thorn and this rose, the bride, has a few. In an attempt to keep secrets for appearance's sake, people fail to connect with the most important people around them - thus perpetuating the problem. This is the bridesmaid‚Äôs story from the beginning of the friendship to the end of it.The author studied psychology and applied it to the relationships in this book. It‚Äôs a decades-long journey into why people behave the way they do. It‚Äôs a unique read because, for most of the book, the main characters are teenagers. Most psychological thrillers I‚Äôve read have adult protagonists.I was gifted this advance copy by Nina Manning, Boldwood Books and NetGalley and was under no obligation to provide a review.\n\n"", '\n\n  I was unsure what to rate this. I really enjoyed this book and got sucked into it and boy was it ever a readable page turner...BUT it was not a thriller...not by my definition. This was more like a dramatic chick lit story with a bit of a mystery thrown in and I really liked it.The plot was interesting and I loved the format of before and now. It is told from the singular point of view and you really got to know the two main characters because of that. I really appreciate Nina Mannings writing style and the way she keeps you wanting to know more. The whole time I was reading this I kept saying to myself ""just one more chapter"".

Most of the story was a slow build towards what I was hoping would be a carefully constructed surprise ending, but instead the last portion seemed rushed and more telling than showing. So great concept but the execution left something to be desired. But then again, I am picky. For readers who are just looking for a good distraction during pandemic lockdown or a distracting beach read, they'll like this. For those interested in authentic characters, clean story line and aha ending, not so much.\n\n"", '\n\n  3.25 stars.

The pair become fast friends and Sasha finds herself doing anything to maintain her friendship with Caitlin and to keep her happy. Fast forward about twenty years and Sasha, still the supportive friend, is meticulously planning Caitlin‚Äôs wedding to their childhood friend Chuck. As the wedding approaches, things start veering off course.The story is told from Sasha‚Äôs perspective during two timelines: when the girls are teens; and later, in their thirties. The chapters are short, which makes it easy to keep flipping the pages.This was a solid thriller, a bit slow at times, but one that I was still compelled to stay up late reading. I don‚Äôt know how I feel about the ending. I guess I was hoping for something more explosive to the tension that had been building. It did resolve things nicely, so there‚Äôs that.

Lucy is a friendly, delightful young woman who is loved by everyone and Joshua isn‚Äôt. The first day they met Lucy smiled at him and Joshua ignored her and it‚Äôs been war between the two ever since. They are constantly trying to one up the other and their battles are delightfully written. I think I smiled through this entire book. There are so many cute moments in the book from where Lucy speed walks to keep up with Joshua on their way to the kitchen to them both going to HR about the other. The book is told entirely from Lucy‚Äôs POV so we don‚Äôt get why Joshua is such a jerk to her until later in the book and then are hearts start to melt and we all fall in love with him.There are so many already positive reviews for this book and I‚Äôm trying to keep this short so I‚Äôll just finish up with read this book.

Biting and snipping at each other while getting it on. Where is the romance?? 75% into the story and I still don‚Äôt understand what the hell is really going on. It wasn‚Äôt until the last bloody chapter that we finally get any real headway into these characters and they are still holding back. I wanted to throw Josh‚Äôs ribbon pillow in my face and scream GROW UP!!! GAWD!!!!

She definitely added plenty of fun to this.So when a tattooed hot stranger appears in town moving In next door to Natalie she tries to be friendly only to get shut down fairly swiftly.

I found this to be incredibly hot and Kage whilst lethal could also be very sweet. I liked where this went and it was an enjoyable read it‚Äôs slightly instalove which doesn‚Äôt always work for me here it did though and after that finish, I will definitely be picking up book two especially after the dramatic finale.

  So you may ask, who is Adam Connor? He is the recently divorced, Academy Award-winning actor who just moved in next door with his kid.

This one is a slow burn that definitely journeys on the edges of acceptability so it may not be for every reader.However, for the rest of us who willingly follow in Queen Sav's footsteps and eagerly await her words, this one is breathtaking and emotionally enthralling. It has all the signature drama, damaged characters and exquisitely gritty sex scenes that makes a Sav R. Miller book so damn difficult to put down but there's an emotional element to this book that was so relatable and personal that it brought me to tears.The level of tragedy Riley has experienced is almost unfathomable to have survived and Aiden's level of celebrity is not something most would ever know yet I was so drawn to them. Their desire to be seen and loved yet wanting to hide their imperfections at the same time for fear of being unloveable is so universal. I love how it brought a dark sense of reality to this story making it all the more enjoyable because it resonated.This is a story to lose yourself in and just feel it all. From the exposing of every painful truth they wish would stay buried to revelling in every moment of light and softness that happens no matter how small. Riley and Aiden are damaged but not broken. The depth of their chemistry and attraction was so strong, it grabs and pulls you into their orbit. They fall in love in all the most imperfect of ways and I couldn't get enough of how it could feel so wrong but right at the same time.AND let's just be clear, this is not a retelling of the myth of Orpheus & Eurydice either so anyone expecting one can put their freaking 1-star reviews away.

It is a story of love, heartbreak, healing and of renewal. Anitra is a woman with an immense inner strength and fortitude. She nursed her terminally ill son on her own, and though she grieves his loss, she knows in her heart that he is without pain now and playing baseball in heaven. She also knows that God saw fit to bring someone into her life just as she was losing her son along with another unexpected gift. John is a doctor who has seen the circle of life many times in his care of young cancer patients. Heading up the new cancer wing at a hospital in Blueberry Beach would eventually free up more of his time and give him a chance to write books, and perhaps have a personal life for a change. He never expected to meet a pretty woman on the beach at sunset or to have a passionate interlude with her a few nights later. John‚Äôs new job at the hospital brings him back to Blueberry Beach a couple of months later and he doesn‚Äôt realize that she is the mother of one of his young terminally ill cancer patients. John even works with the townspeople to help keep Anitra‚Äôs diner afloat, though he doesn‚Äôt know she is his mystery woman. It isn‚Äôt until her son‚Äôs funeral that John finally realizes that Anitra is the mystery woman who captured his heart on the beach, and that their passionate night together had unforeseen consequences.

I really enjoyed getting to meet them all and hope to read or listen to more books in this series so I can come to know them all better.  I thought the storyline for this book was beautiful but also so very sad.  I also liked the fact that Ms. Gussman made the people real, even though the main characters are Christians she showed how they can still make mistakes but know that God forgives a repentant heart.  I would definitely recommend this book to anyone who enjoys a real story that could definitely happen in real life.

The ending is ingenious, and it's possible that Benedict has brought to life the most plausible explanation for why Christie disappeared for 11 days in 1926.""‚ÄîThe Washington PostThe New York Times and USA Today bestselling author of The Only Woman in the Room returns with a thrilling reconstruction of one of the most notorious events in literary history: Agatha Christie's mysterious 11-day disappearance in 1926.In December 1926, Agatha Christie goes missing. Investigators find her empty car on the edge of a deep, gloomy pond, the only clues some tire tracks nearby and a fur coat left in the car‚Äîstrange for a frigid night. Her World War I veteran husband and her daughter have no knowledge of her whereabouts, and England unleashes an unprecedented manhunt to find the up-and-coming mystery author. Eleven days later, she reappears, just as mysteriously as she disappeared, claiming amnesia and providing no explanations for her time away.The puzzle of those missing eleven days has persisted. With her trademark historical fiction exploration into the shadows of the past, acclaimed author Marie Benedict brings us into the world of Agatha Christie, imagining why such a brilliant woman would find herself at the center of such murky historical mysteries.What is real, and what is mystery? What role did her unfaithful husband play, and what was he not telling investigators?Agatha Christie novels have withstood the test of time, due in no small part to Christie's masterful storytelling and clever mind that may never be matched, but Agatha Christie's untold history offers perhaps her greatest mystery of all.Fans of The Secrets We Kept, The Lions of Fifth Avenue, and The Alice Network will enjoy this riveting saga of literary history, suspense, and love gone wrong.Also By Marie Benedict:The Other EinsteinCarnegie's MaidThe Only Woman in the RoomLady Clementine  Read more  ","['5.0 out of 5 stars', '2.0 out of 5 stars', '4.0 out of 5 stars', '2.0 out of 5 stars']","['\nWritten in the vein of Agatha Christie\n', '\nDisappointing\n', '\nImmersive, mysterious, and intriguing!\n', '\nA disappointment\n']","[""\n\n  Marie Benedict has created quite a following of faithful readers by tackling various unjustly neglected, but prominent women of history and science, such as Hedy Lamar, Einstein's wife Mitza Maric, and Clementine Churchill. Now she deals with the most famous author of classic murder mysteries : Agatha Christie, whose personal life proves to have been a mystery in itself. Benedict always relies on a basis of methodical research and then adds to that her own intuition and writing talent to present us with an extremely engaging result: a book hard to put down. This latest novel is written according to the plot design used successfully by Agatha Christie herself, and in this case the cleverly devised plot with its surprising twists and turns makes us doubt and wonder to the very last page. It is a stylistic triumph and a very good read!\n\n"", '\n\n  It read like a pre-teen novel and was super corny. Only made it 70% through and gave up.\n\n', '\n\n  The Mystery of Mrs. Christie is a captivating, colourful interpretation that sweeps you away to England in the early 1900s and into the life of Agatha Christie, from her courtship by Lieutenant Christie to wifehood, motherhood, authorship, and the subsequent investigation into the unaccountable eleven days in 1926 that she was missing.The prose is eloquent and expressive. The characters are well-drawn, complex, and authentic. And the plot, alternating between a Chrisite manuscript detailing her life and her husband‚Äôs actions and motivations following her disappearance, is an absorbing tale of life, loss, loneliness, loyalty, aspirations, heartache, retribution, and infidelity.Overall, The Mystery of Mrs. Christie is a vivid, compelling, pensive novel by Benedict that does an exceptional job of highlighting her considerable knowledge and impressive research into this renowned literature figures life as well as a dramatic, somewhat plausible explanation for her still unexplainable disappearance all those years ago.\n\n', '\n\n  Ok. Here is the thing, since this book has been endorsed by Kate Quinn, Lisa Wingate and Stuart Turton and that there are lots of fans of this book, I promise to be very brief.This one failed me at every level.See, that says all.But please, do not let me stop you from reading. Perhaps I‚Äôm just a cranky old man (or getting there).Happy reading!Spoiler Alert: there is a single mention of The Murder of Roger Ackroyd where the author reveals the murderer. In my opinion she murdered the book.\n\n']"

Even with that effort, there are unexpected twists and turns. I really enjoyed that process.As well I am pleased to read a Canadian author that did not shy away from portraying the Quebecois - L'englais perspective accurately.I recommend this reading experience especially to those who would enjoy a good mystery. On to Book #2.\n\n"", '\n\n  I enjoyed the characters in this book for the most part. The writing seemed a little confusing at first, but then improved somewhat. I will read the next book. I liked that it was not extremely obvious who the murderer was.  I did not feel the character of Yvette Nichol made sense as far as the incompleteness of her interactions with Inspector Gamache. Maybe this will continue in other books. I will read the next and see.  I have yet to determine how a bunch of stick figures in a picture were so recognizable. Did not really make much sense to me.\n\n', '\n\n  Having read some of the other Gamache books and just finished his latest (Kingdom of the Bling), I decided it was time to read the first book - Still Life. Everything is there already - the characters with all their foibles, the village of Three Pines, the insights and analyses, the love and support of a community. And of course the story and the tension and inability to put this down, because you just get drawn into the mystery and drama. A wonderful book - and it doesn‚Äôt have to be the first one you read. After all, it‚Äôs a Gamache novel! üòÄ\n\n', '\n\n  My first read. I had to reread the first chapter  3 times as I found it confusing but then it became fluid. A great writer. Born and raised in the Eastern Townships and working in Outremont I had to pretend this was just a fiction since I‚Äôm familiar with la rue St Denis not  boulevard and my French is fluent so tried to ignore spelling. Penny‚Äôs writing is very involved much like British mystery novelist.  I will certainly read all her series .  Chapeau!!\n\n', '\n\n  Given the good reviews this book has received, I am a minority. It is the first book by this author and it shows. Overall it is like Hercule Poirot meets a bunch of amateur artists in a Norman Rockwell setting.It was somewhat entertaining, but not a page turner for me. Too many annoyances on the way.Starting with the plot. Someone dies, a friend suspects foul play. Instead of calling the cops, she puts a clue into a  painting, shows it to all her friends, one being the murderer, and says that there is a message in the painting. Of course the murderer figures that she suspects and kills her. Then Detective Gamache comes with his team to investigate. Turns out that another painter lady figures out the events and the identity of the murderer before Gamache, so he is eventually required to save her from similar fate.Annoyances abound. First the author overuses metaphors an similes to create interest. To wit, second paragraph of the book:"" ..knelt down, his knees cracking like the report of a hunter\'s rifle"". Two pages later, an editorial aside:"" Every year the hunters shot cows and horses and family pets and each other. And, unbelievably, they sometimes shot themselves, perhaps in a psychotic episode where they mistook themselves for dinner""Yikes - as they sat in French: ""tir√©e par les cheveux"". The lady obviously does not abide hunting.The premise that a amateur painter would cover the interior walls of her house with murals of the village life is just unbelievably weird, and an unnecessary distraction. So is Det. Gamache\'s interaction with young Agent Nichol, not at all fully developed. Why bother?What I missed the most, was the vision of the village itself. Did not get any sense what it was like geographically, nor architecturally,nor of the overall population. Usually stories benefit from such vision, and also from a sense of the atmosphere of the place, also lacking.I am soon going to read her eighth novel, The Beautiful Mystery, hoping to see progress commensurate with her reputation.BTW, I am wondering what were the editors doing to eliminate the first- book clangers?In the meantime I am reading a mystery by Martin Cruz Smith, who can create scenes from faraway places, with local atmosphere, and compelling characters, from the first page onward . Just as Elizabeth George does. Just sayin\'.\n\n', ""\n\n  I have long heard about Louise Penny, the author who lives in the Eastern Townships not too far from where my mother used to live. After someone recommended that I start with this, the first book, I bought and read  it in a couple of days in August. It's brilliant. I especially love the writing style. As a poet, I find that Ruth's poetry, occasionally and poignantly incorporated into the novel, works incredibly well. Of course, it's a detective and mystery story, and the plot is well crafted, the characters brilliantly developed, and Armand presented as a stable figure, the backbone of these stories. Since August, I have bought and read more in the series.\n\n"", '\n\n  Decided to start the series at the beginning and this one did make me want more.  Gamache was well enough established to make me care about what happened to him.  He seems much like Donna de Leon\'s Brunetti -- a moderately successful middle-aged policeman with enough personal conviction to give him occasional doubts.  Other characters were sketched with fairly broad strokes but when I encounter them again I\'ll recognize them.The ""mystery"" wasn\'t very mysterious, but the supporting cast of suspects, witnesses and groupies was inteeresting enough to make it worth waiting for the Surete to figure it out.  Looking forward to the next one.\n\n', '\n\n  Depuis son passage √† l\'√©mission dominicale ""Tout le monde en parle"", j\'ai √©t√© intrigu√© par Louise Penny.

All of that was as on point as possible. For me, though, there was simply too much angst in this book. ‚ÄúDr. Dick‚Äù really did come across as a dick sometimes. I also often didn‚Äôt like the way Lynsey and Josh treated each other. If someone I were involved with treated me the way they periodically treated each other, I would have been very unimpressed.In the end, I think it comes down to preference. As I said, the book is very well written and likely to appeal to many. I just don‚Äôt love tropes that involve people who behave badly (even if it‚Äôs due to past trauma) or ones in which people are super attracted to each other, while seeming to actively dislike each other. I don‚Äôt go for anything in the ‚Äúhate sex‚Äù sphere. I just can‚Äôt get my head around attraction that doesn‚Äôt involve at least some element of like and/or respect for the other person.Despite my own lack of love for this book, hats off to Amy Daws for exploring something new.

RH are those romance tropes that are either done really well or are books that contain a lot of group activities but no decent plot. The Boys of Briar Hall is a RH series that has been done really well. The second book answered some of my questions from the first book‚Ä¶but left me with a lot more questions than answers.Ava Jade is a really well written female heroine. I love it when authors write RH and the female is a force to be reckoned with. Ava Jade is a take no prisoners type of female. She is not going to sit around and let these men dictate what she can and cannot do. Stealing the door knobs had to have been one of the best comically written scenes in a RH that I‚Äôve ever read. This female is not someone to be messed with.There is a lot of action packed chapters. This story is not a slow burn. From the very first book, the author is taking us along for a ride and we‚Äôre just doing our best to hold on for dear life. Absolutely fantastic book. Cannot wait for the next one.I was provided an advanced reader copy in exchange for an honest review.\n\n', '\n\n  This is one excellent RH read. Ava Jade is a total BA and I want to be her friend! Rook is my #1 but Grey is also awesome and Corvus has his moments. The storyline is action packed and suspense filled with pockets of spice. I am so eager for the next book.\n\n', ""\n\n  I will not be reading the last one. It's very disappointing what happens in the end. Not to mention how difficult Ava is through 8ut the whole book  making mountains out of mole hills.Nobody likes a snitch.\n\n"", '\n\n  What an intense roller coaster ride!  Ava Jade is fierce and untrusting. Can she find a way to fix everything. That ending  though‚Ä¶.. wow‚Ä¶ can‚Äôt wait for the next book. Great series!\n\n', '\n\n  Oh my mother tucking duck....this is an amazing read the story flow is fabulos and I could. Not put it down!!\n\n', '\n\n  I love the characters and her strength. definitely recommend this read. I look forward to finding out more about each character.\n\n', '\n\n  ‚ÄúShe was the ember that would ignite us, spurring us into a forest fire that would eat all our enemies away, rendering them to ashes.  We would burn together. She was the catalyst we‚Äôd been waiting for.‚ÄùOMG! Hold on tight because this story is about to blow you away and take you on one hell of a twisted ride of bloody violence and spicy deliciousness! I was riveted to my seat, biting my nails with anticipation and curling my toes from all of the raw desire in every chapter. I never wanted this story to end but when it did OMFG that  ending sucker punched me in the face!Ava Jade is one hell of a MF badass! She is so damn fierce, slightly unhinged and utterly uncontrollable. I love everything about her! The connection that she is slowly forging with the Crows is intense but fragile and could break at any moment. The desire and burning passion that is growing between all of them will have your toes curling and your panties combusting with its intensity and heat! These four are perfect for each other but they all have darkness and demons that they need to destroy in order for Ava Jade to make it past the trials in one piece.There are so many secrets, betrayals and twisted moments throughout that will leave you wondering how this is all going to turn out in the end. It‚Äôs one wild rollercoaster ride.This is a well written story with deliciously dark and damaged characters, gut-wrenching emotional moments, twists and turns that will shock you, and an ending that will leave you begging to know what happens next!Highly recommend for all dark romance lovers.\n\n', '\n\n  Picking up where book 1 ended, we are thrust right back into the story. There was a lot more information given and many questions from book one were finally answered. Although there was no shortage of questions after this book.I loved that we began to see the interactions between AJ and the boys change. I felt this book was more about their changing relationships and getting to know them more than moving forward with the plot. There were some new plot points but it was slower than book 1. This didn‚Äôt make the book less interesting, it actually made the story developments that occurred mean more.That ending left me needing to know how book 3 will continue the story. It wasn‚Äôt really a cliffhanger, more of a ‚Äúoh this is going to be good.‚Äù\n\n']"

If only that was all she wanted.Later, when Joy goes missing, and Savannah is nowhere to be found, the police question the one person who remains: Stan. But for someone who claims to be innocent, he, like many spouses, seems to have a lot to hide.

Brilliant and quite sly.\n\n', '\n\n  Remarkable storytelling! Liane‚Äôs  ability to weave even the smallest detail into the story in a brilliant way is an incredible feat.

There was so much of this book referenced around tennis (which I could honestly could care less about). Also, the last like 50 pages were completely unnecessary and added nothing to the story or ending. This book was just okay for me, not great but not totally terrible.\n\n"", ""\n\n  Such simple stories yet so compelling; love Liane's work.

I felt like the same thing kept happening, Eliana running away, Eliana being kidnapped, Rielle being moody, Rielle torn between Audric and Corien. Over and over. Like I didn‚Äôt need multiple love scenes to demonstrate their feelings. I feel like this book could have been half the length or the story could have progressed further. It was a meh for me. I do want to see how it all wraps up given the twist at the end which wasn‚Äôt terribly shocking... we‚Äôve been set up for it for sometime. I guess we‚Äôll see in October how it comes together. Hopefully with a better flow.\n\n', ""\n\n  HO. LY. SH*T. I have so many emotions, so many questions, so much chaos in my head right now thanks to this book. I knew full well it would be a roller coaster and end on an epic cliffhanger, as all second books in trilogies do. But I was not prepared for THIS.Let me preface that this is a heavy read. Not just in that the book itself is physically heavy, but it it is emotionally heavy and will leave you worn out. It deals with some rough subjects and while they were handled with care, some moments made me deeply uncomfortable, though they added to the story itself.And what a story it was. Packed with the action and passion I expected, and so filled with twists and turns I thought my brain was going to get whiplash (it probably does have emotional whiplash because I haven't fully processed the ending and refuse to accept certain aspects). It is actually killing me not to discuss the ending in the review, because let's just say the game has changed.The action scenes were intense, explosive, and filled with artistic flourish. The romance and relationships between various characters were among the highlights for me. This definitely caused problems for Rielle, since I swear she had four romances going on at one point. While her story was definitely the most emotional and romantic of the two, I was more hooked on Eliana's story. It progressed amazingly, and the way it ended will leave me haunted for a while. I am seriously not prepared for the finale.FURYBORN swept me off my feet, but KINGSBANE has left me breathless. It's dark, unforgiving, heart-wrenching, and scandalously steamy (seriously, there is so much sex in this book), and I wouldn't have it any other way. Absolutely one of my favourite books of 2019 and a must read for all YA Fantasy and  adult fantasy.\n\n"", '\n\n  Kingsbane is an intricate, complex story set in a detailed world. It demands a lot from the reader but is equally rewarding. It is emotionally involving and often devastating. There is some ambiguity and uncertainty with both the ‚Äúgood‚Äù guys and the ‚Äúbad‚Äù guys being capable of great brutality and deception. Even at the end of this second book I‚Äôm not completely sure that I know which side is good and which is evil.From the very first chapter of book one in this series, Furyborn, we know that Rielle is going to turn evil and destroy the world. Seeing her as a fairly innocent teen it was hard to imagine how this was possible. Through the first book we began to see glimmers of the mad queen but this comes to a head in Kingsbane. Piece by piece we witness her descent into evil and madness and by the time she throws in completely with the angels it makes perfect sense for her character. Her arrogance and megalomania grow in line with her power and by the time she goes full on mad queen it is no surprise. I even felt a little bit sad for her as everyone she cares about turns their back on her due to her inability to control her great power and anger which leads her to horrific behaviour. Her eventual ‚Äúsnapping‚Äù is completely understandable. Awful and disappointing but understandable.Similar to in Furyborn the perspective shifts with each chapter, mostly between Rielle and Eliana, who are separated by 1000 years. While I didn‚Äôt find this confusing at all in book one I was ill while reading much of Kingsbane and I found it difficult to follow and keep the two story lines straight, especially after they begin to cross over . Once I was recovered it was not a problem. This was a case of ‚Äúit‚Äôs me not you‚Äù and I don‚Äôt think that this is an issue with the book itself but be aware that this is two complex stories in one and you need to be on your mental game.The end of Kingsbane is a serious cliff-hanger for both story lines. Eliana‚Äôs story had a particularly cruel end and it will be excruciating to wait for the next book. I think I know what happened to cause this huge, terrible ending and I don‚Äôt know if it can be redeemed or reversed but I‚Äôm sure hoping it can! This whole time travel aspect has blown my mind and apparently the ‚Äúbutterfly effect‚Äù is seriously powerful. I‚Äôm hoping it can be harnessed for good in the next book. It‚Äôs going to be a long, painful wait!Thank you to Sourcebooks Fire for providing an Electronic Advance Reader Copy via NetGalley for review.\n\n']"

Once in chapter 10 and then again in chapter 15 when speaking about the character Levi , the name Tate was written.

Love this book!\n']","[""\n\n  This was an exciting, thrill-packed Cold War thriller. Its author, Chris Hadfield, imparts his extraordinary knowledge and experience, bringing atmosphere, authenticity, and credibility to the plot. The gripping, action-packed story is infused with science, technology, politics, espionage, space history, murder, and intrigue with vividly drawn believable characters. Author, Chris Hadfield, is a much-decorated Canadian astronaut, a former fighter pilot, engineer,  spacewalker, served in both the American and Russian space programs, and Commander of the International Space Station. Readers who have not followed the history of the Apollo space program and the space stations may recognize Hatfield may recognize him from the video where he played guitar and sang David Bowie's Space Oddity while floating in 0 Gravity in the ISS. This was featured in news reports at the time and can still be viewed on YouTube. He was active in the space program from 1992 until 2013. I find it difficult to categorize this action-packed novel. This is not so much in the science fiction genre but a historical and suspenseful journey into an alternate past involving a fictional journey of Apollo 18 in 1973. The Apollo program actually ended with Apollo 17, but the story imagines what happens on a subsequent mission to the moon. The writing is filled with an overload of scientific detail and technical descriptions that will appeal more to the space enthusiast than to the casual reader of thrillers. However, the story is so suspenseful, intense, action-packed, and cinematic within a plausible, realistic storyline that it should keep most readers entranced. A leading character is Kaz Zemeckis, a flight controller at Houston. He is assigned to oversee the mission of three astronauts to the moon and ensure their safety from Mission Control.  Kaz missed his goal for going into space when he lost an eye in a training accident. Shortly before blast-off, the astronaut in charge dies in an accident, or was it accidental? The leading backup astronaut replaces him. One astronaut is to stay in the vehicle, circle the moon, and await the two walking on the moon's surface. Due to unfortunate circumstances, this will not be the two originally assigned to the task. At the last minute, the scientific exploration is hastily changed into a military one. The Russians have placed a high-resolution spy satellite in orbit and also a moon rover looking for valuable minerals on the surface.  The astronauts are now ordered to disable both items in order to keep the Russians from advancing in the space race. Kaz is suspicious that one of the astronauts is not what he pretends to be. Surrounding him in Mission Control are many real characters whose names I recognized from the past. Also, at the White House are actual historical people, all seamlessly blended into the story. At the end of the book, I was surprised that most of the characters, except for the fictional Kaz, were real people, and the Russian spy satellite and their moon rover were actually in place at the time. In the high-tension storyline, there are startling encounters, dangers galore from the Russians, and one aboard Apollo 18 may be a murderer. Events do not go as planned, and both the Russians and the Americans are determined to retrieve an exotic, rare mineral from the moon. The Russians are angry that Apollo 18 is trying to disable their space equipment. Back at Mission Control, the sheriff and others are helping Kaz investigate the astronaut's backgrounds and try to keep on top of the changing events in space. What will the outcome be? Will the crew of Apollo 18 succeed in their mission and get home safely? Recommended to those who want adventure, history of early space exploration and moon landings, espionage, and find the technical details enhance the reality of this dramatic story. I was glued to the pages, except for a short break to watch Captain Kirk returning from space in Jeff Bezos's space vehicle.\n\n"", '\n\n  Purchased an early pre-order which was supposed to be signed by the author. Just got my book and it‚Äôs a regular version, not signed.\n\n', ""\n\n  When I lived in Russia [Moscow] for three years from 2001 to 2004, I ,  a Canadian woman, was briefy a member of CWIM - Canadian Women in Moscow - which was hosted by Mrs Hadfield. [I went on to host a year of International Women's Club at my downtown flat in 2002-2003]. I also briefly saw Commander Hadfield at a hotel 'do', though I was, of course, not yet aware of his near future importance in international developments in space.Because of my admittedly small increased awareness of his activities, I looked forward to buying a copy of Commander Hadfield's novel, 'The Apollo Murders'. I tried to read through the book, but had to stop halfway, enmired in technical detail but not finding much by the way of character and plot development. I cannot recommend the novel.\n\n"", '\n\n  This book was good interweaving of fact and fiction, by an author who actually lived a number of the adventures described.  Only drawback I thought was the minimal depth of character of the sole female in this story (a cosmonaut).  I hope Chris Hadfield considers writing more fiction!\n\n', '\n\n  I have  seen Chris Hadfield on TV many times and have been  impressed by his remarkable skill set. I did wonder however how he would do as a writer of fiction. I was very much impressed with ""The Apollo Murders"" and his attention to detail in describing the workings of a space craft and the ins and outs of day to day life working for NASA. The book unwinds at a very nice pace and as we get to know the main characters we feel part of the myriad of decisions being made on the Apollo  spacecraft and back at Houston. I also loved the Russian connection within the plot and even the fact that not everything works out for the Americans. If I had one criticism it would be to include a few more dangerous adventures/episodes throughout the book even if it meant including less detail about space. I felt I was turning the pages at times waiting for the ""shoe to drop"" only to be teased along until we got to the point the craft was ready to leave the moon and the gun shot was fired. Having said all this I would recommend the book to anyone and look forward to his next effort.\n\n', ""\n\n  Sorry, I didn't make it to the end before beginning another book. It got a bit too technical for me but those into flight etc will love it. I intend to pick it up again because it fascinated me. Have never before realized the complicated machinery and electronics that are involved for one in flight. The author's writing is perfectly executed but writing a mystery involves a rather more taut and direct line from  start to  finish. Doing a mystery novel is not rocket science.\n\n"", '\n\n  This is a real page turner that will appeal to fans of political thrillers and space. Chris Hadfield takes the reader back to the moon landings and the Cold War. Through the characters the reader experience what it‚Äôs like to be an astronaut. A great book! I hope there are more novels on the way.\n\n', '\n\n  So well written I hated to put it down. I loved that he shared his fantastic knowledge with us in an interesting way. I will absolutely be buying his other books too. Hopefully he will be as prolific as Steven King.\n\n']"

  A New York Times Notable Book, a Barack Obama favorite, selected as a Top 10 Book of the Year by Fresh Air, Time, and Entertainment Weekly, and a Best Book of the Year by Goodreads Choice Awards, the Associated Press, and many more ‚ÄúIf you‚Äôre looking for a superb novel, look no further.‚Äù ‚ÄîThe Washington Post  The instant New York Times bestseller and finalist for the 2021 National Book Award is ‚Äúwildly inventive, a humane and uplifting book for adults that‚Äôs infused with the magic of childhood reading experiences‚Äù (The New York Times Book Review).  From the Pulitzer Prize‚Äìwinning author of All the Light We Cannot See, perhaps the most bestselling and beloved literary fiction of our time, comes Cloud Cuckoo Land.Set in Constantinople in the fifteenth century, in a small town in present-day Idaho, and on an interstellar ship decades from now, Anthony Doerr‚Äôs gorgeous third novel is a triumph of imagination and compassion, a soaring story about children on the cusp of adulthood in worlds in peril, who find resilience, hope‚Äîand a book. In Cloud Cuckoo Land, Doerr has created a magnificent tapestry of times and places that reflects our vast interconnectedness‚Äîwith other species, with each other, with those who lived before us, and with those who will be here after we‚Äôre gone.  Thirteen-year-old Anna, an orphan, lives inside the formidable walls of Constantinople in a house of women who make their living embroidering the robes of priests. Restless, insatiably curious, Anna learns to read, and in this ancient city, famous for its libraries, she finds a book, the story of Aethon, who longs to be turned into a bird so that he can fly to a utopian paradise in the sky. This she reads to her ailing sister as the walls of the only place she has known are bombarded in the great siege of Constantinople. Outside the walls is Omeir, a village boy, miles from home, conscripted with his beloved oxen into the invading army. His path and Anna‚Äôs will cross.  Five hundred years later, in a library in Idaho, octogenarian Zeno, who learned Greek as a prisoner of war, rehearses five children in a play adaptation of Aethon‚Äôs story, preserved against all odds through centuries. Tucked among the library shelves is a bomb, planted by a troubled, idealistic teenager, Seymour. This is another siege. And in a not-so-distant future, on the interstellar ship Argos, Konstance is alone in a vault, copying on scraps of sacking the story of Aethon, told to her by her father. She has never set foot on our planet.  Like Marie-Laure and Werner in All the Light We Cannot See, Anna, Omeir, Seymour, Zeno, and Konstance are dreamers and outsiders who find resourcefulness and hope in the midst of gravest danger. Their lives are gloriously intertwined. Doerr‚Äôs dazzling imagination transports us to worlds so dramatic and immersive that we forget, for a time, our own. Dedicated to ‚Äúthe librarians then, now, and in the years to come,‚Äù Cloud Cuckoo Land is a beautiful and redemptive novel about stewardship‚Äîof the book, of the Earth, of the human heart. From the National Book Award finalist citation: ‚ÄúFrom the 15th century to the future, the five protagonists in Anthony Doerr‚Äôs brilliant Cloud Cuckoo Land come together astonishingly in the stories they make of their lives, rewritten by time and circumstance. This marvelous book is like an astrolabe or an armillary sphere; a navigation instrument engineered to discover the world.

It‚Äôs a remarkable story and an extraordinary achievement by Anthony Doerr\n\n', '\n\n  I gave up after 80 pages\n\n', '\n\n  Very different novel! But very entertaining\n\n', '\n\n  First of all, this book is meant to be savoured, not devoured. At 650 pages, it‚Äôs better enjoyed in small bites over a long period much like a multicourse Italian family dinner. Doerr is not serving up McDonald‚Äôs fast food. Much like the importance of heading to a big dinner with an appetite, empty your head of all preconceived ideas and learn to go with the flow while appreciating Doerr‚Äôs talent. Accept what is being presented, knowing that ALL the pieces will tie together and make sense later. Frustration awaits if you ignore the suggestions!At the core of this book is the concept of stewardship ‚Äì of books, of the planet, and of each other‚Äôs heart. To showcase this concept, Doerr will transport you to 15th century Constantinople with Anna and Omeir, to Idaho in the present time with Seymour and Zeno, and to a foreign future with Konstance. All five dreamers on the edge of society are trying to make sense of the world around them and, as a result, come to rely on their resourcefulness and hope. Doerr showcases the power of a story through the ages as each come in contact with and are united by the fictional ancient manuscript, Cloud Cuckoo Land, by Antonius Diogenes.This Herculean effort, 7 years in the writing, spans three narratives and thousands of years. Written to remind us of the importance of stories and their power to unite, this literary wonder needs to be on your radar. Put yourself in the right frame of mind and look up the definition of the title before allowing Doerr to sweep you away!I was generously gifted this advance copy by Anthony Doerr, Simon and Schuster Canada and NetGalley and was under no obligation to provide a review.\n\n', ""\n\n  I ended this book with a sigh and a silence - wow! What a masterpiece! How can I describe the impressions that chased each other throughout my experiencing this book?The varying timeliness and different protagonists lent the nature of a vibrant kaleidoscope to this novel. The present tense used by Doerr, and which mostly doesn't work towards my reading pleasure, was in this instance transformed to the opposite. It gave an urgency to the actions, a depth to feelings never named but vividly transmitted to the reader. The prose is unorthodox and immensely captivating. Thus, I cried for and with Omeir (my favourite character) and deeply empathised with Seymour and his almost palpable pain and rage. I was saddened by Zeno who played it safe for most of his life and almost escaped living that way - almost... I cheered on Konstance's sleuthing in her desperate attempt to save herself from despair. I felt deeply for little Anna whose determined search for knowledge and desperate, courageous attempts to help led to disaster and also to some miracles. Their anxieties and fears became mine, as did their triumphs. And the world and life truly are Janus-faced, beautiful and terrible at once.I enjoyed this book slowly, savouring it, in spite of my intense urge to read on, just a little more, just one more chapter. I will read it again, even more slowly, and I am sure that I'll discover even more then.This is a must read, not a recommendation, but an urging.My sincere thanks to Scribner for this compelling eARC; the opinions in this review are my own.\n\n""]"

  A New York Times, USA Today, Wall Street Journal, and Amazon Charts Bestseller!For fans of Hidden Figures, comes the incredible true story of the women heroes who were exposed to radium in factories across the U.S. in the early 20th century, and their brave and groundbreaking battle to strengthen workers' rights, even as the fatal poison claimed their own lives...In the dark years of the First World War, radium makes gleaming headlines across the nation as the fresh face of beauty, and wonder drug of the medical community. From body lotion to tonic water, the popular new element shines bright. Meanwhile, hundreds of girls toil amidst the glowing dust of the radium-dial factories. The glittering chemical covers their bodies from head to toe; they light up the night like industrious fireflies. With such a coveted job, these ""shining girls"" are the luckiest alive ‚Äî until they begin to fall mysteriously ill. And, until they begin to come forward.As the women start to speak out on the corruption, the factories that once offered golden opportunities ignore all claims of the gruesome side effects. And as the fatal poison of the radium takes hold, the brave shining girls find themselves embroiled in one of the biggest scandals of America's early 20th century, and in a groundbreaking battle for workers' rights that will echo for centuries to come. A timely story of corporate greed and the brave figures that stood up to fight for their lives, these women and their voices will shine for years to come.Written with a sparkling voice and breakneck pace, The Radium Girls fully illuminates the inspiring young women exposed to the ""wonder"" substance of radium, and their awe-inspiring strength in the face of almost impossible circumstances. Their courage and tenacity led to life-changing regulations, research into nuclear bombing, and ultimately saved hundreds of thousands of lives...

It is well researched and based on facts but the stories of the women dial painters was presented from a very personal point of view and brought to the forefront the true scope of this catastrophe for them and for their families.  It is hard to imagine how much courage they had to fight the ""corrupt corporation""  to acknowledge the reality of radium poisoning as a disease that exhibits itself in many ways.  The few dentists, doctors and lawyers who tried to help, were up against a ""well-oiled"" team of corporate managers, lawyers and doctors who were on the company payroll and spread their lies to the employees and the public.  This is such an important story and so many of the Occupational Health & Safety workplace guidelines that are now in place today began with the fight of these desperate and courageous women who were denied safety in their workplace.\n\n', '\n\n  This book was heartbreaking. The true story of the girls who painted radium pieces for dials, clocks and watches during WWI, the 20s and 30s. Many of them were very young when they started (as young as 13!) Most of them died young as well. The suffering they endured was unbearable and the battle they fought was incredible. Their story resonates through to today, with occupational health and safety legislation becoming more comprehensive as a result of their battle and sacrifice.Beyond the health and safety aspect, the experuence of these unfortunate women illustrates other issues as well - the gender disparity (if they were men, the problem would have been addressed much more quickly), the plight of the working poor, the lack of affordable medical care, and the callousness of the industrial employers.This book was well written, extremely well annotated, and, I suggest, very comprehensive.  I highly recommend it.\n\n', '\n\n  I remember growing up in the 1940s and 1950s, the radium dial watches we all used to wear and the radium dial clocks we all had in our houses and we just took this for granted and then all of a sudden we didn‚Äôt have them anymore. It wasn‚Äôt till about 10 years ago that I looked up on Wikipedia as to what happened and then realized the thing about radioactivity. I didn‚Äôt really think they use real radium in the watches and lo and behold they did! The story about how  The radium corporation and government branches ignored the information in this included the American medical Association for years and years is quite amazing! And quite angering. Once again, society and man ignored the women‚Äôs complaints and resolutions. Wonderful read\n\n', ""\n\n  I had only a vague knowledge about the subject of these girls.Its an absorbing and painful read how thesewomen suffered and how barely no one was listening and came to their defense until it was much too late.The writer has done her research and the women's stories are presented in a very engaging way.So much ignorance and harm was dealt these women...radium being hailed as a 'wonder drug' to manyailments in those days  is shocking indeed!A page turner and highly recommended.\n\n"", ""\n\n  This is simply the most amazing story I have ever read,and it's TRUE! I could not put this book down. Right from the beginning the author brought me into the lives of these girls who became victims of one of the most horrendous crimes of the century.....but they triumphed for humanity at great personal cost. These women are heroes! Bravo!!!\n\n"", '\n\n  What an amazing story this book holds. What this girls suffered through and fought against is unbelievable. They changed industry safety and scientific knowledge of radiation and we should all be grateful to them. Easy 5 stars, although not easy to read about their suffering.\n\n', '\n\n  Absolutely fascinating account of big business vs. the little guy. Set in a time when women were considered disposable commodities by employers and their concerns for their safety ""hysterical reactions"". Tells it from the women\'s point of view in an age where women didn\'t count.\n\n', '\n\n  I would. Recommend this book to everyone who enjoys reading.  It has taken me longer to get through this book as I had to go back and read some of it over again The terrible pain these women went through was just a horror and their employers were absolute beasts and liars.I am very pleased that there is a memorial to these women,they deserve it.\n\n']"

  From the acclaimed award-winning author Emmanuel Carr√®re, Lives Other Than My Own: A Memoir is an act of generous imagination that unflinchingly records devastating loss and, equally vividly, the wealth of human solace that follows in its wake.Selected by the New York Times as one of the 50 Best Memoirs of the Past 50 YearsIn Sri Lanka, a tsunami sweeps a child out to sea, her grand-father helpless against the onrushing water. In France, a young woman succumbs to illness, leaving her husband and small children bereft. Present at both events, Emmanuel Carr√®re sets out to tell the story of two families‚Äîshattered and ultimately restored. What he accomplishes is nothing short of a literary miracle: a heartrending narrative of endless love, a meditation on courage and decency in the face of adversity, an intimate and reverent look at the extraordinary beauty and nobility of ordinary lives.Precise, sober, and suspenseful, as full of twists and turns as any novel, Lives Other Than My Own confronts terrifying catastrophes to illuminate the astonishing richness of human connection: a grandfather who thought he had found paradise‚Äîtoo soon‚Äîand now devotes himself to helping his neighbors rebuild their village; a husband so in love with his ailing wife that he carries her in his arms like a knight does his princess; and finally, Carr√®re himself, longtime chronicler of the tormented self, who unexpectedly finds consolation and even joy as he immerses himself in the lives of others.‚ÄúMoving‚Ä¶Carr√®re‚Äôs prose is precise and measured‚Ä¶Through interviews with friends and relatives of both families, he creates powerful portraits that celebrate ordinary lives.‚Äù‚ÄîThe New Yorker‚ÄúYou begin this memoir thinking it will be about one thing, and it turns into something else altogether‚Äîa book at once more ordinary and more extraordinary than any first impressions might allow.‚Äù‚ÄîThe New York Times  Read more  ","['5.0 out of 5 stars', '1.0 out of 5 stars', '4.0 out of 5 stars']","['\nBeautiful and Originally written\n', '\nUnpleasant experience.\n', '\nresilience after loss\n']","['\n\n  Probably one of the most beautifully-crafted yet unselfconscious memoirs I have ever read.

This was a girl who strapped herself with weapons to go for a run who gets flustered around men. I also didn't like how every time she had a moment of PTSD just she assumed the brothers would want to cut her out of their lives. At the beginning it was understandable but towards the end it became repetitive and a bit annoying.I think that the first book was a lot of world building.

I really enjoyed it and am back on board with this series.The same cast of characters is present, Kay, her Secret Service forensic psychologist husband Benton, her niece Lucy and my personal favorite - Pete Marino. The relationship between Kay and Marino was contentious in the beginning of the series, but I\'m happy with where Cornwell has taken Marino in this latest. He\'s a valuable resource instead of being portrayed as a thorn in her side. However there is a new thorn in the side character. Kay has inherited a secretary who is loyal to her old boss and quite resentful of Kay. Kay has the same analytical mind. Cornwell keeps the characters moving forward in real time, with the successes and sadness that living life brings.The \'back to basics\' has Kay investigating the death of a young woman found on the railroad tracks. This crime very much reminded me of the earlier books. Political machinations and corruption abounds at a number of levels in this latest, stretching as far as outer space! Kay is called in to examine a remote site. There\'s yet another thread that I\'ll let you discover.I chose to listen to this latest. The reader was award winning narrator Susan Ericksen. She has read previous Scarpetta books, so the continuity is nice. Her voice is perfect for the mental image I\'ve created for Scarpetta. Her diction is clear, easy to understand, well enunciated and pleasant. The speed of speaking was a bit slow for me, so I sped things up two notches, using the speed adjuster on my device. She provides different voices for the characters, each easily identifiable. Ericksen conveys the emotions of the characters and the action and suspense of the plot with her voice. A great performance.I did find the ending a bit rushed and a slightly too pat, but I quite enjoyed this \'relaunch\' of this series. The door has been left open for number 26 - and I for one will be picking it up.\n\n', '\n\n  I‚Äôve read all the Kay Scarpetta books and enjoyed all of them. This one was ok‚Ä¶.I‚Äôm glad I read it but was disappointed with a few aspects. The part involving the space murders was awkward and really was completely unrelated to the rest of the plot. The idea that an autopsy could be done in that way was a bit science fiction. I‚Äôm glad Marino was back and not portrayed like an incompetent fool. The ending was very anti climactic. I was expecting a bigger mystery to be solved. More focus on her job and the solving of suspicious deaths makes for a better story line.\n\n']"

Since its publication in France in 1942, Camus‚Äôs novel has been translated into sixty languages and sold more than six million copies. It‚Äôs the rare novel that‚Äôs as likely to be found in a teen‚Äôs backpack as in a graduate philosophy seminar. If the twentieth century produced a novel that could be called ubiquitous, The Stranger is it. ¬† How did a young man in his twenties who had never written a novel turn out a masterpiece that still grips readers more than seventy years later? With Looking for The Stranger, Alice Kaplan tells that story.

What did Vonnegut do after Slaughterhouse Five, his iconic masterpiece set in wartime Dresden? He produced book after book, all as good if not better than Slaughterhouse Five. He did not let the success of Slaughterhouse Five damper his creative energy. In Mandel‚Äôs case, Station Eleven, her fourth novel, was a blockbuster, translated into thirty-five languages. How could she top that success? Wasn‚Äôt Station Eleven the pinnacle of success for Mandel? It appears not. Like Vonnegut, I can see Mandel continuing to produce opus after opus without consideration of past successes. Mandel is not one to rest on her laurels. The Glass Hotel is as good if not better than Station Eleven although the comparison is difficult because The Glass Hotel is in an entirely different genre than Station Eleven. Station Eleven is a dystopian drama with a hopeful ending whereas The Glass Hotel is in a genre difficult to pinpoint. I‚Äôm not sure in what section of the bookstore this book belongs. Is it a crime drama, a thriller, a cautionary tale? It‚Äôs all of those and maybe more.In The Glass Hotel, Mandel taunts us with her masterful foretelling just as she did in her previous novels. Mandel has the ability to take us to a peak of intensity before laying down a seemingly random insight into the future leading us into a crescendo of resolution. In this novel Mandel weaves in and out of a metaphysical world that connects her characters in a web of intrigue and of consummate dissatisfaction. Most of her characters we might consider losers. Certainly, most of them are so bent on living a comfortable life that they are willing to invest all of themselves and their life savings in a Ponzi scheme run by a charming narcissist who convinces them that their lives and money are safe with him. Of course, they are mostly oblivious to the dangers involved in the kind of investment offered to them, but frankly, most of them are willing to turn a blind eye to the possibility of danger by the promise of wealth and glory. Some are not and become complicit themselves in the Ponzi. It was hard for me to relate to any of the characters although aspects of each of their personalities have attractive qualities suggesting that they are real humans engaged in real human activity. So, in fact, I could relate to all the characters in a limited sense.  Not all the characters in the book are Ponzi involved. The ones that aren‚Äôt are flawed in their own ways, but they are also on personal quests to find the peaceful life. By the end of the book we learn that all the characters, the ones that haven‚Äôt died, have adapted to their circumstances and carry on with life. I love the way Mandel grounds her characters in place yet lets them wander in and out of place, sometimes with unpleasant results, sometimes with a sense of inevitability. She includes a number of sub-plots in the development of her main plot yet they are all connected to the core of the novel and to the main characters. These sub-plots tell a rich story. I am particularly attracted to Olivia‚Äôs story. Maybe it‚Äôs because she is an artist struggling in a commercial and nasty world.I don‚Äôt want to give away any of the delicious story of The Glass Hotel, so I have avoided mentioning specific characters and their roles in the book. I leave you to discover those for yourselves.The Glass Hotel is a sensitive and essentially voyeuristic romp through the lives of a number of flawed characters, each with their own set of redeeming qualities, some more veiled than others. The way I judge any book I read, fiction or non-fiction is in my reluctance to put it down. I found The Glass Hotel difficult to put down. I read it well into the night, uncharacteristically for me, I can assure you of that!. I strongly recommend The Glass Hotel. It has superb plot development, a fascinating cast of sometimes endearing, sometimes despicable characters, and it is also a cautionary tale and a lesson in caveat emptor along with an exploration into the psychology of wishful thinking. Finally, it offers hope in the resilience some people demonstrate in the face of grievous loss.  Get the book.

A time of disease, fear and paranoia as we all head into the dark tunnel of a dystopian future where nothing can ever be assumed or taken for granted anymore.\n\n', '\n\n  British author Panayotis Cacoyannis was born and grew up in Cyprus, studied Law at Oxford, and then moved to London and qualified to practice at the Bar. The Legal landscape was not to his liking so he changed careers and entered Art School. Winning a Degree in Fine Art, and an MA in Painting from the Royal College of Art, he spent his next years painting and sculpting. Another career step directed him to courses in Creative Writing. So in his debut novel THE DEAD OF AUGUST he tossed in all prior experience and out came a novel that is a delight to read on many levels. Cacoyannis seems to have a penchant for satire and parody and has absorbed that inherently British sense of comedy touched with Cyprian flavors that makes his writing not only entertaining but lightens our own lives a bit - seeing how absurdity just may be the best medicine for surviving at the moment! Much the same can be said about his subsequent novels ‚Äì BOWL OF FRUIT (1907), POLK, HARPER & WHO, FINGER OF AN ANGEL, THE MADNESS OF GRIEF, and now THE COLDNESS OF OBJECTS - only now the increasing sophistication of how Panayotis dissects ‚Äòone man‚Äôs lonely rebellion and journey to courage, after early loss and a life of withdrawal and isolation‚Äô (from the author‚Äôs words) makes his work even more impressive.Panayotis sculpts figures ‚Äì his characters ‚Äì with such polish that in but a few words we are able to visualize and appreciate them. Example, as we meet Anthony Rubens: ‚ÄòIn the exquisite comfort of his favourite armchair ‚Äì an original, and signed, 1960s Amoeba ‚Äì Mr Rubens contemplated his surroundings with pleasure. He was a man of impeccable taste, if he sad so himself: a real connoisseur. One leg crossed over the other, rather sprawled in the vastness of this singular piece of design, he basked in the warm, affectionate light of the fiberglass lamp that loomed overhead, suspended from the ceiling by invisible threads. Mr Rubens held his cup in mid-air in a satisfied reverie as if to savour the moment for longer, though precisely what moment he savoured, and why, Mr Rubens would have found it hard to describe‚Ä¶‚Äô And very subtly we discover Mr Rubens is a gay man  simply by the author‚Äôs exceptional use of descriptive language.The story, so very successful on many levels, is condensed as follows: ‚ÄòLondon 2030. When a postman knocks on his door, the news he delivers will cause 70-year-old Anthony Pablo Rubens to reflect on all the sadnesses and joys of the past, while he begins to prepare for the surprises of the future. The past still revolves around the moment in the summer of 1984 when young Anthony first realized he had fallen in love. The present is a Kafkaesque nightmare worse than Orwell\'s 1984, ""a hideous world where people don\'t need to be watched by Big Brother."" It\'s a world that Anthony has mostly shut his eyes to, but which suddenly he is forced to confront. And the future now encompasses the mystery, and excitement, and dread of a day as an exhibit at the National People\'s Museum.‚ÄôWith this particularly fine novel Panayotis Cacoyannis confirms his accelerating status as a major author. He simply just gets better with each book. Highly recommended. Grady Harp, March 21\n\n']"

Love is a universal construct that exists cross-culturally, though it's definition is not always the same.All you have to do is google love, and you'll have thousands upon thousands of entries to get you started. If you're me, it means you spent the last 2 hours reading a bunch of that. It also means you just saw a mouse in the house, temporarily freaked out, and are now sitting with no feet anywhere near the ground.My mouse hunt revealed they're exiting under the kitchen door which means as soon as it's all sealed for the winter, no more mice.So by 8am tomorrow. NO MORE mice, but I digress.Okay, so this review might end up longer than all the rest. It is called Loch Ness Reviews for a reason.Where were we?Oh right, a definition of Love. It's something which Storm's book showcases. There are different kinds, they can develop slowly or at first sight. It can be scary, warm and fuzzy, and it can hurt as much as it can bring joy. Love makes us miserable, ecstatic, jealous, kind and comforting. The book follows two people's lives and how they become intertwined with family, friends and loss.As a good university student would to (which I'm not anymore, arguably I was not a great student either...  ), I'll showcase for you, a definition of love according to The Oxford Dictionary Online.Definition of LoveFrom the Oxford Dictionary Onlinenoun[mass noun]1a strong feeling of affection:babies fill parents with intense feelings of lovetheir love for their countrya strong feeling of affection and sexual attraction for someone:they were both in love with herwe were slowly falling in loveaffectionate greetings conveyed to someone on one's behalf:give her my lovea formula for ending an affectionate letter:take care, lots of love, Judy2a great interest and pleasure in something:his love for footballwe share a love of music3 [count noun] a person or thing that one loves:she was the love of his lifetheir two great loves are tobacco and whiskyBritish informal a friendly form of address:it's all right, love(a love) informal used in affectionate requests:don't fret, there's a love4(in tennis, squash, and some other sports) a score of zero; nil:love fifteen[apparently from the phrase play for love (i.e. the love of the game, not for money); folk etymology has connected the word with French l'oeuf 'egg', from the resemblance in shape between an egg and a zero]verb[with object]feel deep affection or sexual love for (someone):do you love me?like or enjoy very much:I'd love a cup of teaI just love dancingHaving had my share of relationships, non-relationships, questionable relationships and well lets just call some of them mistakes, I wondered what I would learn from this book about love that I didn't already know.The answer? Well I knew most of it already, but I did learn that there are some pretty decent ways to deal with loss and love and mistakes. The book deals with romantic love, parental love, compassionate and friendly love. The love between partners, family and soul mates. It also deals with the loss of all of those. It's a terribly sad and heart wrenching story, it's also simultaneously up lifting and joyous. There's peace at the end, even though there's also loss.Life goes on, and while Daly suffers from the loss of her cheating boyfriend, true love and a lasting partnership sneak up behind her.He hadn't had his flute out for a while either.They really do say that line about the sweet spot and not having his flute out for a while in that episode (s05e25). (In first person of course, I believe he says 'I haven't had my flute out in a long time.') Go ahead gafaw. I do.To prove a point though, Picard's flute makes two important debuts in the Star Trek TNG series. One, above involves Picard taking his flute out again, after not having played for a very long time. He falls in love with an enchanting 'lady', and while they don't make it and ultimately aren't right for each other, they have their time. It's a little like Daly and her cheating boyfriend except Picard isn't an ass, and there's no cheating.In the other flute episode, we see a much different side of Picard's love.In the first flute episode, Picard becomes the victim of a time well let's call it a time-issue. The planet he ends up on isn't the same as the ship's time in orbit. So after much confusion and what is on the surface of the planet a life-time, Picard learns to love his family.Hi family thinks he's just been sick, he knows he's from a 'star-ship' in the sky. He gives up and learns to love life and his 'new' family and play music. Of course, he's rescued by the end of the episode, and loses what for him has been a lifetime with a family, children and grandchildren.Who cares about Star Trek? Well clearly me, but mostly because it illustrates a point. A Colorful Life is epic in the same way that Star Trek was. It tells a timeless story that shows us we all suffer, and we are all human. Just like Star Trek, A Colorful Life doesn't give us a magic answer. It simply suggests that we live life with no regrets, and we try to be as true to ourselves a possible.Caveat: In my head I just had the terrible conversation with myself that took that in a whole different direction, because flutes are rather phallic. Then I decided to re-evaluate archetypes, then I decided maybe I'm Guinan...I do like bald men, and I Do have that hair, and I've always wanted to be 'special'. I'm pretty sure Guinan had her s*** together. I want to be like Daly the same way I'd like to have Guinan powers.I've read all of Melissa Storm's books to date. I've even read all her children's books. She has a gift. She can take words, form them into stories for children, young-adults and adults. Those stories all have a message of peace and love, and they don't ignore all the bad s*** that happens to people either. She opens up the story so the reader can identify with the characters in much the same way mass pop culture identified with the star trek actors and characters. (I swear there are normal people who like star trek out there.)Yes, that's rather crass, but there's a lot of bad-s*** going down everywhere. All you have to do is open up a newspaper, or go online to any news source.Melissa Storm's writing while at times sad and painfully real still leave us with a glimmer of hope. Her writing has helped me find a voice in this crazy world, and made me realize that even though we're all quirky and weird, there's a place for all of us.That's why this review took so damned long, and that's why it's now 930 at night and I'm eating grilled cheese. You'd think I'd stay away from thing mice like. Instead I decided to say 'screw-it' and make what I wanted to eat. Much like I've decided life can deal with me the way I am or stuff it. I'll live and love the way I choose, and with no regrets.And no, it's not just any grilled cheese.Four-cheese gorgeousness grillerIn a frying pan, put some butter.Put bottom slice of bread in frying pan on top of butter on low.Spread zucchini butter on top halfAdd Shredded Mozzerella and Moterey Jack CheeseCrumble on top of that Feta CheeseAdd sliced Havarti (about 4/1 layer same size as the bread)Season with Montreal Steak Spice, or whatever taste you desire. Sometimes I use hot sauce, sometimes I add tomatoes and/or bacon. The best way to do it with bacon is fry the bacon first then don't use butter at all. (It's sinful, and delicious.)Put on top slice of BreadFlip Immediately.I have it timed so that the cheese is mostly melted, and flipping it right after putting on the top layer of bread is both easier and ensures the bottom one doesn't get burnt. My burner is set to about 2 or 3.

  NEW YORK TIMES BESTSELLER ‚Ä¢ From the bestselling author of Before We Were Yours comes a dramatic historical novel of three young women searching for family amid the destruction of the post‚ÄìCivil War South, and of a modern-day teacher who learns of their story and its vital connection to her students‚Äô lives.‚ÄúAn absorbing historical . . . enthralling.‚Äù‚ÄîLibrary JournalBestselling author Lisa Wingate brings to life startling stories from actual ‚ÄúLost Friends‚Äù advertisements that appeared in Southern newspapers after the Civil War, as newly freed slaves desperately searched for loved ones who had been sold away.Louisiana, 1875: In the tumultuous era of Reconstruction, three young women set off as unwilling companions on a perilous quest: Hannie, a freed slave; Lavinia, the pampered heir to a now destitute plantation; and Juneau Jane, Lavinia‚Äôs Creole half sister. Each carries private wounds and powerful secrets as they head for Texas, following roads rife with vigilantes and soldiers still fighting a war lost a decade before. For Lavinia and Juneau Jane, the journey is one of stolen inheritance and financial desperation, but for Hannie, torn from her mother and siblings before slavery‚Äôs end, the pilgrimage west reignites an agonizing question: Could her long-lost family still be out there? Beyond the swamps lie the limitless frontiers of Texas and, improbably, hope.Louisiana, 1987: For first-year teacher Benedetta Silva, a subsidized job at a poor rural school seems like the ticket to canceling her hefty student debt‚Äîuntil she lands in a tiny, out-of-step Mississippi River town.

Each unpredictable twist and turn throws the reader into every scene, living and experiencing as if there.\n\n', '\n\n  Rich characterization and a page-turning plot makes for a fast-paced, and interesting story. This is the third in the Kate Marshall series following ‚ÄúNine Elms‚Äù and ‚ÄúShadow Sands‚Äù.  Anyone who missed reading the first two novels in the series should have no qualms about reading ‚ÄúDarkness Falls‚Äù as enough background information is included that it reads very well as a stand-alone novel. However, I think it enriches the reading experience if you read the series in order to get the complete backstory of the characters.I enjoyed Kate Marshall‚Äôs character and her relationships with her assistant, and her son. All were rich and believable. Kate has more baggage than most women in their forties and she is working hard to leave it behind her ‚Äì including her longing for alcohol. A ‚Äòday at a time‚Äô battle that she is determined to overcome.The atmospheric locale added greatly to my enjoyment of the novel.The narrative is well-balanced between the ‚Äòcase‚Äô and Kate‚Äôs home life. This time out the duo seek to achieve what the police have failed to do in twelve years. They want to find out what became of the journalist Joanna Duncan. Also, this story tells of their efforts to maintain the caravan park and dive shop that were part of Kate‚Äôs inheritance from Myra.‚ÄúDarkness Falls‚Äù probes themes of duplicity and crimes against gay men.The ending was the perfect denouement to show how they solved the case and also as a lead-up to the next Kate Marshall title which is highly anticipated by me.Highly recommended to all lovers of intelligent crime fiction.\n\n', '\n\n  Robert Bryndza is back with another intense crime thriller with Kate Marshall at the helm. With a sordid past as a police detective, Kate has opened up her own investigative agency and is ready to take on the world. She‚Äôs given a cold case, where a journalist disappeared twelve years before. While there are some possible avenues to explore, the police have given up. All that being said, Kate and her partner begin finding a new and interesting connection with some other cold cases in the area, which could be the momentum they need to acquire answers.Kate Marshall had high hopes when she worked for the Metropolitan Police, but addiction and other skeletons in her closet kept her from being able to stay on the right path. She‚Äôs taken her skills and turned it into something great, opening a private investigative agency, supplementing her time as a lecturer at the local university. Working with her partner, Tristan Harper, Kate is hoping to make a name for herself and earn a decent living.When she‚Äôs given a cold case, Kate has high hopes that she and Tristan will be able to solve it. A journalist went missing twelve years before, one who was gritty and determined like few others. She‚Äôd brought down a sitting Member of Parliament for potential indiscretions, but he had a solid alibi for the time of the disappearance. Working through the police files given over by the family, Kate and Tristan come across some names that do not seem to fit.Deeper digging reveals that these were young men who went missing in the years before the journalist‚Äôs disappearance. They frequented gay bars and some had a connection of a commune in the area. The more Kate and Tristan push, the stronger the potential connection of the disappearances. Could someone have been trying to write a story, connecting the missing men to someone around the bars?All the while, a killer lurks just out of sight. Their target is one of the seedy bars on the outskirts of town. When a young man is found raped and murdered, Kate cannot help but wonder if there is a connection to the cold cases she has on her radar. Forensics makes some connections, but there is nothing to tie these disappearances to any particular killer. Still, things may be slowly coming together, but at what cost? Another great novel by Robert Bryndza that will keep readers flipping pages into the night.I always enjoy a great thriller and Robert Bryndza has never failed to deliver. His attention to detail is like no other and he finds intriguing ways to keep the reader engaged throughout. The stories are not outlandish, but neither are they plain and easily deduced. This is the second of Bryndza‚Äôs series that I have tried, which is equally as intense and has me wanting more.Kate Marshall has a major backstory that continues to reveal itself here. While series fans will know some of her past, Kate is still trying to come to terms with them, as things emerge to remind her of where she was all those years before. Bryndza allows for some wonderful character development here, both professional and personal, which offers Kate Marshall a new perspective as she is getting her life in order. I am eager to see where things will take her in the coming novels, as I am ready for more as soon as possible.Robert Bryndza is an amazing writer with strong capabilities. He writes well and keeps the story moving along. The narrative builds from the opening chapter and there is no time at which I felt things dragged. The story evolved well, using short chapters to tease the reader into pushing forward just a little more. Tackling social and societal issues amongst the murder investigation, Bryndza does not shy away from topics and keeps the reader educated throughout the experience. I can only hope for more, as he has a knack when it comes to crimes thrillers!Kudos, Mr. Bryndza, for another winner. Don‚Äôt keep us wondering for too long, as your fans surely love what you have to offer.\n\n', '\n\n  Darkness Falls is another gripping thriller in the Kate Marshall series.Kate and her partner Tristan are getting their detective agency up and running on a cold case that involves the disappearance of journalist Joanna Duncan.At the same time gay men are disappearing and being murdered.Did Joanna know something that the police did not?Robert Bryndza does a great job leaving clues and red herrings and once again he out smarted this reader.Thought I knew but I was wrong.I thoroughly enjoy anything written by Mr. Bryndza and the Kate Marshall series is no exception.

Maybe this is because I feel that I am in the sort of position these people once were with respect to my current career path but I think the main point is just to gain awareness of the obstacles some of us may have to overcome, whether its surrounding ourselves with better people or searching for opportunities in a field that is important to us. Some things we can change and some we can't, so we might as well work with what we can change and control.\n\n"", '\n\n  A masterful analysis of the critical factors which determine individual success in almost any field or endeavor. Gladwell as usual poses the conventional wisdom and then proceeds to tear it to shreds in example after example of how famous people have obtained success.

While native intelligence is important, it is not the critical factor in determining the potential for success. Over and over, Gladwell provides examples which show that luck, being at the right place at the right time and spending an inordinate amount of time perfecting a task are the determinants of success.\n\n']"
