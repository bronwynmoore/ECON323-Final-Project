I will just say Collette has Triumphed with this Treasure. I want a man like Flynn, Earl of Luxmoore! He is a gentle man of honour, integrity and caring in the way he treats the ladies of his family, our Heroine Angelina and even the Duchess of Waterford.I will say though I got angry for both H&H and I wanted to smack the villainous Duke of Waterford upside the head when gets so drunk he forgets himself in mixed company and then at his reprehensible conduct later on in the book (shh no spoiler).  I also wanted a little more anger from Flynn towards the Duke for being the instigator of 'his best friend', Flynn's Father's death.I like how Collette included other characters from previous books and a little play-by-play to tempt us towards the coming novels. I kept flipping back and forth to my books TBR to check as to where they fit and if I had read their stories yet.  That was my only hic-up. I kind of wish she hadn't included as much info in the epilogue as I think a pairing (or two) are mentioned that haven't been written yet and will be a future 'Romancing a Scot Series' book.I truly enjoyed this book and eagerly await the next in the series.

It is just the sweetest story that still requires some suspension of disbelief because the MCs have to fall in love in less than a week. But I've always believed that if an author can execute a romance well enough, then it shouldn't matter how many days it takes. And Walker definitely executes it well.The story follows Cass and Jayden. Cass moved back to his hometown of Hartbrigde after his divorce and started working in a B&B. And three years later, he's about to welcome his first guests. Jayden is his chef for the holidays. Jayden is an Aussie ex-pat who moves around a lot. But recently, he's become disenchanted with the life of a wanderer and wants to find a home. Of course, he doesn't expect that home to be in Hartbridge.The story is set in the few days leading up to Christmas. Cass and Jayden click almost immediately, in that they like to talk to each other and spend time together. Jayden is in awe of how sweet, humble, and hardworking Cass is. And Cass loves Jayden's generosity and free spirit.Saying that Cass and Jayden are adorable together would be an understatement. The two of them are so cute, and I couldn't stop smiling the whole book. The story is entirely free of angst, yet there's not a dull moment as the protagonists spend their days working, talking and flirting (lots of flirting). They spend a lot of quality time getting to know each other. And that, plus the lightheartedness of the book, was what really sold the romance for me.I liked the first book in the series too, but it felt like there wasn't enough, or that something was missing. Nothing was missing here. I loved Cass and Jayden together, I loved the setting, and I loved the warmth of the tone. This was a very sweet story, and I highly recommend it.\n\n"", '\n\n  <b> Contains: employee-boss, many emotional first times with a man, tender gestures, filled with love, chef and B&B owner. </b>The book is completely <b> the sweetest fluffy story ever. </b> We find ourselves back in this charming country village straight out of a Christmas movie.We find Cass, freshly separated from his wife and trying to set up a B&B. He hires a chef for the holidays, Jayden. We find a slow-burn relation between Cass who was <b> trying to maintain a professional relationship </b> with his cook.<b>  I removed a star because </b> I am not a fanatic of taking this slow in books, there is no sexy time before 75%.

Great setting, fun characters, love (basically) at first sight. Christmas and family and YASSS! I love Cass’ story about coming out late in life and how supportive his family is. I love it all!!!! I can’t wait for more in this series.\n\n', '\n\n  Really enjoyed this, read it all the way thru without a break!  Sweet interesting characters that make you care about them, witty dialogue and heart tugging confessions. Awesome 👌\n\n', '\n\n  Loved this sweet holiday story and I adored the dynamic between these two characters. Off to read book one! Do yourself a favour and put this on your to-read Christmas Wish List.\n\n', '\n\n  Enjoyed this one even more than Tic Tac Mistletoe. Another awesome holiday romance from a talented author. Perfect for Christmas!\n\n', ""\n\n  YES! I was so excited when I saw this novel had been released. After reading Tic-Tac-Mistletoe (Book 1) in January 2021, I was waiting patiently... okay, not so patiently - for Book 2, and it did not disappoint!Cass and Jayden are instantly such loveable characters, both bringing their own strengths to the novel that it was hard to put it down. Their determination and support for one another was lovely to read - as was how welcoming the town was to Jayden. Even more so was the way the author introduced us to Cass' ex-wife and two children, and instead of their being drama and hatred between the two exes, showing us the spport and love that they still had for one another despite the divorce.The only problem is that I have read this book at the end of November, and now Christmas can't come soon enough. If only I had a large mansion, open fireplaces and a copious amount of hot chocolate (and some gingerbread cake...) to spend my days in while we await the visit from the big guy in the red suit.Already counting down the days until Christmas 2022, when we will hopefully get another visit in with the Hartbridge lot!\n\n"", '\n\n  CHRISTMAS WISH LIST follows Jayden Turner as he takes a short-term position as the chef for a bed and breakfast that’s opening for the holidays. There’s instant attraction between him and his new boss, Carter (Cass) Campion. Cass recently came out to his family and friends, but he hasn’t really had the time to explore his sexuality.-This was a sweet holiday romance! It’s a light, low angst read, perfect for this busy month. It does also has some sexy moments. Think small-town Hallmark holiday romance, but with a little bit of spice.I really enjoyed seeing Cass with his family (his parents, his ex wife, their kids) and how they all welcomed Jayden. I liked Ren and Hamish and the little bit of tension between Cass and Hamish was interesting.I would have liked this story to be more fleshed out and have it go deeper, but I’m still satisfied with this light read.-I didn’t realize this was a sequel to a book I bought recently until I started reading it. I haven’t read book 1 (TIC-TAC-MISTLETOE) yet but this book made me even more excited to pick it up.-3.5 stars, CHRISTMAS WISH LIST by N. R. Walker is available now!-Thank you to Blueheart Press and Netgalley for sending me an eARC to review.\n\n']"

As soon as this is made known to the Italian resistance, they call upon him to spy as he now has access to the German war machines plans for Italy.And just around the same time, he meets and falls in love with a girl.  She is working as a maid for the mistress of his boss,  General Hans Leyers.  The love story of these two is an important part of the tale.The atrocities he viewed, the death and destructtion he lived with on a daily basis, would have been too much for most to bear, but somehow,  this young man, only eighteen years old performed the duties he felt he owed to his country and country men with bravery above and beyond what is normal.These secrets and many others he kept all his life.  After the war he moved to the U.S.A. and lived a decent life but kept mum about his wartime experiences until Mark Sullivan, the author, was able to convince him to tell his story.  I, for one, am glad he did.  Historically, this gave me a much better picture of Italy during the war and the brave men and woman who risked their lives to go up against the Germans who occupied their territory as they had their original enemies, like Poland, France and the Netherlands.\n\n', '\n\n  This is, hands down, one of the very best WW2 books I\'ve ever read.  I was constantly shaking my head in amazement at the things Pino went through, his attitude all through the war, his never-ending readiness and desire to ""do the right thing.""  Mark Sullivan did an excellent job in writing this book, he made Pino so real to me that I feel as if I\'ve sat at the table and visited with him.  Beautiful, beautiful job.  Thank you to Pino for all he did and thank you to Mark Sullivan for telling his incredible story.\n\n', ""\n\n  Beneath a Scarlet Sky is so smoothly written that it feels like I'm watching a poignant documentary on TV. The characters are true to life and I feel what they feel as if I were there. But, it's Italy, WW2. Not a good time to be in Italy. We live through the war with the lead character, a teenager turning rapidly into a man. As he balances being drafted against becoming a member of the resistance and likely a short life...well. either way it could be very short...another option presents itself. He can wear a Nazi uniform and drive for the #2 Nazi commander, essentially becoming a spy for the Allies. As a driver he becomes deeply aware of troubling decisions which he reports back. Compensation for his danger comes in meeting a beautiful girl whom he falls in love with. Together they hope to see things through safely to the end of the war. But Fate is not kind. The Nazis do not retreat from Italy as the war bends in favor of Allied troops. The people of Italy suffer dreadfully as the Nazis hang on...Until they rise up and attack the Nazi overlords in support of the Allied invasion. Lives are lost. It is the price of freedom, a price that leaves deep scars even for courageous heroes. You will feel their losses and rejoice in their victories.\n\n"", '\n\n  At the outset of World War II, Pino Lella is a normal Italian teenager. But, when the Nazis invade Italy, he is sent to a monastery in the Alps, where he is embroiled in plan to sneak Jews across the Swiss border to safety. On reaching his 18th birthday, his parents force him to enlist with the Nazis in order to ride out the war unharmed. Unable to stomach collaboration, Pino becomes a spy for the resistance.What I liked about this book was the insight into an aspect of the war I had never learned of before. Book stores are full of war stories from England, France and the Netherlands. There are even a fair few holocaust stories set within Germany or Poland. Yet, this is the first time I\'ve read anything about Italy, one of the axis powers, during World War II. Until reading this book, I did not know, because I had never thought of it, that many Italians resisted not only the Nazis, but Mussolini as well. I also did not know that priests, bishops and other church officials were actively engaged in smuggling Jews to safety.As for the rest, I wasn\'t terribly impressed. The writing leans far too heavily on tell on not nearly enough on show. This does switch somewhat towards the end, but it made getting to the end a struggle. The characters were two-dimensional. I just couldn\'t find a way to relate to them.Throughout the narrative, I kept wondering if perhaps the author relied too much on the word of Pino Lella himself. In the story, Pino is so constantly heroic, so consistently exceeds any expectation of a boy his age (expert mountaineer, fluent in three languages, expert race car driver, gifted piano player without seeming to ever practice) that it comes across as bordering on propaganda.If you are fascinated by war stories, you may enjoy ""Beneath a Scarlet Sky,"" but it\'s probably more well suited to young adults.\n\n', ""\n\n  I never read war novels. I don't like how the violence and emotion inherent in war play with my senses and seem to scar my imagination, and my zest for life. I am, however, an avid reader and especially appreciate novels that are based on true stories. Beneath A Scarlet Sky took that which I detest and that which I love and weaved it so poignantly and beautifully together in a single masterpiece that I could not stop reading until the end was known and the questions were answered. So engrossed was I its content and backstory, that I relished even the acknowledgements as they lent substance and credibility to this work of art. Highly recommend.\n\n""]"

Once their desires are out in the open, they realize they have the perfect set-up. He doesn’t want love, she doesn’t have time for love, so that just leaves the sex. Their arrangement could be surprisingly seamless, as long as Tate can stick to the only two rules Miles has for her.Never ask about the past. Don’t expect a future.They think they can handle it, but realize almost immediately they can’t handle it at all.Hearts get infiltrated. Promises get broken. Rules get shattered.Love gets ugly.

Now, I need to take a solid break from reading (as i always do after finishing colleens books).\n\n"", ""\n\n  Colleen Hoover has done it again. Not that I ever doubted her, but I didn’t know what to expect when starting Ugly Love. It’s safe to say she never disappoints. With her amazing writing style, fascinating characters and original story lines, I was hooked from the beginning. I expected to love this book. What I wasn’t expecting was for my heart to be shredded.Ugly.\u2028Love.\u2028Destroyed.Me.\u2028This book pulled at my heartstrings. I felt so much heartache while reading. There were some lighter moments, but the majority felt heavy and emotional.When Tate decides to move in with her brother for a while, she never expects to meet a man like Miles. Miles is a pilot like her brother. Miles is taciturn. He seems flat. But there is something about him that intrigues Tate.I have no idea what’s going through his head. He never smiles. He never laughs. He doesn’t flirt. His face appears as if he keeps a constant veil of armor between his expressions and the rest of the world.\u2028Miles and Tate develop a friendship, kind of. It’s difficult to be friends with someone who is closed off like Miles is. You can just feel the sadness radiating off of him. Then it happens. Tate feels like she is starting to make progress with this man.Miles really likes Tate. But the last thing he is looking for is love. Their attraction and chemistry is too strong to deny, so they go with the whole ‘friends with benefits’ thing. As long as Tate can follow Mile’s two rules, they can be together in that way.“Don’t ask about my past,” he says firmly.  “And never expect a future.”\u2028Tate is so enamored with Miles, she’ll take him any way she can get him. She’s never felt this strongly about a man. She feels so much when she’s with him, she can’t get enough.Miles is the way he is for a good reason. The book is in dual pov, going back and forth between Tate’s perspective in the present, and Miles perspective in the past. You get to see as time goes on, why Miles has these rules and why he is protecting his heart this way. When you get hurt in such an ugly way, you want nothing to do with love. No matter how beautiful it can be. But that doesn’t stop Tate from developing feelings for him. Even though she knows they can never be reciprocated.Miles is a character that broke my heart. At first you see his past and the type of guy he was… then you see him so standoffish in the present. It makes you wonder what could have happened to make him that way. I had my theories (all of which were wrong) but once I found out- I wish I would have been right. It was something unimaginable and you can see why he wouldn’t be able to move on from that.I loved the chemistry and the slow build between them. Even though the feelings were fought most of the book, you could still feel them brewing just below the surface.I think every book I’ve read by this author has made me cry. Even if it’s just a few tears, I always cry. This book. I did more than just cry a few tears. Oh the tears. There were times I couldn’t control the tears. They just streamed down my face continually while I read through them. It was heart wrenching and so emotional. Ugly Love made me Ugly Cry. Big time. Some parts were worse than others, but wow. I just FELT so much while reading this.I am a huge Colleen Hoover fan and I’ve read every one of her books. This one has a little something different than the others. Most of her books make me feel strongly and contain a lot of emotional moments, and Ugly Love had that for sure... but it also had much more steam than the others. And yes- CoHo can write some sexy scenes!It’s been a while since I’ve read a paperback book, but when I heard this was out early at several bookstores, I ran to my local store and picked up a copy along with a mini light so I could read in bed. And I did. I stayed up way past my bedtime reading this book. I went into work the next day sleepy and raw from crying, but let me tell you- it was worth it! Although Hopeless still takes the top spot of my favorite book by this author, this will be a close second!Colleen Hoover is one of those people who is doing what she was born to do- she's sharing her amazing stories with us. Her writing style is unique and incredible. Ugly Love is captivating, beautiful, emotional, and devastatingly painful to read but I’ll let you in on a little secret. The ending makes every ounce of pain I felt worth it. An unforgettable story I highly recommend!\n\n"", '\n\n  I loved this book so much finish it in one night.. I was so satisfied w the ending.. i laughed and cried so much.. even though this book is only three hundred pgs it feels like so much more. I’ve only ever read one book besides this one that was written by Colleen and I can feel she is is an amazing writer.. I recommend this to anybody who like romance but w a catch.\n\n', ""\n\n  I was a Colleen Hoover virgin before I read this book. I'm not sure what took me so long but when the amazing author Belle Brooks told me I needed to read it, I listened.I’m now hooked.Ugly Love took me on an emotional journey and I enjoyed every minute of it.It was beautifully written.So much so, that about halfway way through, my instinct was to trash every story I've ever written because they'll never be as good as this one.I managed to refrain... for now.Guess who’s going to one-click every book with Colleen Hoover’s name on it?Me.\n\n""]"

Although I was impressed with her comedy ability in Ruthless Creatures, I’m all in for giving her comedian of the year. Except the more we learn about Sloane the more we see where this funny Sloane comes from and the more I want to nominate her woman of the year. She is one strong woman!The man in charge though, dear lord, when Declan speaks, whispers, laughs I can hear that Irish lilt in my ears, his husky voice, there were parts of this book where I got shivers down my spine just thinking about his beautiful Irish brogue.Moving on from that voice, this anti-hero, this dominant, this man and those blue eyes…you can see them in your mind can’t you. The hot molten looks he gives Sloane, the small swirl of steam that gives over to that rush of everything that sets your inside on fire and ends up with that satisfying smile afterwards. These two are so connected it’s like it has been ordained by the gods.These two go from an OMG she’s crazy to dear god I am obsessed relationship. She makes him smile, she makes him hot, she makes him want to forget about who he really is and he hopes she never finds out. For Sloane it’s the fact that Declan is like no other man she has known and she isn’t sure how to handle him but she will learn.As I got closer to the end I thought, I can’t be almost done I need more of these two. Their story moved quickly, it changed; it made you give second thought to some of the characters. You don’t ever realize you are flipping those pages; there were no one more chapters, and for now it is done!So we wait, we wait to find out how this all ends and I can honestly say that ending, I did not see that coming!

She brings men to their knees within minutes of talking to them. Absolutely love her. When I grow up...I want to be like Sloane.This book is so good. Sloane getting kidnapped by the Irish mafia. This story gives us a little captive romance. The bdsm theme translates into this book as well. Love the smut. It was so great to see a character like Sloane be dominated.

It starts innocently enough. While the residents of the Québec village of Three Pines take advantage of the deep snow to ski and toboggan, to drink hot chocolate in the bistro and share meals together, the Chief Inspector finds his holiday with his family interrupted by a simple request. He’s asked to provide security for what promises to be a non-event.  A visiting Professor of Statistics will be giving a lecture at the nearby university. While he is perplexed as to why the head of homicide for the Sûreté du Québec would be assigned this task, it sounds easy enough.  That is until Gamache starts looking into Professor Abigail Robinson and discovers an agenda so repulsive he begs the university to cancel the lecture.They refuse, citing academic freedom, and accuse Gamache of censorship and intellectual cowardice.  Before long, Professor Robinson’s views start seeping into conversations.  Spreading and infecting.  So that truth and fact, reality and delusion are so confused it’s near impossible to tell them apart.Discussions become debates, debates become arguments, which turn into fights.  As sides are declared, a madness takes hold.    Abigail Robinson promises that, if they follow her, ça va bien aller.  All will be well.  But not, Gamache and his team know, for everyone.When a murder is committed it falls to Armand Gamache, his second-in-command Jean-Guy Beauvoir, and their team to investigate the crime as well as this extraordinary popular delusion.

And after that are we supposed to care when someone takes a pot shot at her?Anyway, she is not the murder victim,  you must wait until the middle of the book to find out who is.  Then it will be left to Armand Gamache, his son-in-law Jean Guy, and his loyal assistant, Isabelle Lacoste to solve the crime.  By the way, when did Jean Guy come back from France and start working for Gamache again?If I have a criticism about the book, it would be that I would have like to see and  hear more from the usual villagers, like Ruth, Myrna, and the owners of the Bistro whom we readers have come to think of as our own family of friends.  The entire Gamache family is staying with Reine Marie and Armand, but it is never explained why they are all back from Paris.  I felt like I missed some continuity somehow.And the way, Gamache solved this murder, jumping from one ""Ah Ha"" moment to the next as he discovered one piece of evidence, and then another and another,  was contrived and gave me whiplash changing from one suspect to another, like a bad Hercule Poirot imitation.  A rather strange investigation for such a brilliant detective.I still have a soft spot for all the usual characters in the book and Louise Penny and her written creations.\n\n', ""\n\n  4.5 stars Whenever a new book by Louise Penny is published, it immediately goes to the top of my reading list. Set in the idyllic, charming village of Three Pines, Quebec, Penny has designed a place where I want to live. I want to get to know the people in this community and to eat in the Bistro. Her characters are so well developed that they seem real, and with each book, we get to know them better; their kindness, their foibles and quirks, their place in the village, and their relationships with neighbors and friends. In many ways, this is the best and most powerful book in the series. It is deep, dark, and provocative.There are moral dilemmas and ethical discussions and much food for thought. There is a murder, of course, amongst the sparkling winter landscape, hot chocolate, and outdoor activities with the children playing in the snow.  After a long time following COVID restrictions, the villagers have come out of isolation, delighted that the vaccine has ended the pandemic. They are now free to congregate, hug, discard masks, and resume a normal life, but the pandemic has left them with grief and lingering sadness. This post-COVID setting is a little too soon while we are still in the midst of the 4th wave in most places, even when fully vaccinated. I felt the plot became convoluted when possible motives, opportunities, and suspects were discussed and with the added inclusion of a killing long in the past. These theories seemed to be contemplated repeatedly to the point of tedium but gave the reader a puzzle to ponder. Chief Inspector Armand Gamache is back. He is Head of Homicide for the Surete de Quebec. Team members Isabelle and Jean-Guy, his son-in-law, are also involved in the investigations. The Gamache family now has several grandchildren. Fellow villagers, like the artist Claire, Myrna, who runs a bookstore, Gabe and Olivier, managers of the Bistro (shut down during the pandemic), are now busy and open for business. It was great to be reacquainted with the elderly, foul-mouthed, eccentric poet Ruth with her pet duck. She is much more insightful than people believe. There are three visitors to Three Pines. Do they have hidden agendas?  Why are they there in the dead of winter? Gamache has been requested to provide security at a lecture for a visiting statistician, Abigal Robinson. He feels that there will be little attendance in a small nearby University in the dead of winter and that statistics are not a stimulating subject. However, he learns that she holds abhorrent conclusions and that many are traveling in to hear her speech. She is personally charming, but her views are dangerous and morally repellent. Gamache tries to have the lecture canceled but is unsuccessful. Gamache is haunted by a scene he witnessed in a nursing home where the elderly were neglected and left to die.  Based on her research to be presented to the Quebec Premier on how COVID had dire effects on health care and the economy, Abigal is advocating forced euthanasia on the elderly and disabled. Shots are fired at the lecture, and chaos results. Abigal is visiting with her friend and assistant. The other newcomer is Haniya Daoud, a young Nobel Peace Prize nominee from Sudan. She has experienced the most horrible, nightmarish torture before her escape to freedom. Living in an isolated cabin in the woods is a professor who, as a young doctor, participated in some factual and dreadful mind-altering experiments at McGill University on behalf of the CIA. He knew what was happening but kept quiet about it. These left many of the subjects damaged for life. He keeps this part of his life secret but is unpopular as he did nothing to help the community during the COVID lockdown. On New Year's eve, there is a murder in a nearby wooded area while most villagers enjoyed a party. An intelligent and empathetic Gamache and his team must question the possible suspects and figure out the killer's motive.  This turns out to be a very complex and difficult investigation and asks if a murder can be motivated by love as well as hate. Can there ever be a justification for killing?  This was an enthralling, thought-provoking novel involving the reader's emotions with some tear-jerking moments and surprising twists and revelations, tension and suspense, a difficult puzzle, and captivating characters.\n\n"", '\n\n  Let me start by saying I LOVE Louise Penny and all the characters in Three Pines.  I did NOT, however, love this latest installment entitled ""The Madness of Crowds.""In the acknowledgments, Penny talks about how she initially wanted to avoid discussing the pandemic in the book, thinking people would not want to read about the coronavirus when they were dealing with it day by day in the real world.  She says she changed her mind halfway through the first draft, deciding to set the book after the pandemic was over.  Personally, I wanted to revisit Three Pines as one of the few things untouched by this global crisis. In addition, the virus in the book ended after the second wave, while our reality is currently dealing with the fourth wave.  I therefore read the book feeling a bit depressed and off kilter.Usually, I read each Penny book very quickly, caught up in the plot and characters.  I kept putting this book down. I felt the plot went in circles at times, although, considering the title, maybe that was the intent.  There were also 2 or 3 times that a character said something only to have it repeated a page or two later: I feel this is more of an editing issue but it bothered me.Sadly, I feel disappointed by ""The Madness of Crowds"" but look forward to my next visit to Three Pines.\n\n']"

She is talented for her detailed & descriptive writing.The only downfall that takes this review from a ‘4 to a 3’ is the feeling the book didn’t have to be filled with so much repeated words on her internal struggle with Luna’s character (too much written on Jason, for sure).That said, Luna’s ability to bring charm to the big burly scary guy was sweet, Luna & Rip were great characters, and I loved the variety of people she called friends and family.I had to read till the end to know what happened but it was way too long, for me!  Loved Ripley and how his change was written to see little things occurring, sparking the romance feel but it was definitely a ‘slow burn’ until the end.\n\n', '\n\n  I prefer my books written in the third person. This author has a very poignant way of telling a story.too bad it’s in the first person and only shows the story through one person s point of view. Synch a waist.

  The internationally acclaimed, New York Times bestselling author returns to the magnificent universe he constructed in his bestselling novels The Shadow of the Wind, The Angel’s Game, and The Prisoner of Heaven in this riveting series finale—a heart-pounding thriller and nail-biting work of suspense which introduces a sexy, seductive new heroine whose investigation shines a light on the dark history of Franco’s Spain.In this unforgettable final volume of Ruiz Zafón’s cycle of novels set in the universe of the Cemetery of Forgotten Books, beautiful and enigmatic Alicia Gris, with the help of the Sempere family, uncovers one of the most shocking conspiracies in all Spanish history.Nine-year-old Alicia lost her parents during the Spanish Civil War when the Nacionales (the fascists) savagely bombed Barcelona in 1938. Twenty years later, she still carries the emotional and physical scars of that violent and terrifying time. Weary of her work as an investigator for Spain’s secret police in Madrid, a job she has held for more than a decade, the twenty-nine-year old plans to move on. At the insistence of her boss, Leandro Montalvo, she remains to solve one last case: the mysterious disappearance of Spain’s Minister of Culture, Mauricio Valls.With her partner, the intimidating policeman Juan Manuel Vargas, Alicia discovers a possible clue—a rare book by the author Victor Mataix hidden in Valls’ office in his Madrid mansion. Valls was the director of the notorious Montjuic Prison in Barcelona during World War II where several writers were imprisoned, including David Martín and Victor Mataix. Traveling to Barcelona on the trail of these writers, Alicia and Vargas meet with several booksellers, including Juan Sempere, who knew her parents.As Alicia and Vargas come closer to finding Valls, they uncover a tangled web of kidnappings and murders tied to the Franco regime, whose corruption is more widespread and horrifying than anyone imagined. Alicia’s courageous and uncompromising search for the truth puts her life in peril. Only with the help of a circle of devoted friends will she emerge from the dark labyrinths of Barcelona and its history into the light of the future.In this haunting new novel, Carlos Ruiz Zafón proves yet again that he is a masterful storyteller and pays homage to the world of books, to his ingenious creation of the Cemetery of Forgotten, and to that magical bridge between literature and our lives.   Read more  ","['5.0 out of 5 stars', '5.0 out of 5 stars', '5.0 out of 5 stars', '5.0 out of 5 stars', '5.0 out of 5 stars', '5.0 out of 5 stars', '5.0 out of 5 stars', '5.0 out of 5 stars']","['\nRight up there with Shadow of the Wind\n', '\nSpell binding read.\n', '\nGreat literature\n', '\nWonderful\n', '\nOne of the best he has written!\n', '\nLove this author\n', '\nLoved it\n', '\nAmazing\n']","['\n\n  One word: remarkable!

  Everything You Need to Know to Begin Reading Tarot CardsFor centuries, Tarot cards have been consulted for divination by those seeking answers from the unseen realms. The Tarot has been credited with illuminating solutions to major dilemmas, and even helping people avoid future misfortunes. The Tarot experience can indeed be empowering, bringing clarity to confusing situations and showing us that we have the ability to shape our future based on the choices we make in the present. Far more than mere “fortune telling,” the Tarot is a tool for meditation and reflection, for seeing new angles that give way to broader perspectives about how we approach our lives. In this 2nd edition of Tarot for Beginners, best-selling author Lisa Chamberlain opens the door for newcomers to the Tarot in her trademark clear and straightforward manner. She dispels old myths and misconceptions about the Tarot, providing an objective look at its origins and its divinatory potential for 21st-century readers. Tailored especially for those who want to read the cards for themselves, this guide offers strategies for getting familiar with each card, a step-by-step breakdown of the process of a reading, options for tailoring the approach to suit your unique style, and advice for getting the most out of reading the cards for yourself.Most guides to the Tarot are centered on a specific deck, such as the Waite-Smith, the Tarot of Marseille, or other decks ranging from the well-known to the rather obscure. While these books can be useful and informative, their card interpretations are largely restricted to the particular deck they focus on. Tarot for Beginners takes a different approach, offering basic card meanings that can be applied to any deck, and used in tandem with any descriptions that accompany the deck you’ve chosen to work with. So no matter which Tarot deck you use, the information in this guide is relevant, providing a solid starting point for a skill you can carry with you for a lifetime.Foundations in the Art of DivinationTarot can be thought of as a kind of language through which we can hear and understand divine messages. This communication comes through the individual cards and through the symbolic system of the deck as a whole. Tarot for Beginners sets you up to learn this language with a thorough grounding in the key concepts surrounding the Tarot, including: The origins and evolution of the Tarot as a divinatory art A comprehensive overview of the Major, Minor, and Court Arcana Tips for choosing your first deck and getting acquainted with your cards Beginner tips and exercises for interpreting the cards Instructions for the basic 3-card spread and the 10-card Celtic Cross, two of the most widely-used spreads in contemporary Tarot A step-by-step process for conducting Tarot readings Advice on reading the cards for yourselfCore meanings of each card in the standard Tarot deckThe art of Tarot takes time and experience to master, and your willingness to study the cards, practice reading, and hone your intuition will be key to your development as a Tarot reader.

  I have found rock bottom. It's here, moving in with my older brother because I'm too broke to afford to live on my own. It's okay though, because we've always been close and I think I'm going to have fun living with him again.That is until I meet Cooper...Turns out, my brother has very strong opinions on the idea of me dating his best friend and is dead set against it. According to him, Cooper is everything I should stay away from: flirtatious, adventurous, non-committal, and freaking hot. (I added that last part because I feel like you need the whole picture.) My brother is right--I should stay away from Cooper James and his pretty blue eyes. He's the opposite of what I need right now.Nah--who am I kidding? I'm going for it.The Off Limits Rule is a laugh-out-loud, closed-door romance with sparkling chemistry that flies off the page.

It’s funny and gripping, not to mention filled with emotion and romance. It’s a closed door romance, so the most “action” you will read about is a heated kiss, but that didn’t bother me at all. The character development and romantic progression was enough for me.Cooper was a great character. Honestly, I don’t know how anyone couldn’t like him. I enjoyed Lucy‘s quirkiness, but I can see have some people might find it a little over the top. Either way, they seemed to click and compliment each other.Another reviewer commented on how she didn’t think Lucy was a good mother. I can’t say as I agree with the statement at all. I was worried that I wouldn’t like this book on account of the fact that Lucy might come across as something of an absentee, deadbeat mom, but I didn’t find that at all. Just because she allowed other people, such as her mom, to help care for her child didn’t make me think she loved him any less. Not even remotely.I found this book very satisfying and look forward to reading the next book in the series. :-)\n\n', '\n\n  For the main plot of this book to be the MC has a kid, there are quite literally four entire interactions with the kid throughout the book. There was even a nod from the MC that “I’m not some woman who goes and gets knocked up and then leaves her kid with someone else” and that was literally what happened throughout the whole book. In fact, the main thing we learn about is that she has a mom body and that seems to be more important than the kid lol. It’s a short book, I get that. Maybe this plot was too big for 291 pages. This one fell flat, sadly.\n\n', '\n\n  Love Sarah Adams’ sense of humour, quick wit, hilarious writing style. Sweet, clean and heartwarming love story. I’m starting Book 2 now…\n\n', '\n\n  I really enjoyed this book. Several times the characters made me laugh out loud. It was the perfect light read.\n\n', '\n\n  This was so sweet. There were some sassy moments and Lucy was a super relatable mom to a 4 year old. I’m talking ‘can’t be bothered to shave her legs’ relatable, ‘talks about her mom bod and all the joys that come with it’ relatable. I want to be her friend, she seems like my kind of girl.Cooper - heeey Cooper! He’s a pretty swoony, confident without being cocky, hero and I enjoyed the dynamic between him and Lucy immensely.Sarah Adams’ writing style is right up my alley. Easy to read and I love that she breaks down the fourth wall. It’s not Fleabag or The Office levels of talk to the camera but it has the feeling of ‘this is how she talks to her friends’ kind of asides and I was digging it.I will be reading more of her books which is saying something because there was no steam whatsoever. There was swoon and some heated kisses but it wasn’t even closed door because I can’t say if they sealed the deal for sure.If you enjoy Sophie Ranald books, you’ll enjoy Sarah Adams.\n\n', '\n\n  I have to say, that book was so well written and funny. I envy the talent of the author and just for that, and the amazing alchimie between the protagonists, I give  it 5 stars.However, it terms of taste, I\'m not really fond of ""love at first sight because the guy is soooo hot"". The magic, for me, died the first chapters. BUT, knowing the author (""my ennemi"" being one of my favorite book of all time), I knew I was in for a metal ride and I was right!Passing the details about how sexy, and sexy, and hyper sexy was Cooper (with too many descriptions to feel romance instead of lust), the story was amazing. No dramas (I hate dramas!),  Amazing conversations and flirts, and so many funny situations!Did I say I love the author\'s writing? Can\'t wait  to read the story of Jessie!!\n\n', '\n\n  Fa. Bu. Lous. This book was AMAZEBALLS!!! I almost peed myself laughing and wooo! The romance was STEAMING HOT! (But relatively clean. I would say PG-13/behind the secedes level of steam.) This author’s writing style reminds me of Becky Monson’s and Sariah Wilson’s and they are a guaranteed buy for me so definitely in my top favourites list. Pretty much a guaranteed 5 stars read. 100% loved this book and recommend it.\n\n', ""\n\n  I'll admit, these novels and author is a new fav.

He's been mauled by the brothers of Cougar Creek twice (one who brought the fight to him), and now all he wants to do is sleep. Woken early from his winter slumber by the ruckus of whatever those cougars are doing, he tries to do the diplomatic thing and asks them politely to keep it down. They, still hung up on their previous run ins, deny those requests and send him on his way. But a bear has to get even, right? Thinking he's teaching the cougars a lesson, he abducts this sweet smelling little hell cat from their territory, thinking she is the mate of one of the brothers.

  Three books. One completed story. 1500+ pages full of magic, monsters, and forbidden romance—the perfect next read for fans of Sarah J. Maas!A cursed woman.A powerful prince.A forbidden love, and an empire hanging in the balance...Decades ago, the High King of Sundolia waged a war that vanquished the Serpent clan and drove them out of the empire, reducing them to nothing more than legends spoken of in occasional frightened whispers.But they did not leave peacefully. Their parting gift included curses that now rest within the empire’s soil, beneath the shade of its jungles, treading through the waves of its seas. Growing more and more dormant as the years pass under the rule of that increasingly tyrannical high king. Until Alaya—a young woman with a hidden Serpent mark who shouldn’t exist—accidentally wakes one of them up. Then another. And suddenly she finds herself exiled from her adopted village and left with no choice but to seek the truth about her lost clan and the so-called curses they left behind. About her true home. About a power, stolen from the Serpent goddess herself, that is supposedly resting in that home. It is the sort of power that could help her overthrow a king, expose the lies he’s told, and put a stop to his wars.The crown prince of Sundolia claims he wants to put a stop to those wars with her. That he only wants to help her find that power so he can undo the horrors his father has created. All they have to do is find a way to trust each other.But the closer they get to that power, the more complicated the truth—and the trust— becomes. The more dangerous Alaya’s waking power seems. And the more she begins to wonder: Can you still be the hero if you were born a curse?

 Fire & Blood: A History of Mexico ,['T. R. Fehrenbach'], CDN$ 1.99 ,0, ,4.3 out of 5 stars,110 ratings,"
  Mexican history comes to life in this “fascinating” work by the author of Lone Star: A History of Texas and the Texans (The Christian Science Monitor).Fire & Blood brilliantly depicts the succession of tribes and societies that have variously called Mexico their home, their battleground, and their legacy. This is the tale of the indigenous people who forged from this rugged terrain a wide-ranging civilization; of the Olmec, Maya, Toltec, and Aztec dynasties, which exercised their sophisticated powers through bureaucracy and religion; of the Spanish conquistadors, whose arrival heralded death, disease, and a new vision of continental domination. Author T. R. Fehrenbach connects these threads with the story of modern-day, independent Mexico, a proud nation struggling to balance its traditions against opportunities that often seem tantalizingly out of reach.   From the Mesoamerican empires to the Spanish Conquest and the Mexican Revolution, peopled by the legendary personalities of Mexican history—Montezuma, Cortés, Santa Anna, Juárez, Maximilian, Díaz, Pancho Villa, and Zapata—Fire & Blood is a “deftly organized and well-researched” work of popular history (Library Journal).      Read more  ","['5.0 out of 5 stars', '5.0 out of 5 stars']","['\nExcellent History Book\n', '\nEverything you need to know.\n']","['\n\n  Excellent History Book\n\n', '\n\n  This is a great resource which objectively gives a thorough overview of Mexican history.\n\n']"

  “‘A Better Man,' with its mix of meteorological suspense, psychological insight and criminal pursuit, is arguably the best book yet in an outstanding, original oeuvre.” —Tom Nolan, The Wall Street Journal""Enchanting... one of his most ennobling missions."" —Marilyn Stasio, New York Times Book ReviewCatastrophic spring flooding, blistering attacks in the media, and a mysterious disappearance greet Chief Inspector Armand Gamache as he returns to the Sûreté du Québec in the latest novel by #1 New York Times bestselling author Louise Penny. It’s Gamache’s first day back as head of the homicide department, a job he temporarily shares with his previous second-in-command, Jean-Guy Beauvoir.  Flood waters are rising across the province.  In the middle of the turmoil a father approaches Gamache, pleading for help in finding his daughter. As crisis piles upon crisis, Gamache tries to hold off the encroaching chaos, and realizes the search for Vivienne Godin should be abandoned.  But with a daughter of his own, he finds himself developing a profound, and perhaps unwise, empathy for her distraught father. Increasingly hounded by the question, how would you feel…, he resumes the search. As the rivers rise, and the social media onslaught against Gamache becomes crueler, a body is discovered.  And in the tumult, mistakes are made. In the next novel in this “constantly surprising series that deepens and darkens as it evolves” (New York Times Book Review), Gamache must face a horrific possibility, and a burning question.  What would you do if your child’s killer walked free?

It is always a joy to read a new book by Louise Penny, and to be transported to her stellar creation, the fictional village of Three Pines, Quebec and its residents.  I not only appreciate the atmospheric storytelling where I can visualize the place and people, but I want to live there. I feel that I already know the villagers. This is the 15th book set in Three Pines, and the author has maintained her usual high quality. These books are police procedural/mysteries. With each new one, we get further insights into the well-developed characters, with all their strengths and human weaknesses.  Chief Inspector Armand Gamache, a kind and wise man, had been head of the Surete du Quebec. After a high risk and mostly successful police raid, some officers were killed or injured.  Gamache was demoted by individuals who resented his power and risk-taking. His loss was to be their political and professional gain. He is offered the position as head of the Homicide Department, never thinking that Gamache would not to prefer to remain retired in disgrace.  He would now be working alongside, but under the command of his son-in-law, Jean-Guy, whom he once mentored and who he chose as his second-Jan-command. Gamache accepts, only wanting to solve crimes in any capacity. Most who knew Gamache still have great loyalty and respect for him. Powerful forces still resent his return to the Surete du Quebec. Vile postings and a fake video are circulating on the internet deploring his new posting. At the same time, Clara’s recent paintings of scenic miniatures are being reviled on social media, with postings indicating the belief that she never had any artistic talent. Clara is distraught, and her friend, Myrna tries to comfort her. They frequently meet at the inn, and the elderly and foul-mouthed Ruth, a prize-winning poet, is often in the background with her pet duck. She manages to keep things stirred up with her nasty comments.  I regret we didn’t see more this time of Gabi and Oliver, owners of the inn. A catastrophic flood is threatening Montreal and also Three Pines. Most of the police force have been deployed to handle a possible natural disaster. Sandbags are being piled up along the river at Three Pines. A father, Homer Godin is frantic about his missing daughter, Vivienne, who he thinks was on her way to see him. She was married to a domineering and abusive husband, Carl, who did a bit of farming and dabbled in creating pottery.  She was the victim of his beatings and was kept isolated from her father and potential friends.When her body is found it is believed she was escaping the abusive husband and was murdered. She was pregnant at the time of her death, and Carl is the prime suspect.  Jean-Guy heads up the murder investigation. This is to be his final case as a police officer as he is soon moving to Paris to work in the private sector. Carl goes on trial charged with the killing of his wife but is freed due to technicalities.  Homer, her father, is enraged, as Gamache assured him that Carl would be convicted and punished. Homer vows to kill Carl. He is moved into Gamache’s home, with the aim of protecting him from murdering the most likely suspect in his daughter’s death.The pace slows down as Jean-Guy, Gamache and team sit around discussing clues and evidence to order a new trial for Carl. They also ponder other possible suspects, their relationships with Vivienne, possible motives and methods.The murder investigation speeds up with a dangerous, pulse-pounding climax. There are some twists and help from unexpected sources during which a very complex plot is revealed.  Recommended.\n\n', '\n\n  Although this is one of my all time favourite series I don’t think I can rate this as one of the best in the series. While this book includes all the familiar great features of this series like the typical Three Pines weather, the great food and the cozy comforts of the Bistro and the collection of our old friends along with some new residents and “come-from-aways”  it is quite different from any of the preceding books. There are actually three quite separate storylines running here which is not uncommon in this series but in this case they don’t all merge into one finale and in fact I think Clara’s story has really nothing to do with the rest of the stories, didn’t advance the main plot in any way but just slowed down the reading and only served to introduce another new character with hints that she may become a resident of Three Pines. I found the first quarter to a third of this book involving the big flood much slower reading than any of the previous books and appears to be mainly a chance for Ms Penny to get in some social commentary about climate change which is a very relevant and current topic in Quebec at this time. Of course it does provide the setting for the murder and when that happens the whole pace of the book picks up immensely and also it’s not the only social commentary as the main plot involves not one but two abusive husbands. I don’t think I can ever remember Armand and Jean Guy in any earlier book having such tunnel vision and such a strong conviction that they had identified the murderer and spending all their investigation in trying to find evidence against him while ignoring the real killer who I suspected very early although I hadn’t yet figured out the motive so the big climax was no real surprise to me. And that’s more surprising because there were so many other possible suspects and motives thrown in. I think Ruth Zardo is the best character in Three Pines with Rosa a close second and it sure is nice to see Ruth playing such a major role in this episode. The resolution of the smear campaign against Armand came as a bit of a twist but we never learn who “they” are that want him out of the Surete except for the Premier of Quebec. It will be interesting to see where Ms Penny takes Armand and Three Pines now that Jean Guy has moved to Paris. Oh well I guess we have to wait another year to find out!\n\n', ""\n\n  Another incredible twisted murder mystery that affects everyone in different ways...  A so-satisfying story. I couldn't put it down!I wouldn't recommend a reader new to this author/series starting with this book.  There's so much in it, echoes, hints, and crumbs from previous books, all important to understand the magnitude of Gamache's challenges.  Oh my...Highly recommended!!\n\n""]"

  ADVISORY FROM THE AUTHOR:  This novel contains sexual situations and adult content.  It has very little history.  If you like your romance novels to be light on sex scenes and heavy on the history, this isn't the book for you.  It is the sixth and final book in the Kellington series, but it's a stand-alone novel.  To catch you up....the Duke of Lynwood and his four siblings all found love.  Now, it's their friend's turn.When Bow Street Inspector Joseph Stapleton is sent to Oxfordshire to help the daughter of an earl, little does he know how the mission will affect him personally. Lady Evelyn Williams must marry within weeks, but she has never met a gentleman of the ton whom she would even consider as a potential husband.  Then she encounters the brave, handsome man from London.NEVER TURN AWAY is the story of a love that defies society's expectations.  It also introduces Colin Emerson, Lord Ridgeway, whose story is told in ALWAYS COME HOME.

And I have to say, the snippet at the end that Ms. Driscoll actually cut from the book - about how Joseph almost got killed - I wish she had kept that in.  As it is, it just seems a little to tidy that Evelyn was drugged and moved, yet once Joseph and the Kellington's arrive at the house, Ridgeway says he knows where Robert hangs out and when Evelyn is escaping and opens the door, there is Joseph.

But as time passed, David discovered the other side of Thurston Crow, the ex-con with his own code of ethics that justified cruelty, violence, lies—even murder. Intimidating David with beatings, Thurston coerced his son into doing his criminal bidding. David’s mom, too mentally ill to care for her children, couldn’t protect him.Through sheer determination, David managed to get into college and achieve professional success. When he finally found the courage to refuse his father’s criminal demands, he unwittingly triggered a plot of revenge that would force him into a deadly showdown with Thurston Crow. David would have only twenty-four hours to outsmart his father—the brilliant, psychotic man who bragged that the three years he spent in the notorious San Quentin State Prison had been the easiest time of his life.Raw and palpable, The Pale-Faced Lie is an inspirational story about the power of forgiveness and the strength of the human spirit.“Cinematically gripping.”—Kirkus Reviews“Empowering missive about the long shadow cast by an abusive parent.”—Publishers Weekly“For fans of Tara Westover’s Educated, The Pale-Faced Lie . . . is a disturbing yet captivating memoir about how one man’s psychotic delusions can imprison an entire family.”—New York Journal of Books  Read more  ","['1.0 out of 5 stars', '5.0 out of 5 stars', '5.0 out of 5 stars', '5.0 out of 5 stars', '5.0 out of 5 stars', '5.0 out of 5 stars', '5.0 out of 5 stars', '4.0 out of 5 stars']","['\nReally Bad\n', '\nClear your calendar-you wont put this down!\n', ""\nCouldn't put this book down\n"", '\nEXCELLENT BOOK\n', '\nThe Pale-Faced Lie: A True Story\n', '\nPoignant and gripping read.\n', '\nEmotionally gripping\n', '\nGripping Story of  father and son\n']","['\n\n  I started to read this book and thought: ""This can\'t be right"".

  USA TODAY BESTSELLERTessa Bailey is back with a Schitt’s Creek-inspired rom-com about a Hollywood “It Girl” who’s cut off from her wealthy family and exiled to a small Pacific Northwest beach town... where she butts heads with a surly, sexy local who thinks she doesn’t belong. As seen on E!Online, PopSugar, CNN, EliteDaily, Vulture, Buzzfeed, Bustle, the Nerd Daily, PARADE, LA Magazine, Country Living, USA Today, and more!Piper Bellinger is fashionable, influential, and her reputation as a wild child means the paparazzi are constantly on her heels. When too much champagne and an out-of-control rooftop party lands Piper in the slammer, her stepfather decides enough is enough. So he cuts her off, and sends Piper and her sister to learn some responsibility running their late father’s dive bar... in Washington.Piper hasn’t even been in Westport for five minutes when she meets big, bearded sea captain Brendan, who thinks she won’t last a week outside of Beverly Hills. So what if Piper can’t do math, and the idea of sleeping in a shabby apartment with bunk beds gives her hives. How bad could it really be? She’s determined to show her stepfather—and the hot, grumpy local—that she’s more than a pretty face.Except it’s a small town and everywhere she turns, she bumps into Brendan. The fun-loving socialite and the gruff fisherman are polar opposites, but there’s an undeniable attraction simmering between them. Piper doesn’t want any distractions, especially feelings for a man who sails off into the sunset for weeks at a time. Yet as she reconnects with her past and begins to feel at home in Westport, Piper starts to wonder if the cold, glamorous life she knew is what she truly wants. LA is calling her name, but Brendan—and this town full of memories—may have already caught her heart.   Read more  ","['5.0 out of 5 stars', '5.0 out of 5 stars', '5.0 out of 5 stars', '5.0 out of 5 stars', '5.0 out of 5 stars', '2.0 out of 5 stars', '5.0 out of 5 stars', '5.0 out of 5 stars']","['\nAll the hype about this book is true!\n', '\nTHIS BOOK IS THE END ALL BE ALL OF CONTEMPORARY ROMANCE\n', '\nTHE BEST\n', '\nPrice\n', '\nWorth the hype\n', '\nIt’s ok\n', '\nPerfection!\n', '\nMoving to Westport!\n']","['\n\n  Everyone on booktok was talking about this book.

I picked this up because of a tiktok that I saw and at risk of sounding even more dramatic than I already do, this book genuinely helped me realize that I still love reading and helped end a VERY long reading slump.If you love grumpy x sunshine, if you love forced proximity, if you love gruff, wild men, if you love spice (!!!!!!), you will love this book.Now if you haven’t read this yet, be aware, some spoilers ahead!Piper and Brendan are just TO DIE FOR. I love them, I love them, I love them. I was genuinely rooting for their relationship so hard (while simultaneously also wanting Brendan to be mine???And to spoil me rotten???). The character development of each of them individually and also together was so satisfying.Piper is introduced as this ditzy, bratty, stuck-up LA wild child but almost immediately, you start to see layers of her that are so much more than that. Her relationship with Hannah sets the scene for what you’ll be able to see for the rest of the book. She’s fiercely protective of Hannah and loves her completely. The scene where she tries to cook Hannah dinner is such a sweet scene, even if it doesn’t necessarily pan (HA!) out. When you find out that she made space in her luggage, which one can only imagine to be a huge deal for someone as fashionable as Piper, for Hannah’s records, my heart. I’m such a softie for a good sibling relationship. You get to see her develop to so much more and learn so much about her.On the other hand, Brendan is introduced as a total douche (thanks Pipes!). But again, almost immediately you start to see more of him. Brendan helping Piper with the ingredients and instructions for Bolognese, wholesome, my heart. When you learn about his marriage and his wife, so much more comes into view for why Brendan is the way he is.Their relationship is chemistry-ridden, adorable, fiery, incredible, loving, magical, SPICY SPICY SPICY (shall I go on?).I loved, loved, loved reading about these two and I love, love, love how everything turned out.I can’t wait to read about Hannah and Fox in the next book and I also can’t wait to re-read this book a million and one times every time I need a pick me up.\n\n', '\n\n  I was always skeptical about this book. TBut then when I opened it, damn! I cannot put the book down.One thing tho, it would be better if the book was actually as first-person POV and not a third-person POV. Although, it still made an impact and nice delivery of each character’s emotions and stuff.\n\n', '\n\n  Can’t give this a rating, it’s a Christmas gift for m6 granddaughter\n\n', '\n\n  Fantastic story, worth the hype.\n\n', '\n\n  Decent read but got sloppy towards the middle and end. Felt like the last three chapters were just fillers to make the book longer.\n\n', '\n\n  Romcom, opposites attract, fish out of water, the grumpy one falls for the sunshiney one, small town romance, great summer read, there are so many things that could be used to describe this book, but really, it was one word – perfection! Tessa builds a world and tells a story that is so vibrant, so clear, you can’t help but be there with the characters, experiencing everything with them. The attraction, the steam between these two, it snaps and crackles and sizzles. The doubts and fears, they radiate and envelope. The joy and happiness will invade your heart and soul. Piper and Brendan don’t appear to be perfect for each other at the start, but as their story is told, it is apparent to everyone that they are exactly what the other needs <3\n\n', ""\n\n  I don't read a ton of rom-coms and generally only read dark romance but everyone has said such good things about this book that I couldn't help myself.And man am I so glad I did. It was SO freaking good.Piper is externally the typical spoiled rich girl and Brendan is the rugged widowed fisherman who likes things to run predictably. It shouldn't work... but the two of them disrupt each others worlds in the best way.Piper brings the chaos, the sunshine, the magnetism. And Brendan shows her what it is to truly be valued and loved for every single inch of who she is.They each complete and teach each other things that no one else could. It isn't about changing each other - it's about finally being comfortable to be their true selves, especially in Piper's case.I loved their banter, the quirkiness of the town and all of its wonderful citizens.And this is spicy - Tessa doesn't hold back when writing! Piper and Brendan are explosive and passionate and spicy as hell.Loved this book.\n\n""]"

  The instant #1 New York Times bestseller! “It's the best memoir I've ever read.” —Oprah Winfrey“Will Smith isn't holding back in his bravely inspiring new memoir . . . An ultimately heartwarming read, Will provides a humane glimpse of the man behind the actor, producer and musician, as he bares all his insecurities and trauma.” —USA TodayOne of the most dynamic and globally recognized entertainment forces of our time opens up fully about his life, in a brave and inspiring book that traces his learning curve to a place where outer success, inner happiness, and human connection are aligned. Along the way, Will tells the story in full of one of the most amazing rides through the worlds of music and film that anyone has ever had.Will Smith’s transformation from a West Philadelphia kid to one of the biggest rap stars of his era, and then one of the biggest movie stars in Hollywood history, is an epic tale—but it’s only half the story. Will Smith thought, with good reason, that he had won at life: not only was his own success unparalleled, his whole family was at the pinnacle of the entertainment world. Only they didn't see it that way: they felt more like star performers in his circus, a seven-days-a-week job they hadn't signed up for. It turned out Will Smith's education wasn't nearly over.  This memoir is the product of a profound journey of self-knowledge, a reckoning with all that your will can get you and all that it can leave behind. Written with the help of Mark Manson, author of the multi-million-copy bestseller The Subtle Art of Not Giving a F*ck, Will is the story of how one person mastered his own emotions, written in a way that can help everyone else do the same. Few of us will know the pressure of performing on the world's biggest stages for the highest of stakes, but we can all understand that the fuel that works for one stage of our journey might have to be changed if we want to make it all the way home. The combination of genuine wisdom of universal value and a life story that is preposterously entertaining, even astonishing, puts Will the book, like its author, in a category by itself.

However now I don’t like Will. I appreciate that he was so honest in the book, and he has taken an emotional journey. I just don’t care for where he landed. When for the first time he turns down an autograph for a Downs syndrome kid……that was it for me. If Will hasn’t figured out how to pick your spots. Pick your moments. Act graciously. Not all or nothing (like the autograph scenario) - then his journey failed him. I also don’t care for his arrogance. Yes he couches it with “I’m not being arrogant, it’s real fact” kind of,thing, but that jus makes it sound worse. There are ways to validate, protect and realize yourself, with grace and not at the expense of others.  Right after I finished the book I saw on ET that he did some scary stunt in public and I though - “there he goes again, vying for attention”. I find it childish, sorry. I thought he was a better person. I guess his journey to becoming a great person —— will continue…..\n\n', ""\n\n  I have zero complaints about the actual book. Will is am amazing author.

Great story telling, but even swearing outside of quotes I believe are just unnecessary.\n\n"", '\n\n  Overall this is a great choice for anyone who is even a small fan of Will Smith. The book is surprisingly deep covering a number of topics that would not be normally touched on within a typical biography.👍 Pros:✅ Good length✅ lots of great stories and insights into Will’s life✅ Good extra content in form of inspirational words etc.👎 Cons❌ If you are not into “self help” type messages there are some❌ jumps around a bitRecommendation:I would recommend this book to even passing fans of will smith it is great.\n\n', ""\n\n  Will's book touched me by the vulnerability and the genuine description of all these stories in every detail.And it’s written in a way that his journey, challenges, struggles, relationships, successes, failures, losses and gains, prompted me to read it from a place of compassion and extreme respect and admiration for his self-growth and him truly going to the core of his lifelong wound that he needed to heal from.There is one part of the book that really stuck with me, so much that I took a picture and kept it on my phone, so I can go back to it regularly.  Here it goes:“The physics of love and happiness are counterintuitive.  As long as we are stuck in the need to receive - in the cycle of grasping and clinging and demanding that people and the world around us meet our needs - we will be locked into disappointment, anger, and misery.  The sweet paradox is being fulfilled by giving, that your output precipitates the input - giving and receiving become simultaneous.  To love and to be loved is the highest human reward and ecstasy.  Allowing the best within you to serve and unleash the best within others is the most intense of human pleasures.”This book is a must-read for everyone.The self-growth journey is not an easy one, but on the other side of healing lies true freedom.\n\n"", '\n\n  This book is so well written and for me there are several light bulb, life changing moments. I couldn’t put the book down. Will Smith has done it again. This real and honestly raw side of him is even more impressive than the movie star version. I love him even more after reading this book. So welldone!!\n\n', ""\n\n  This book is all about Will Smith & it's very interesting & my wife loves it\n\n"", '\n\n  Hi, I received my book and it is great quality and sounds like a good read but it is suppose to be autographed by Will and isnt.

  Event planner Rachel Persopoulos doesn’t have an impulsive bone in her body.  The one time she threw caution to the wind, she wound up alone and pregnant, just like her mother before her.

But when her boss assigns her a massive Christmas charity fundraiser, she learns the celebrity face of the event is the one person she never planned on seeing again.All-Star catcher Cameron Cole never stopped thinking about the woman who dumped him via text message two years ago—though he never expected to find her coordinating a celebrity bachelor auction.  He’d fallen hard for Rachel, and when she ghosted on him he'd told himself it was for the best.

He believes she is too sweet, innocent and naive to be mixing with him, but Penny is more than a young pretty heiress.The story in The Master of Sin becomes complex as the plot progresses and the links that set up further plotlines for other characters become quite involved, however, I never felt confused. The story is well written and fast paced.The Master of Sin has set up a world of characters that will demand their own stories. The only disappointment I have is that most of the pairings for The Master of Sin secondary characters are fairly obvious.

  Katherine Arden’s bestselling debut novel spins an irresistible spell as it announces the arrival of a singular talent with a gorgeous voice.   “A beautiful deep-winter story, full of magic and monsters and the sharp edges of growing up.”—Naomi Novik, bestselling author of UprootedWinter lasts most of the year at the edge of the Russian wilderness, and in the long nights, Vasilisa and her siblings love to gather by the fire to listen to their nurse’s fairy tales. Above all, Vasya loves the story of Frost, the blue-eyed winter demon. Wise Russians fear him, for he claims unwary souls, and they honor the spirits that protect their homes from evil. Then Vasya’s widowed father brings home a new wife from Moscow. Fiercely devout, Vasya’s stepmother forbids her family from honoring their household spirits, but Vasya fears what this may bring. And indeed, misfortune begins to stalk the village.  But Vasya’s stepmother only grows harsher, determined to remake the village to her liking and to groom her rebellious stepdaughter for marriage or a convent. As the village’s defenses weaken and evil from the forest creeps nearer, Vasilisa must call upon dangerous gifts she has long concealed—to protect her family from a threat sprung to life from her nurse’s most frightening tales.Praise for The Bear and the Nightingale“Arden’s debut novel has the cadence of a beautiful fairy tale but is darker and more lyrical.”—The Washington Post“Vasya [is] a clever, stalwart girl determined to forge her own path in a time when women had few choices.”—The Christian Science Monitor“Stunning . . . will enchant readers from the first page. . . . with an irresistible heroine who wants only to be free of the bonds placed on her gender and claim her own fate.”—Publishers Weekly (starred review)“Utterly bewitching . . . a lush narrative . . . an immersive, earthy story of folk magic, faith, and hubris, peopled with vivid, dynamic characters, particularly clever, brave Vasya, who outsmarts men and demons alike to save her family.”—Booklist (starred review) “An extraordinary retelling of a very old tale . . .

It is my all time favourite series because it is dark, gloomy but shows the human potential. I also love Neil Gaiman, Terry Pratchett......It has the right amount of romance with a perfect twist. The characters were brilliantly described, real and relatable. This book speaks of humanity,  determinism, love and questions the perception of bad and good. I can see that hard core religious people will not like it as it touches on fanaticism, blame and desire. I read reviews that complained about this very subject- that he author gave her ""subjective"" view on religion. HOW dare she speaks her mind and is being critical!! The story takes place in the medieval time of Russia after all. Kathrin Arden beautifully depicts that coexisting with one another is of essence and the price we pay if we choose to not do so. I will definitely read it again.\n\n', '\n\n  An engaging, dark fantasy mired in Russian folklore. It is a fast moving book that captures you, weaves you into the frigid forests of northern Rus’ and delivers an enchanting story line with an irresistibly likeable protagonist. It’s full of magic and monsters, heartache and a dash of romance. The communion with old world Magicks is nearly palpable.\n\n', ""\n\n  I haven't read any other reviews, so I may be repeating what others have already said.What I liked: You can tell that the author did put a fair amount of time into researching the period. I loved the details about the food, medieval Russian iconography, the social aspects of the countryside vs the city, and so on (don't worry, it's not dry at all, just details sprinkled in for flavour). I also enjoyed the way she played with Slavic mythology, and the characterization was generally very well-done - every character had a distinct personality and different and realistic motivations. I enjoyed the fairy-tale aspects, the introduction to the various folkloric entities, and the way the mythological world interacted with the mundane.What I didn't like so much: While there were many tropes present in this story that I greatly enjoyed, the main character, Vasya, came across as a bit of a Mary Sue. It's hard to explain why I feel this way, because the usual traits - for example, everyone loving her regardless of her actions - aren't present. People do dislike Vasya, and sometimes for very good reason. I think it may have been the narrative, and not Vasya herself, that makes me feel this way. She is described often as very fey, strangely alluring, and so on (and she has no idea, of course), in a way that I consciously noticed and pulled me out of the story as I was reading. (There is an important character for whom Vasya is a figure of temptation, and there is symbology and psychology present there to explain his intense feelings, and I actually enjoyed that aspect - it isn't the part that bothers me.) I get that she might be beautiful, and creepy men will absolutely sexualize a teenage girl who is not at all trying to seduce them, but the way the narrative is written implies that Vasya's appeal is factual and not subjective. If it is due to her particular connection to the otherworld, like an aura she projects that gives her this strange appeal despite herself, I hope it is explained in the other books so that I can understand why everyone is apparently being affected by something like a fey glamour.Keep in mind that the above is just a personal pet peeve, but something to look out for if you happen to share it. The book is still a lot of fun, especially if you're interested in stories based on fairy tales, Russian and Slavic folklore, or even the interaction of medieval Christianity with pagan traditions. It reminded me of Naomi Novic's 'Uprooted', which I also enjoyed, but the characters are different enough that it didn't feel repetitive.\n\n"", ""\n\n  Not bad, if you love russian folklore, you'll find some interest, but it's in an old school style. Meaning, the heroine is a girl and well, everybody try to control her. It's kind of historical, I know it's the point, but it would be nice for a change that the family of the girl is actually on her side ... Anyway. Still, there is amazing character (I'm not gonna be a spoiler). The author make great references for anybody who know at least a bit of russian and it is well written. Quick read, it's nice, but probably one time was enough.\n\n"", '\n\n  Excellent! The story reminds me of being a child and disappearing into fairy tales. Strong heroine with none of the swooning foolishness of so many women in fantasy novels... the final scene is riveting! Looking forward to more from this author!\n\n', '\n\n  Great easy read...makes a great beach read! I don’t know much about Russian folklore but you really don’t need to in order to enjoy this story. The author does a great job of explaining certain words in a glossary at the end of the book..which I found helpful. The characters are great and I felt the story progressed at a good pace. Overall great read. This is also book 1 of a trilogy which I’m looking forward to reading.\n\n', '\n\n  Beautiful book. First time reading fantasy genre and I reay enjoyed this. Great characters. Perfect for a cozy winter night\n\n', '\n\n  Arden has created a delightful and engaging fusion of fiction and folklore, vividly set in the raw beauty of a harsh environment that juxtaposes the cycles of nature with the forces of life and living, and dying and death. The heroine is grounded within herself and learns the strength that comes from refusing to allow fear to overcome courage.\n\n']"

  Now available in one collection, four classic crime thrillers from the award-winning “French master of noir” (Observer)Unravelling like a paranoid nightmare, Bird in a Cage melds existentialist drama with thrilling noir to tell the story of a man trapped in a prison of his own making. Crush is a chilling 1950s suspense story of youthful naivety, dark obsession—and the slippery slope to murder. The Executioner Weeps is the winner of the 1957 Grand Prix de Littérature Policière. And The Gravedigger's Bread is a claustrophobic thriller about love gone wrong. All from the French master of noir.In Bird in a Cage, trouble is the last thing Albert needs. Traveling back to his childhood home on Christmas Eve to mourn his mother’s death, he finds the loneliness and nostalgia of his Parisian quartier unbearable. Until, that evening, he encounters a beautiful, seemingly innocent woman at a brasserie, and his spirits are lifted. Still, something about the woman disturbs him. Where is the father of her child? And what are those two red stains on her sleeve? When she invites him back to her apartment, Albert thinks he’s in luck. But a monstrous scene awaits them, and he finds himself lured into the darkness against his better judgment.Crush: Bored with her mundane factory job, her nagging mother, and her alcoholic father-in-law, 17-year-old Louise Lacroix is captivated by a glamorous American couple who moves to her industrial hometown in Northern France. The Roolands' home is an island of color, good humor, and easy living in drab 1950s Léopoldville—a place straight out of Louise’s dreams. Louise is thrilled when she successfully convinces the couple to hire her as their maid. But once she is under their roof, their model life starts to fall apart. Painful secrets from their past emerge, cracks in their relationship appear, and a dark obsession begins to grow. In The Executioner Weeps, it was fate that led her to step out in front of the car. A quiet mountain road. A crushed violin. And a beautiful woman lying motionless in the ditch. Carrying her back to his lodging on a beach near Barcelona, Daniel discovers that the woman is still alive but that she remembers nothing—not even her own name. And soon he has fallen for her mysterious allure. She is a blank canvas, a perfect muse, and his alone. But when Daniel travels to France in search of her past, he slips into a tangled vortex of lies, depravity, and murder. The Gravedigger's Bread: Blaise should never have hung around in that charmless little provincial town. The job offer that attracted him in the first place had failed to materialize. He should have got on the first train back to Paris, but Fate decided otherwise. After a chance encounter with a beautiful blonde in the town post-office, Blaise is hooked. He realizes he'll do anything to stay by her side, and soon finds himself working for her husband, a funeral director. But the tension in this strange love triangle begins to mount, and eventually results in a highly unorthodox burial.   Read more  ",[],[],[]

She was so annoying that I kept having to take reading breaks or else I would have thrown my e-reader across the room.I really liked Leon though (except for his name… what kind of badass demon is named “Leon”?! Might as well have named him Kevin or Bob). He was psychotic, ultra possessive, sadistic, and sweet in his own twisted way — in other words, he was perfect! The smexy scenes were mostly hot AF. I just wasn’t a huge fan of one scene where Leon slapped Rae across the face several times, but otherwise the smexy times were scorching hot!

  This “gripping” New York Times bestseller from the host of CNN podcast Behind the Desk tells the true story—and backstage drama—of late-night comedy (Los Angeles Times).   When beloved host Johnny Carson announced his retirement after thirty years on The Tonight Show, millions of Americans mourned. But inside the television industry, the news ignited a battle between two amazing talents—Jay Leno and David Letterman—who both yearned to occupy the departing legend’s chair. For NBC, it would be a decision with millions of dollars at stake. Soon these two comedians with strikingly different styles, who had once shared a friendship as they worked the clubs together, would be engaged in a fierce competition for the prize.   Based on in-depth reporting and interviews with those involved, and updated with a new introduction by the author—a producer of CNN series The Story of Late Night—The Late Shift is a “vivid, behind-the-scenes, blow-by-blow account” of the fight that ensued, as stars, agents, and executives maneuvered for control of the most profitable program in TV history (Chicago Tribune).   “Remarkably gripping . . . Takes us deep into the bizarre high-stakes world of broadcasting . . . A powerful story, and ultimately a sad one, filled with casualties as well as winners.” —The New York Times Book Review   “Solid reporting, based on extensive interviews with the principals, lifts The Late Shift into a class of its own. . . . The insights into the people involved are what make [the book] a page-turner.” —Orange Country Register  Read more  ","['4.0 out of 5 stars', '3.0 out of 5 stars', '5.0 out of 5 stars', '5.0 out of 5 stars', '5.0 out of 5 stars', '5.0 out of 5 stars']","['\nPretty anti-Leno, but..\n', '\nThought I was getting an authentic hardcover but was a ...\n', '\nThe Battle For Late Night\n', '\nGreat Book\n', '\nFive Stars\n', '\nFive Stars\n']","[""\n\n  Of the 2, I'm a Leno guy more than a Letterman guy, and the book is very anti-Leno.

While each story was set in different time periods and unique to the author’s style they all flowed together wonderfully.Legacy of Love by Kristi Ann HunterThis story hooked me right from the beginning with the matchmaking grandmother. I had to laugh at her antics and the way that Randall and Sarah tried to avoid them. I quickly came to care for each character.Gift of the Heart by Karen WitemeyerThis was such a sweet story. Ruth is determined to provide for her daughter and will give whatever needed to do this. Bo agrees to the plan she has presented but wants to stay in the background. I absolutely loved the way that Ruth befriends Bo and helps him learn to become more comfortable around others. The interactions between Bo and Ruth’s daughter, Naomi, were delightful.A Shot at Love by Sarah Loudin ThomasFleeta was a girl with a set plan in place and that plan does not include allowing a guy into her life. However when Hank and Fleeta meet there is instant attraction, neither can stop thinking about the other. Fleeta fights the attraction and tries to move ahead with her plans, but when things take a turn for the worse Hank comes to her rescue and her opinion of allowing him in her life changes. I loved how supportive Fleeta’s family was of her dreams.Because of You by Becky WadeThis was my favourite story. I loved that this story tied in with Becky Wade’s series, the Bradford sisters. Maddie works with Britt and has feelings for Leo but feels like she can let them known. When these two are teamed up together for a Christmas project they end up spending quite a bit of time together and Leo begins to see Maddie differently. Their story is story of healing and moving forward and contained so much depth I was not expecting in a novella. I loved these two and it was easy to root for them to come together.

If this hot little bombshell gives his new toy a glowing review, he knows it's ready to go into production. Most people might think working as an adult toy reviewer is a dream job. But Muriel Geist is just faking her way through it. Still, she's shocked when she's denied the holiday bonus due to a poor performance review from her supervisor at Kringle Knotty or Nice Intimates. She can't go home to her younger siblings, empty-handed for another Christmas. Luckily, when she turns to head out the door, she finds she's standing face to face with tall, dark, and hot Mr. Saint Nick, himself.

The book starts in the present, four years after the last time they spoke to one another.  They used to be best friends who met every summer at a hockey summer camp, but Wes walks away from the friendship when he realizes he has feelings for his friend Jamie, who is straight.The book is about the two finding each other again, and rebuilding their friendship.  But it's also about them falling in love, and discovering what it means to be with one another.  It is a m/m romance, and that matters only because Jamie is discovering his sexual identity in this book.  But honestly, it is a romance novel, and I don't think it needs to have any gender or sexuality descriptor.I love the way Wes and Jamie are with one another.  At the heart of their love story is their friendship, and you can see how much they care about and support one another.

  INSTANT NATIONAL BESTSELLERNEW YORK TIMES BESTSELLERWINNER of the 2021 Banff Mountain Book Prize in Mountain Environment and Natural HistoryWINNER of the National Outdoor Book Award for Natural History Literature A world-leading expert shares her amazing story of discovering the communication that exists between trees, and shares her own story of family and grief. Suzanne Simard is a pioneer on the frontier of plant communication and intelligence; she’s been compared to Rachel Carson, hailed as a scientist who conveys complex, technical ideas in a way that is dazzling and profound. Her work has influenced filmmakers (the Tree of Souls in James Cameron’s Avatar), and her TED talks have been viewed by more than 10 million people worldwide. Now, in her first book, Simard brings us into her world, the intimate world of the trees, in which she brilliantly illuminates the fascinating and vital truths—that trees are not simply the source of timber or pulp but are a complicated, interdependent circle of life; that forests are social, cooperative creatures connected through underground networks by which trees communicate their vitality and vulnerabilities with communal lives not that different from our own. Simard describes up close—in revealing and accessible ways—how trees, living side by side for hundreds of years, have evolved; how they perceive one another, learn and adapt their behaviors, recognize neighbors, and remember the past; how they have agency about their future; how they elicit warnings and mount defenses, compete and cooperate with one another with sophistication: characteristics previously ascribed to human intelligence, traits that are the essence of civil societies. And, at the center of it all, the Mother Trees: the mysterious, powerful forces that connect and sustain the others that surround them.Simard, born and raised in the rain forests of British Columbia, spent her days as a child cataloging the trees from the forest; she came to love and respect them and embarked on a journey of discovery and struggle. Her powerful story is one of love and loss, of observation and change, of risk and reward. And it is a testament to how deeply human scientific inquiry exists beyond data and technology: it’s about understanding who we are and our place in the world. In her book, as in her groundbreaking research, Simard proves the true connectedness of the Mother Tree to the forest, nurturing it in the profound ways that families and humansocieties nurture one another, and how these inseparable bonds enable all our survival.

It explores new and emerging science of how trees communicate and share resources, and exposes the industrial forestry mentality and the flawed volume-based 'free to grow' policy that the BC Government has foisted on the public for decades. The net result is overharvesting, numerous mills closing, 1,000s of kms of degraded riparian habitat, glyphosate spraying of deciduous trees and >1,000+ people arrested protesting old growth logging at Fairy Creek. Meanwhile the multi-national forest companies slip away to their southern US based mills where they have tree plantations (not forests) and cheaper labour and leave the degraded forests to the public to restore.Thank goodness there are scientists like Dr. Simard to expose this!\n\n"", '\n\n  Excellent read on the subject of forest ecology and the role of fungi in forming significant connections among trees in forests.

  WINNER OF THE 2021 SCOTIABANK GILLER PRIZENATIONAL BESTSELLER From the widely acclaimed author of American War: a new novel--beautifully written, unrelentingly dramatic, and profoundly moving--that brings the global refugee crisis down to the level of a child's eyes.More bodies have washed up on the shores of a small island. Another over-filled, ill-equipped, dilapidated ship has sunk under the weight of its too many passengers: Syrians, Ethiopians, Egyptians, Lebanese, Palestinians, all of them desperate to escape untenable lives in their homelands. And only one has made the passage: nine-year-old Amir, a Syrian boy who has the good fortune to fall into the hands not of the officials but of Vanna: a teenage girl, native to the island, who lives inside her own sense of homelessness in a place and among people she has come to disdain. And though she and the boy are complete strangers, though they don't speak a common language, she determines to do whatever it takes to save him. In alternating chapters, we learn the story of the boy's life and how he came to be on the boat; and we follow the girl and boy as they make their way toward a vision of safety. But as the novel unfurls, we begin to understand that this is not merely the story of two children finding their way through a hostile world, it is the story of our collective moment in this time: of empathy and indifference, of hope and despair--and of the way each of those things can blind us to reality, or guide us to a better one.

As a bestselling romance novelist and influential bookstagrammer, she’s fine with getting her happily-ever-after fix between the covers of a book.But right now? Not only is Kara’s best friend getting married next week—which means big wedding stress—but the deadline for her next novel is looming, and she hasn’t written a single word. The last thing she needs is for her infuriating first love, Ryan Thompson, to suddenly appear in the wedding party. But Ryan’s unexpected arrival sparks a creative awakening in Kara that inspires the steamy historical romance she desperately needs to deliver.With her wedding duties intensifying, her deadline getting closer by the second and her bills not paying themselves, Kara knows there’s only one way for her to finish her book and to give her characters the ever-after they deserve. But can she embrace the unlikely, ruggedly handsome muse—who pushes every one of her buttons—to save the wedding, her career and, just maybe, write her own happy ending?""A fun and sexy romp, with chemistry that gave me all the feels!"" —Jennifer Probst, New York Times bestselling author of Our Italian Summer""Add this book to your TBR list immediately!"" —Sarah Smith, author of Faker  Read more  ","['5.0 out of 5 stars', '4.0 out of 5 stars', '4.0 out of 5 stars', '4.0 out of 5 stars', '5.0 out of 5 stars']","['\nFun rom com\n', '\n4.5 stars!!

Her best friend is getting married, so she has that stress on top of her work. Before the wedding, Kara meets the groom’s best friend, who happens to be Kara’s ex-boyfriend, Ryan. Ryan was Kara’s first love and they had a devastating break up ten years ago. Now, Kara and Ryan are thrown together in the wedding planning. Spending time with Ryan actually gives Kara inspiration for her novel. Since Kara is finally making progress on her book, she decides to give Ryan a second chance to make their own happily every after.This was such a sweet and emotional romance. I could relate to Kara as a writer. She had written books in the past but she was struggling with her current idea. Sometimes, you just need the right inspiration to keep moving forward. Ryan was the key to finishing her novel. She used the formula of a romance plot to guide her relationship with Ryan, to hopefully make it last this time.Since this was a romance novel, I knew something would happen to divide Kara and Ryan before they could show their strength and become a real couple. Ryan seemed like a dream guy to me, especially since he could discuss romance novels with Kara, which made what he did almost unforgivable. I was so heartbroken for Kara, and I don’t know if I would have forgiven Ryan. I was glad that the story picked up and had a happier, romantic ending.Talk Bookish to Me is a fun bookish rom com!Thank you HarperCollins for providing a copy of this book in exchange for an honest review.\n\n', '\n\n  This is an phenomenal debut! I absolutely loved this book! The Bookstagram references were just added brownie points! I thought the storyline was very fun and unique. The characters were amazing and I ended up rooting for them hard. This book was witty, fun and steamy (all the things I love in a rom-com)! The only thing I didn’t enjoy as much was a 20% portion near the end of the book (I don’t want to ruin anything so I won’t go in details but it kind of felt like a different book altogether). Overall, an excellent read! The writing was great and I will definitely seek out this author’s future books!Thank you to the publisher and NetGalley for providing a free advanced copy of this book in exchange for an honest review.\n\n', '\n\n  TALK BOOKISH TO ME by KATE BROMLEY*Special thanks to #NetGalley and Harlequin Trade Publishing - Graydon House Books for a free, electronic ARC of this novel in exchange for an honest review.*Opening on an energetic note, we’re introduced to our main character, Kara Sullivan (an historical romance novelist, facing blank-page angst after the success of her first novel - with a deadline looming and not a word written she needs a muse fast!). She is arriving at her best friend’s pre-wedding party…  – and just what is a pre-wedding party you ask?  well, it’s  …”basically a casual reception days before the mega-reception.” Kara Sullivan, Talk Bookish to Me.She and her BF discuss the upcoming nuptials ever so casually, and how one of her fiancé’s old friends is standing up with him and that he knows our MC from college. Enter Ryan Thompson. The one person Kara never expected to come face to face with, especially after a 10 year lapse. This is NOT a serendipitous meet cute, oh no – this is a kick in the gut, breath-stopping shocker of a re-meeting; and what does her so-called best friend do?.. but disappear and leave her to deal. Sarcasm and hilarity ensue as these two are forced together time and time again due to wedding revelries [including *gasp* even ‘shacking up’ due to the antics of an overzealous mutt!] and they realize they have some unfinished business.Waffling between hurt and anger and the comfort of a once familiar love, the pattern of fighting and flirting that develops has Kara super confused, but to top it off it ignites her creativity. Uh oh!Could Ryan be the muse Kara so desperately needs or the target {read motive} behind her murder trial?I enjoyed this book immensely. I especially liked how caring Ryan was concerning Kara’s career, the witty, and oft times sarcastic banter between them [I laughed out loud! Not something that happens with many books proclaiming the ‘com’ surname – they seriously lack in the comedy department.] and how well-developed all of the characters were. Despite the some-what predictableness of the plot (oh! But that twist at the ending!) the pace was just right and the humour was on-point with just the right amount of steam.A great beach read under a huge umbrella with a cool beverage!4/5H Little\n\n', '\n\n  Talk Bookish to Me is a heartwarming, witty tale that takes you into the life of the hardworking Kara Sullivan as she juggles her best friend’s wedding, a looming deadline, a mother with high expectations, and an unexpected visit from the one man whom she’s never quite forgotten.The prose is smooth and crisp. The characters, including all the supporting characters, are multilayered, endearing, and amusing. And the plot is a tender, engaging mix of life, love, loss, family, awkward situations, delicious chemistry, romantic drama, tension, introspection, and an adorable bulldog with a penchant for bathrooms, and surprisingly Celine Dion.Overall, Talk Bookish to Me is a charming, smart, uplifting debut by Bromley that I thoroughly enjoyed and is the perfect choice for anyone who loves their romcoms with a lot of heart, hope, humour and heat.\n\n', '\n\n  Kate Bromley, I am now hopelessly devoted to you. This book has ruined me for all rom-com’s in the foreseeable future. The dialogue was hilarious, the characters were extremely likeable, and the story was unpredictable.  I found myself re-reading lines, just so I could enjoy them a second time.  Kara and Ryan, your story is a permanent addition to my bookshelf.\n\n']"

  National Book Award Finalist:  An account of the disease that ravaged eighteenth-century Philadelphia, written and illustrated for young readers.   1793, Philadelphia: The nation’s capital and the largest city in North America is devastated by an apparently incurable disease, cause unknown…   This dramatic narrative describes the illness known as yellow fever and the toll it took on the city’s residents, relating the epidemic to the social and political events of the day and eighteenth-century medical beliefs and practices. Drawing on first-hand accounts, Jim Murphy spotlights the heroic role of Philadelphia’s free blacks in combating the disease, and the Constitutional crisis President Washington faced when he was forced to leave the city—and all his papers—to escape the deadly contagion. The search for the fever's causes and cure provides a suspenseful counterpoint to this riveting true story of a city under siege.   Winner of multiple awards, this thoroughly researched book offers a look at the conditions of cities at the time of our nation’s birth, and draws timely parallels to modern-day epidemics.   “A lavishly illustrated book, containing maps, newspaper columns and period illustrations…unflinchingly presents the horrors of the event as well as its heroes.”—The New York Times    “Pair this work with Laurie Halse Anderson’s wonderful novel Fever 1793 and you’ll have students hooked on history.”—School Library Journal   “History, science, politics, and public health come together in this dramatic account of the disastrous yellow fever epidemic that hit the nation’s capital more than 200 years ago.”—Booklist  Read more  ",['5.0 out of 5 stars'],['\nSuperb\n'],"['\n\n  Finally, a great nonfiction book written for children.

No one can forget how his time as their Alpha had ended. Add in the troubles they’ve had since he’s left, and I know what Heath expects.

The story is fast-paced, fun to read, and filled with amazing fight sequences. If you enjoyed the first two volumes, then this sequel will not disappoint.High stakes are present throughout the book, making the reader incessantly turn the pages to find out what happens next. In the occasional pauses from all the fights, meditation, and self-improvement, there are some exciting interactions and development of characters previously flatly enacted—Thea and Billy. The giant is without a doubt my favorite character. While being impossibly blessed with talent he also possesses a crippling disadvantage in intellect, and his special condition and personality are excellent deliverers of light-hearted moments and dark contemplations.Zac's future path of advancement was briefly hinted at in the previous volume and is further approached in this one, presenting all the individualities and possibilities his unique condition can mature into. However, this would not be a cultivation novel if there were no new powerups, dangerous encounters, and treasures discovered. This book will not disappoint in that regard.Even if the protagonist is building up into an indisputable powerhouse, there are always threats able to end his journey. It is this feeling of mystery, wonder, and apprehension that makes this story so fun to read and hard to put down once started. However, I was still a bit disappointed about the lack of development in the peculiar situation between Zac, his ex, and Alea—it is only briefly discussed, mostly in introspections, and choices affected by the lack of trust and increasing paranoia birthed from their traumatic event. It is a bit of a letdown, but since I was not expecting the story to focus on romance, it can be overlooked and hopefully addressed in future volumes.Book three ends with a lot of promises, new threats, and opportunities that make clear the improvement in both storytelling and plotlines since the story began. I'm, honestly, very excited to read what is to come and how will Zac's unique path change him in the long run. Defiance of the Fall is all a cultivation novel aspires to be and is definitely among the best ones out there.\n\n"", ""\n\n  The main character is great, he is relatable, the pacing is perfect, characters make sensible choices, none of the conflict due to misunderstandings that is so common in fiction.

  NEW YORK TIMES BESTSELLER • Pulitzer Prize winner Elizabeth Strout explores the mysteries of marriage and the secrets we keep, as a former couple reckons with where they’ve come from—and what they’ve left behind. ONE OF THE TEN BEST BOOKS OF THE YEAR: Maureen Corrigan, NPR's Fresh Air • ONE OF THE BEST BOOKS OF THE YEAR: The New York Times Book Review, The Washington Post, Time, Vulture“Elizabeth Strout is one of my very favorite writers, so the fact that Oh William! may well be my favorite of her books is a mathematical equation for joy. The depth, complexity, and love contained in these pages is a miraculous achievement.”—Ann Patchett, author of The Dutch HouseI would like to say a few things about my first husband, William. Lucy Barton is a writer, but her ex-husband, William, remains a hard man to read. William, she confesses, has always been a mystery to me. Another mystery is why the two have remained connected after all these years. They just are. So Lucy is both surprised and not surprised when William asks her to join him on a trip to investigate a recently uncovered family secret—one of those secrets that rearrange everything we think we know about the people closest to us. What happens next is nothing less than another example of what Hilary Mantel has called Elizabeth Strout’s “perfect attunement to the human condition.” There are fears and insecurities, simple joys and acts of tenderness, and revelations about affairs and other spouses, parents and their children. On every page of this exquisite novel we learn more about the quiet forces that hold us together—even after we’ve grown apart. At the heart of this story is the indomitable voice of Lucy Barton, who offers a profound, lasting reflection on the very nature of existence. “This is the way of life,” Lucy says: “the many things we do not know until it is too late.”   Read more  ","['4.0 out of 5 stars', '1.0 out of 5 stars', '4.0 out of 5 stars', '5.0 out of 5 stars', '4.0 out of 5 stars', '5.0 out of 5 stars']","['\nLove Strout’s writing\n', '\nNothing happens\n', '\nA lovely follow up on Lucy Barton\n', '\nAll.

William has discovered that he has a long-lost relative his mother had never previously mentioned. The pair go on a trip to try to reconnect with this newly found relative.This book is a short one - it’s comprised of two chapters and is told entirely from Lucy’s perspective. It’s easy to finish in one sitting. There is not much plot, but it was nice to float along with Lucy’s narrative.I thought there were some great insights on childhood trauma and how the effects of that can carry on into adulthood. One example is how Lucy’s abusive upbringing left her uncertain on how she was supposed to behave “correctly” in her new social sphere as an adult.The second half of the novel is when I became invested in Lucy’s story. Lucy's relationship with William after their divorce was both sweet, funny, and slightly painful.Overall, I enjoyed this conclusion to the Amgash series.

Now William’s third wife Estelle, with whom they have a young daughter, is unhappy with him and moves out.Leaning on each other for support, William invites Lucy on a fact finding trip with him about his past and that of his mother who has passed.I admire the way Strout captures real life. She doesn’t sugar coat how people speak or feel. For example you can still love someone and have them totally piss you off.The writing always draws me in and I come out of my reading time thinking about the lessons that the characters live by.Thank you to @netgalley and @penguinrandomhouse for this ARC in exchange for my honest opinions.

  Canada's beloved comic genius tells his own story for the first time. What is Rick Mercer going to do now? That was the question on everyone's lips when the beloved comedian retired his hugely successful TV show after 15 seasons—and at the peak of its popularity. The answer came not long after, when he roared back in a new role as stand-up-comedian, playing to sold-out houses wherever he appeared. And then Covid-19 struck. And his legions of fans began asking again: What is Rick Mercer going to do now? Well, for one thing, he's been writing a comic masterpiece. For the first time, this most private of public figures has turned the spotlight on himself, in a memoir that's as revealing as it is hilarious. In riveting anecdotal style, Rick charts his rise from highly unpromising schoolboy (""Rick still owes 15 dollars to the chocolate bar fundraiser"" was one of the less brutal items on a typical report) to heights of TV fame, by way of an amazing break as a teenager when his one-man show, ""Show Me the Button, I'll Push It. Or, Charles Lynch Must Die,"" became an overnight sensation—thanks in part to a bizarre ambush by its target, Charles Lynch himself. That's one story you won't soon forget, and this book is full of them. There's the tale of how little Rick stole a tree from the neighbours that's set to become a new Christmas classic. There's Rick the aspiring actor—hitting the road as a new young punk in a vanload of hippies and appearing on stage in Shakespeare—and a wealth of behind-scenes revelations about This Hour Has 22 Minutes, Made in Canada, Talking to Americans and the coming of the mega-hit Rick Mercer Report. It's a life so packed with incident and laughter we can only hope that a future answer to ""What is Rick Mercer going to do now?"" is: ""Write volume two.""

She comes up with algorithms to predict customer purchases—a job that has given her more money than she knows what to do with, and way less experience in the dating department than the average thirty-year-old.It doesn't help that Stella has Asperger's and French kissing reminds her of a shark getting its teeth cleaned by pilot fish. Her conclusion: she needs lots of practice—with a professional. Which is why she hires escort Michael Phan. The Vietnamese and Swedish stunner can't afford to turn down Stella's offer, and agrees to help her check off all the boxes on her lesson plan—from foreplay to more-than-missionary position...Before long, Stella not only learns to appreciate his kisses, but crave all of the other things he's making her feel.

The Kiss Quotient had been sitting on my TBR list for far too long.I love novels that portray characters with realistic traits.  I’m never on the hunt for that ideal character or couple who epitomizes perfection.  I want to connect with the characters, feel for them, cheer them on, and adore them.  I adored Stella and Michael.Stella is an econometrician.  Numbers are her jam.  While she is a highly successful, career-minded woman, her dating life is less than stellar.  With a mother who “badgers” her about getting a boyfriend, Stella knows that she could use some instruction in the dating and intimacy department.  So, what’s a woman to do but hire a professional escort to show her the ropes.Michael has his reasons for being an escort.  His pretty face gets him enough clients to serve his purpose.  He’s a mixture of gentleman, bad boy, dirty talker, and all-around good guy.  Stella was unlike any of his other clients, but that suited him just fine.  Stella chose Michael because he was pleasing to the eye, but he ended up being so much more.  He was kind, patient, and considerate to her.  For him, it wasn’t a chore to be all of these things to Stella, he truly enjoyed being around her.You can tell from the synopsis that this book is going to have some steamy parts, but the chemistry between these two main characters is off the charts.  I enjoyed witnessing the interactions between Stella and Michael.  The business arrangement that they agreed upon mixed with all of the time that they spent in close proximity to one another created the perfect recipe for romantic tension.There was so much to like about The Kiss Quotient.  Helen Hoang has created a fascinating cast of diverse characters that I immediately liked, especially Michael’s boisterous family.  While the book does contain a lot of steamy scenes, there is so much emotion, heart, sensitivity, growth, and acceptance among the characters.I’m already looking forward to reading Khai and Quan’s stories!\n\n', ""\n\n  “How did one not obsess over something wonderful? How did one like something a reasonable amount?”OKAY, I read this in one frickin day and while I'm super glad I did because I loved it, I also wish I would have savoured it???? I'm also so mad at myself for taking this long to read it because i LOVED IT SO MUCH.The Kiss Quotient is different and fun and it's the perfect mix of sweet and spicy!! Michael and Stella are just SO gah both together and apart. I'm obsessed with both of them!! I really appreciated the representation both of Asian POC and of high-functioning autism. And well TOGETHER THEY ARE JUST amazingggggg. I love them together. Michael was so sweet and kind with her and I thought that a lot of his actions (especially in comparison to Phillip's) displayed a really important conversation about consent which I super super appreciated. I loved loved his backstory and loved getting to know him through that backstory.This is just such an incredible, adorable read and I cannot wait to devour every other book in this series as soon as possible. If you need me, you can find me reading the Bride Test!!!“All the things that make you different make you perfect.”\n\n"", ""\n\n  HIGHLY RECCOMEND READING THIS BOOK! This book is amazing I'm so glad it exists. It was such a good read, there really wasn't a dull moment!The story of a woman with autism navigating the world of relationships and sex whilst having sensory sensitivities and difficulties in certain social areas, (all varying depending on where you are on the spectrum and who you are as an individual), is a real life struggle for people who have autism. It is so important that society becomes less stigmatized and stops alienating people with developmental disabilities. People with a developmental disability have a right/need for love just as any neurotypical person does! It's great to see a story including someone who is neurodivergent, written from their perspective, and on top of that written by an author who is autistic herself, who's has done further research on autism, and other women's experiences to help form this story. It just makes the book that much better; it's more authentic.As a DSP just starting in the field, seeing change in society around stigmas with such developmental disabilities is a passion of mine and this story was so cool. Normalizing life experiences specifically around romantic experiences for people who have a developmental disability is really important and I look forward to a day where society isn't so harsh on uniqueness.It's important to understand that every human being has a right to relationships and every other right a person may have regardless of neurological state and especially if that person is an adult.All in all, I'm so glad I came across this book and that it got published! I'll be looking for other reads from this author, I'm a sucker for romances and this book hit the spot! :)\n\n"", ""\n\n  This book was fantastic. It's unique in that it is written from the perspective of a Vietnamese-American autistic woman who hires an escort to help her with her intimacy issues. The characters are well developed and makes your root for them! It does follow the reverse Pretty Woman storyline and it's a great read!\n\n"", ""\n\n  Like all of her books, this author knows how to tell a really cute story. I like her Asian characters, (there aren't very many books with Asian mcs in it). The story was good and the characters were great. I never felt like there was a dumb misunderstanding in the plot. Someone's, in stories like this, there's some sort of badly made up misunderstanding that causes a huge blow up and I can't stand those. This story was great. Would recommend this author\n\n""]"

No one writes enemies to lovers romance like Tracy Lorraine.Please note. There is a prequel to this book where our FMC and MMC meet in a graveyard. Please read that small novella first. Its steamy and sets you up for the entire first book in the series.Stella has been moving around the USA with her dad going from school to school for as long as she could remember. With her father, she’s moved to England to finish off high school. One night, she met a stranger in a graveyard and they shared a moment. Little did she know, that stranger holds a lifetime grudge against her. When Sebastian discovers that the woman he met in the graveyard is the daughter of his sworn enemy, he makes it his life’s mission to destroy her. The story takes place at an elite academy where both Stella and Seb are finishing off England’s version of high school.Like I mentioned above, Tracy knows how to write enemies to lovers romance books. What I appreciate most about her writing style, is she doesn’t depict the woman as weak in body of spirit. Stella is a woman who trains MMA daily. She knows how to defend herself and won’t let anyone harm her. Growing up travelling from city to city with her father, she’s used to the solitude and isn’t afraid to be shunned at school.I would say that this story is higher on the spice scale. I find that the main couples sexual preferences contribute to the spice level or the book. There are many descriptive kink scenes which involve knife play, exhibitionism, voyeurism, spanking, and choking.I enjoyed the pace of the story. It wasn’t too fast that you felt like there were pieces missing to the plot line. It also wasn’t too slow that you found parks dragging on. The story does end on a cliffhanger.I was provided an advanced reader copy in exchange for an honest review.\n\n', '\n\n  This book was wicked and so much more! I was so excited to finally get Stella’s book and Tracey Lorraine did not disappoint. I loved every second of this book and I really didn’t want it to end. The banter between Stella and Seb is amazing and I couldn’t get enough. Stella shows no fear when most would cower and shake and enjoys keeping all of the boys on their toes. Seb is all kinds of possessive and dominating.“Right, well, as fun as this little catch-up has been. I’ve got better things to do with my time.” I drop my eyes down his body, my gaze locking on his crotch. “And I’m sure you need to go and ice your balls.”This is the first book part of the Knights Ridge Empire series. This is Stella and Seb’s story and it is a trilogy. I loved this book but I can not wait for the next one because the cliff that I just fell off hit me hard and I need more!!If you do not like dark and twisted this is not the book for you but if you do this is a must read!!I have received a free copy of this book for an honest review.\n\n', '\n\n  DAMN! This is one hell of a dark, twisted and sexy story! It’s definitely an angst filled bully romance that will keep you glued to the pages. The intense hatred, pain and anger thrown around could be felt on every page. It will make you grit your teeth and shaking your kindle. The story is explosive from beginning to end!Stella and Sebastian are like oil and water, a bit toxic and filled with hatred for one another. But the chemistry they have is so intense and ready to combust that it will have your toes curling, your heart beating fast and keep you squirming on your seat. These two take drama and depravity to a whole new level.Fantastic story with phenomenal writing. What a way to leave us readers shocked and gasping for breath at the end! My jaw is still on the floor! I am all shook up! WTF!\n\n', ""\n\n  If you loved the prequel, Wicked Summer Knight then you are absolutely gonna flove Wicked Knight. Stella is my main woman. Like my ultimate, hands down girl crush! Forget that she is my book girlfriend. Forever and Always! She is such a badarse! Seb and Stella have amazing hate chemistry. She takes it as good as she gives. Like this girl is solid. I can't wait for the conclusion to their story. It is sexy and seriously one of my fave enemies to lovers read this year if not ever! Stella owns my heart and Seb has stolen my panties!! An epic read and my new fave by Tracy Lorraine!\n\n"", '\n\n  What a great start to this series!!!! .

However, many aspects of her life are controlled, and while she enjoys more freedoms than other women in the Mafia, she still only lives in a golden cage. People would rather see the princess of New York fail than succeed. Tired of this life, Marcella Vitiello makes a decision that could ruin the perfect image she created for herself over the years. Soon after, Marcella will learn to appreciate her protected Mafia life. On her own, she will need to put all her trust into Maddox White, a member of the Tartarus MC and who hates everything related to the Vitiello name.I believe this book will be one of these books that people will either like or dislike. However, I absolutely enjoyed the book and believe it is a must-read for every Cora Reilly fan. Lately, all books that I have started reading could not keep me interested for very long, and I would not finish them. But By Sin I Rise got me out of my reading slump. I was interested in the story and was unable to put the book down.I loved the main characters. Mercella Vitiello is the perfect heroine in my eyes – strong, independent, proud, focused, driven, determined, and passionate. She is not a damsel in distress but rather a complete badass walking around in designer clothes and Louboutins. She is not impressed by the men around her and won’t settle for less than she deserves. She is her father’s daughter in every aspect and is more than capable of becoming a part of the Mafia business. From the beginning, it is clear that the biggest mistake that one could make is to underestimate her. And Maddox, well, Maddox was a very refreshing character and just really sweet. How could one not like him?Marcella and Maddox are connected by a lot more than just mutual attraction, which I enjoyed. Cora Reilly made sure to develop their relationship slowly. Marcella and Maddox understood and opened up to each other. However, their loyalties were tested repeatedly.Marcella and Maddox set the tone for the Sins of the Fathers series and high expectations for the other couples we will meet in later books. I am looking forward to Part 2, and December cannot come fast enough.Get ready to meet some of your favourite characters again, new characters that we have been patiently waiting for, and most of all, get ready for a book that will keep you captivated and interested until the very last page and will make you crave for more!As usual, Cora Reilly outdid herself!***This ARC was kindly provided to me by the author in exchange for an honest review.***\n\n', '\n\n  Intense and passionate characters with a dark and captivating storyline.

I loved the action and how well the story flowed.\n\n', '\n\n  Really enjoyed the journey it flowed very well and was great from the beginning, with everything moving towards a great entire story.\n\n', ""\n\n  This series just keeps getting better from one book to the next!The Queen’s Executioner: 5 StarsSeriously what can I say about book one of the Magelanders series? It is most certainly a great start to a epic fantasy story. In this world there are different species of people. Each has its own traits such as being compared to frogs, lizards, apes... and each species has their own specific breed/class of mages from rock, fire, vision.. Christopher Mitchell gives each its own unique characteristics related to their species as well and I loved how seamlessly they’re added in.The Queen’s Executioner refers to Sheila who is a high flow mage. In her homeland they suffer from monotony, overcrowding and general dissolution of life. Her sister decides to set off in a great migration and names herself Queen. We get to follow their peril filled journey and the struggles they face in both the decisions they make as well as actual physical danger.We also get to follow some other characters along the way. We have Daphne who starts off being exiled from her homeland and mislead by her ‘friend’. We watch her grow into her magic as a vision mage while she explores the different facets of it.Then there’s Laodoc who starts off in a position of great power. His personal growth is probably the most defined of everyone and he’s got so much inner strength even when his sons abandon him.We have our main three Kellach. Killop who seems to have a predetermined fate he can’t resist, Kallie who feels abandoned and betrayed and Bridget who’s trying to hold them all together.There are other characters along the way, some you will love and some you will love to hate. We are transported between different POV’s and storylines but it doesn’t feel choppy. The events are all happening parallel to each other or directly after and it’s interesting to see the buildup to where the lines may eventually merge in future books. Even though this is a fantasy world many of the struggles faced are ones our current world faces like overcrowding, famine, war and crooked politicians. I look forward to seeing where this series goes next.The Severed City: 5 StarsThe Severed City is the second book in Christopher Mitchell's Magelands epic. It picks up directly where the last book left off. We gain a better understanding of Keira, the fire mage and her motives. She is reunited with Kylon not long after escaping her captivity. We get to follow her and her unlikely troop of 'leftovers' while they are either making a splash in the combined war effort or trying to keep things low key and escape.Killop meanwhile has taken lead as chief of the Severed City. His goal at first is simply to free his people but he makes some unlikely allies along the way. His character arch seems to shift the most in this book as he seems to loose the kind heart we've seen before. You can't overly fault him in this as he's been lied to about something huge.Daphne travels to Plateau City where she's given a royal pardon for her past actions. Ladoc is with her for awhile as is our water mage. Not everyone seems to be welcoming though and there is a bit of drama in her home estate. Nothing's easy, especially her pregnancy.With the five races in this world we gain a better understanding of the forest dwellers. I was surprised at how severe they were. Not all of them came across this way but they showcased more savagery than the other races this time. In general this story doesn't shy away from the ugliness of war or how people find themselves doing things they couldn't even imagine themselves capable of.There's quite a bit of setup and foreshadowing happening. Most notably wondering who's really pulling the strings. You can't help but feel almost everyone is being manipulated and I can't wait to see who's really the chess master.If you love a good fantasy epic then give Magelands a try. You will need to read book one otherwise you'll be lost.Needs of the Empire: 5 StarsWe are once again transported into this world. The characters all have rich personalities and each is unique. There is a description of the races at the start of the book including which type of magical abilities each possesses. This can be very helpful as a refresher if it's been awhile since you read the past books. I would recommend reading this series in order, you would have a hard time following the storylines which are rather complex of you start here.Needs of the Empire takes place a little bit after The Severed City. Keira has already built up and leading the army to try and take down the Empire, they seem quite an unstoppable force as they match towards the capital. Kylon has a bit of a character shift into a darker place.Meanwhile Daphne and Killop are reunited. Their daughter has powers nobody can even imagine. They try and settle into life together at least until Ladoc asks for help. It seems the Old Free aren't very happy their slaves were freed and their trying to take back the city.Sheila is bored in her life as an ambassador but her own government is willing to give her a crown. We even get to see a bit of her family again. It's not a happy reunion but then I doubt anyone expected one.Christopher Mitchell continues to seamlessly weave all the separate parts and paths of this story leaving the reader fully immersed. I though more than once I knew how things would happen but I was so very wrong! Be prepared for a few twists and turns you never see coming.Sacrifice: 5 StarsThis was a great conclusion to the Magelands epic. The title “Sacrifice” really says it all. We follow around the central characters who are working on coming together, even if they don’t realize it.Keira is dealing with the fallout  and tries to push away anyone who wants to get close, mostly because she doesn’t want to endanger anyone.The Holdings is in revolution trying to overturn the Empire and the Hold Fasts are the leaders in that.

Jesse was such an adorable darling—Drew is right that Jesse is easy to love. Drew is awesome too. He understands that he can’t ignore Jesse’s challenges, yet he needs to remember that Jesse is an adult too, capable of making his own decisions. It was intriguing to watch Drew balance taking care of Jesse’s needs, and respecting Jesse’s intelligence and dignity as a human being: to protect Jesse without babying him.I appreciated the point in the book that different people on the autism spectrum have different struggles; there is no generalizing across the ASD community.Jesse was so cute as well when he interacted with animals. Drew mentioned that Jesse was like a child, in that he’s full of youthful vitality, but he isn’t a child per se, as he’s an adult who can take care of himself. So Jesse is child-like but not a child.Drew’s ex was scary; I honestly don’t understand why Drew would even like that guy in the first place. Jesse is obviously a thousand times better both as a partner and as a person.Jesse once raised the question of why some guys like to insult a guy by calling him a girl. True. I don’t see girls insulting a girl by calling her a boy. Very misogynistic indeed.It was astonishing to me that there was virtually no homophobia in the story. Parents, relatives, coworkers, waiters, sales clerks, and others were all very supportive of gay people. This is a pleasant surprise, since I’m so used to seeing terrible homophobic family, friends, or acquaintances. It’s so nice to see this environment where being gay is normalized and accepted. The discrimination that Drew and Jesse faced, was actually towards Jesse’s ASD and ID (intellectual disability), and people’s implicit belief that allistic folks cannot have autistic partners, which is bull, of course. Autistic folks are just people, like everyone else!There was one part where characters discussed whether autistic people can have a “normal romantic relationship.” Drew and Jesse’s answer to this question was a resounding yes. While there are different levels of functioning in ASD individuals, I would agree that in general, yes, it’s possible to have a happy, healthy relationship with someone, even if the couple has to deal with some extra challenges; for example, dealing with prejudice from others.On having autism, I liked how they talked about stimming, which is a self-stimulating gesture (e.g. stroking fur on an animal or a stuffed toy) to calm oneself in the midst of a chaotic world. Jesse also talks about sensitivity to bright lights, loud noises, and other things. I’m glad to read about these, because the sensory sensitivity part of autism isn’t as talked about in wider society, compared to the more “famous” autistic traits, like having difficulties in understanding social cues, and having an obsessive focus on one or a few domains of interest. In addition, it was pleasing to read about an autistic hero who doesn’t fall into the savant or genius stereotype.One of my favorite things about Jesse’s Smile, is the concept of not being “less intelligent” or “bizarre,” but of being different in the way one processes and interacts with the world. It’s a part of natural human diversity to be hyper-sensitive to certain textures, and to desire great order and regularity, among other dispositions. We don’t all have to process and make sense of the world in the same way.The book had an interesting talk about nature, nurture, and personality too. Would Jesse still be himself if he didn’t have ASD, ID, OCD, and dyslexia? Or do these conditions all contribute to making who Jesse is as a person? The nurture piece was thought provoking as well. As the characters put it, Drew had every opportunity handed to him, while Jesse had every opportunity taken from him, though both boys were blessed with loving, supportive families. Jesse and Drew grew up to be sweet and caring people themselves.As for their career success, there was one discomforting moment where their salaries are compared. High school English teachers don’t make a ton, but their income still exceeds that of a pet shop assistant. Some characters in the book pointed out the contrast in their “social stations,” and questioned whether their relationship will work out in the long run. Yet, even though the job of a high school English teacher requires more education, that doesn’t mean that it’s a superior job to a pet shop assistant’s. Moreover, characters do acknowledge later on that the two are so in love, more in love than most couples are, in fact.The references to fandoms like Doctor Who, Star Wars, and Guardians of the Galaxy were entertaining to read. I loved how Drew was a little jealous of Captain Jack from Torchwood: What does Captain Jack have “that a bespectacled English teacher doesn’t?” That made me laugh.Generally, I find it interesting how romance heroes tend to find their partner super beautiful, but would also find an actor very gorgeous. I’ve read some romances as well where they distinguish between the “actor” kind of handsomeness, and the real life kind of wonderful looks. (Perhaps the difference is that actors have professional make-up artists, costume designers, and camera-people to make them look as fabulous as possible. Not that that’s a problem.) In Jesse’s Smile, Drew likened Jesse to a model on the cover of a magazine. As for Drew, many of his students are in love with him. So in romances, I see a few different types of beauty: the actor, the model, the real-life beauty, and the wildly popular pretty boy. (N.B. The actor/ model is not necessarily more beautiful than the real life types. I have some friends in real life who, in my opinion, are even more stunning than an actor!)Drew said that his book on modern poetry only sold about 60 copies. Well, I think that 60 copies are quite a lot for a book that is neither fiction, on a popular topic, nor a required textbook. (If it were a required textbook, he would easily sell at least hundreds of copies.) Drew joked that his mom probably owns 50 of these, but he was clearly just kidding.A final thing I loved about this book, is the adoration and respect towards animals. Several of the animals are referred to by their names instead of by their species, and the human characters frequently include them in their lives and conversations.All in all, a wonderful book!\n\n', ""\n\n  5 starsJesse's Smile is a standalone book. It's about Jesse Peterson, a 26-year-old man who has some challenges and Andrew Oliver, a 34-year-old English teacher. While everyone is quick to assume Jesse can't function alone, Drew helps him grow and treats him as any other young man. Two very different men fall in love to form an amazing couple.Jesse has to be my favorite character hands down. Even with all his challenges, he is smart, sweet, compassionate, amazing with animals and pure (mostly). He is such a unique character with such depth. We honestly do not have enough autistic characters. While he is high functioning, I really did learn a bit about autism.Drew is a very good man. I love that he could look above all Jesse's challenges and love him how he is while not trying to change him. Yes, he did change Jesse but not for own designs but to help Jesse grow as a man.This book was amazing. I laughed and cried and will definitely read it over and over again. It's such a hidden gem. In M/M we do have books with characters who have challenges but we have very few that have such extensive challenges as Jesse and it shows people that they can love too. to not give up on people you do not understand. Amazing work on this book and I can only hope we will see this couple again.*** Copy provided to Bayou Book Junkie for my reading pleasure, a review wasn't a requirement. ***\n\n"", '\n\n  Incredible book.  Ms. Jurd has written an absolutely beautiful story that includes a gamut of emotions coming at the reader from all sides, making us become part of the story.  The plot is engaging, the dialogue is on point, the characters could not be any more likeable, and the mental health issues are so well woven into the story that like Drew, we cannot help but love Jesse just the way he is, no more and no less.  I absolutely loved how the author obviously researched the mental health aspects of Jesse’s personality and became quite knowledgeable about them but she never made the book into a clinical study or a bragging/teaching platform.  She was happy with presenting things and letting readers come to their own conclusions.  I’ve seen so many books where authors fall into the trap of trying to show off their newfound knowledge and make the book almost into a mental health manual.Excellent read, enjoyable, entertaining, and so full of that special quality that makes you feel warm and gooey inside.\n\n']"

Lara is shipped to Ithicana where she expects to hate her cruel husband but she discovers a dangerous and wonderful land, ruled by a kind but fierce king and she soon realizes that her father may have not told her the truth about the situation in Maridrina and Ithicana.I really loved this book. The characters are great and there are chapters from Lara's and Arren's point of view. The romance is present, but smooth and sweet in a realistic way. The politic plot to ruin Ithicana is also a big part of the story and I really liked the way that Lara is struggling because she does not know who to help and who to trust, she is not easily swayed just because the king is young and pretty.There is a lot of action and the ending is awesome!\n\n"", '\n\n  An amazing story that I didn’t want to end!

I read the first 3 chapters of “drivel” skimmed the rest and returned it for a refund. Do your self a favor and don’t bother.\n\n', ""\n\n  Where does Sally Rooney go now? In 'Beautiful World, Where are you?' a novel more of conjecture than story, the main character Alice, debates the worth of novels themselves. What does it mean, Alice asks, when you write novels about first world characters, their angst, their preoccupations and struggles, in a world going to hell in a handbasket? She does not use the handbasket cliché because she's too good a writer, with far to firm a grasp on language to write anything quite so obvious, but her conundrum is the conundrum of the obvious. What is novel for and what is the worth of a novelist involved herself and her own petty problems? That Rooney is a novelist writing about a novelist just makes these questions more poignant. Alice, who, like Rooney is successful, asks if she will be able to write again or at least to write fiction again. Will Rooney or will the weight of the world grind her down? If that is a cliché too then it's a cliché the novel is intent on dealing with and in a broader context asks what does art matter? If, indeed, what Rooney and Alice, her alter ego, are doing is 'art'. Yes, it is and the interweaving of the the email debates between Alice and her best friend Eileen, a junior literary editor, with their personal stories: Alice's affair with Felix, a working class warehouse worker and  Eileen's with the politically committed Simon and Eileen's and Alice's own complex friendship make for a reflection both on whether such a novel of manners means anything and whether its concerns are material in the broader scheme of things. The novel nods gently in the direction of an answer that, in fact, the preoccupations of love and life in middle class Ireland have an importance because they are important to the people who have them. Us. That love is important and so are friendships and honesty and attempts to deal with the wider context. Alice wonders about these matters as clearly does Rooney; by expressing them she produces a novel that is worth reading for what happens to the characters and for what it says about what we talk about today and what we should be thinking about even if we cannot solve the problems we see.\n\n"", ""\n\n  I've read Rooney's three books. She's a good writer, and Normal People was particularly well done. But it felt like she wrote 'Beautiful World' to meet a contractual obligation or just because of heavy publisher pressure. Through her central character Rooney is processing the discomfort and ambivalence she feels about her real life success. But for all her skill, she gives no fresh nuance to that discomfort.But then maybe that's intentional. Through much of the book, Rooney keeps the reader outside any of her characters' heads, describing their reactions rather than letting us in on how they actually feel. (Was Normal People like that? I am going to have to re-read parts of it to compare.) There are parts of 'Beautiful World...' where two characters exchange deeply thought emails, but the end result is still a remote perspective.I will very likely read Rooney's next book, if she writes another, but I hope she can be a little less moan-y about the trials of success there and either find an interesting take or\n\n"", '\n\n  When I read Sally Rooney’s first novel, I was impressed by the deceptive simplicity of her easy flowing prose, and her ability for excellent dialogues. With her second one, where she showcased the same maturity and depth of understanding of human nature as in the first one, I declared myself a fan. And after reading this one, her third, I still am. The beauty to be found lurking underneath her writing in some utterly brilliant chapters, as well as the uncanny way in which, with an economy of words, she can convey the depth of feelings or the telling crudeness of a situation, are second to none. Alas, there are some passages in this one that were not entirely to my liking, as I found them verging on political pamphlet rather than genuine reflections. However, invariably, each time I had one of these hypercritical moments, a few lines later I was once again enthralled by her writing.\n\n', ""\n\n  To be honest, I am struggling to finish this book.  I most likely will not.  The storyline is pretty much nonexistent and the characters are weaker yet - they are adults carrying on like they're teenagers.  None of the four are likeable.  In fact, the way the dialogue is presented, often in the form of emails to one another, it is difficult to discern if there's any substance to them at all.  To be sure, there are too many great books to be read and enjoyed, to waste one's time on the likes of this one.  (The one star is rating is for the colourful cover design, by the way.)\n\n""]"

Toward the middle-end part, it started dragging on a bit where I felt like some parts were getting a bit repetitive in what was happening, but this is the type of story that still pulls off the ""slow burn"" type of pace. In the end, I felt like I still had one big question that makes it more of a Happily Ever After for now, but not in a cliffhanger sort of way.Looking forward to more of this series!\n\n', ""\n\n  Loved this book. So much I could barely put it down to sleep, and I picked it right back up when I awoke. I love me some apocalyptic darkness, throw some romance and getting it on in between and I'm 100% satisfied. I've read some of the other reviews about the gruesomeness of the plague and I have to wonder, what were people expecting? This is Pestilence, the plague. Yes, children die during a plague. It's not pretty or romantic and it certainly doesn't do an about face the moment he sets eyes on a human bent on killing him. But the author does a convincing job detailing Pestilence's transformation. The baby steps it takes, the resistance and the fear involved in change. She does the same with Sara seeing through her own perceptions to really see Pestilence and what he's endured, not just what he was sent to do all while questioning her own existence and humanity.Looking forward to delving into the next book as well as her other series.\n\n"", ""\n\n  This book was not at all what I expected. The violence of the world was such an effective tool in the love story between Pestilence and Sara. I fully expected a primarily physical attraction, but this is an emotional growth love match. Their relationship begins with violence and intolerance and blooms into tenderness and empathy.I loved that it begins in Whistler, BC. When you know a setting well, it's easier to become immersed in the world and focus on the characters.My heart felt full at the end of this book, and I will be happy to continue the series. I'm hopeful that the author will continue to surprise me with the depth of her characters.\n\n"", '\n\n  I don\'t often write reviews but I found Pestilence to be a powerful story. I connected with Sara, the strong female main character. I also appreciate that she is Canadian. Bottom line...I had a very hard time setting my tablet aside and read well past when I should have gone to sleep. There were times when I found that I had tears rolling down my cheeks, the story was that compelling and the main characters have so many obstacles to overcome. If you don\'t like stories that create strong emotions, this book won\'t be for you.As for me, the only drawback is that (at the time that I\'m writing this review) this is a fairly new release and the other two books, War and an as yet unnamed third book, are not complete so I can\'t binge read this series! Fortunately Laura Thalassa has other books available and I\'ve started the first book of ""The Bargainer"" series. So far, so good! ;)\n\n', ""\n\n  Really enjoyed this book. I loved the MC's character developments + how much they both struggled with their inner dilemma of how they felt for one another even though they were mortal enemies. Lots of action, lots of violence + it certainly isn't for the faint of heart but this story is very very good. I did remove one star only because I thought the last few chapters before the epilogue dragged for me but damn, this book is highly entertaining + the characters just grow on you.\n\n"", ""\n\n  While this was a hesitant purchase on my part, it took a very long time to get into it. The characters were irritating for the majority of the book, but once they finally pushed for a relationship it was both amusing and slightly dramatic/comical. Only once their relationship was rolling did the kindle appeal more to me. 4 Stars goes towards the 2nd half of the book, where they work together and discover his plan isn't the right thing to do. Suffer through the start and you'll enjoy the rest.\n\n""]"

Now under attack by enemies both known and unknown, Piper has little choice but to flee her refuge—and start over in a place few vampires ever go.

He was warring against demons. Against the silence that was threatening to swallow him. And I had kept a secret from him, one he would never forgive me for.But my secret was about to be ripped open. Displayed for the world on national news. And I had only one way to repair the damage.I had to trust the man I lied to.The man I never got the chance to make a life with.The only man who could save what we had created together.Review:There's something about the first boy that kisses you, that is your first experience and is your first love that you never forget. They will always be special and no matter how hard you try, you find yourself comparing the future lovers to the very first, wondering who was the best and never really able to come up with an answer. In Warrior, Olivia and Ben have known each other for years, Ben being Olivia's brother's best friend, but the more they spent time together, the more they couldn't deny their attraction and eventual love between each other. They knew they had one single night before Ben had to leave for a year on an overseas military tour. What neither ever expected was a gift left for them - a gift that Olivia has tried to tell Ben more than once that she had through email, but devastating circumstances forced him to simply delete each and every one of them without reading them. On his return, his demons follows him and Olivia's life is threatened: Ben can't sit idly by to watch her get hurt, and decides to be at her side, discovering the gift.As another novel appears containing a veteran who comes home and suffers from unimaginable nightmares and the worst kinds of injuries, I wondered how Nicole Blanchard would be able to make Warrior stand out from the pack and make itself known among its category. Then, when I kept reading, I found out why this author, who until now I hadn't read any of her books yet, had a novel that is full of emotion and shows the dark side of the effects of having to live through the horrors of a war zone and the way she can put so much details into one steamy scene that will surely make your heart pound or at the very least have you wanting to fan yourself. I've enjoyed watching Olivia and Ben's relationship evolve and my emotions went through the wringer as I 'sat' and read all the obstacles they had to go through to be able to be together once again. This is one novel that I'd recommend to readers who are looking for that one book that will have them going through a wide variety of emotions and that 'sigh' worthy ending.Review Copy of Warrior provided by the Author, Nicole Blanchard for an honest Review.Reviewed by Kathleen from Alpha Book Club\n\n""]"

I found all of the characters to be really immature, especially the lead male character. He came across as an entitled sixteen year old.

And, the repetitiveness of the ""omg (s)he loves me, how can (s)he love me?"" Nearly every page!If you\'re going to write in first person, then understand how to do it. Who thinks to themselves, ""I need to talk to my father, Roger, today."" Don\'t you know who your father is, what his name is? We don\'t say our father\'s name when we\'re thinking about him because we already know it! That\'s just one of the many, many cases of mistakes like this.

I adored Mr. Masters and I’ve been hoping for this to turn into a series but I didn’t hear anything but luckily I happened across Mr. Spencer.  I didn’t even know it was out or coming out but happy I came across it.  I absolutely enjoyed reading this book.  I love the story between Spence and Charlotte.  It swayed and trickled slowly as they became more and more aware of their feelings.  Some unexpected turns.  This is TL Swan at her best.  My only criticism and one I’ve seen others also write is the bold for used for the H’s POV, in this case - Spence.  Many readers used the Bookely font in the US and Canada and the dark, extra large, bold type is so distracting and difficult to read that every time I read Spence’s POV I had to change it to the Caecila font just so I could read it. It distracted and annoyed me.  I hope the author considers this request.  Most authors just use a sub heading with the name of the POV - we are used to that but the dark bold font is incredibly difficult and hard on the eyes.  As for the story, well done - and I look forward to more. 😘\n\n', ""\n\n  It took me longer than normal to finish this book, because the drama these two main characters created in their relationship could only be read in small doses. They were both immature and their emotions swung from very hot to very cold at a moments notice. I ended by disliking them both so much. They deserved each other, and not in a good way.Another thing that drove me crazy was the extreme overuse of the verb ' smirk'.

Although better to read in order and all characters connected, this can be read as stand alone. However for better enjoyment, I suggest to read in order as the epilogue of this book close the circle.Each book starred a brother. 4 kids who were saved by a man. 4 kids who were not brothers by blood but became brothers because of this man.Last book, hawk storie is very emotional. It is about recovery a terrible childhood and domestic violence and rape. From a man point of view (POV), from a woman POV and from a kid POV… Heavy topic to include in a romance, yet you can be very much insured that the author was very sensitive and kept all precautions to develop her story with anything that could trigger some of you, I personally didn’t read any gory or horrible details. It is written with a profound respect and knowledge. It is referred but never fully describedThis story is of course romanced but it is also a message of hope. That’s how I feel after reading it.This said, as usual, I found myself smiling, crying, teary, dreaming all long my reading. Cherise Sinclair is extraordinary to bring a wagon of emotions. It is a long book and I love her for it. Each chapter is a slice of everyday life, knowing, understanding, sharing characters life, love and struggles. And more.More because Cherise Sinclair always add a solid plot in between. It doesn’t overpower the love story but it add something in the story.Plus, she added kids. And like real life she added an adorable 4 years old kid who will find a happy ending.The 4 books that compose this series are just best buddies romances you want to read and re-read. Even writing this review, I still have this smile on my face from the pleasure this author gives me… every single time. There is no BDSM whatever in this series. Just contemporary with ex army guys who fell hard for their woman (and kids).The sad part is that now I will have to wait few months for the next book to be published. Cherise Sinclair is a great author and an automatic read.\n\n', '\n\n  Well, that took me on a wild ride that had my heart pumping and my adrenaline spiking! Then it had my heart melting and happy tears welling as the legacy of Mako settled in deep. This is Hawk’s story, the most closed off of the men. The one who doesn’t think much of himself because life has taught him that, and then reinforced it, from the very beginning. The man who is a part of something, yet still feels detached. The one who started out with baggage and still carries it. This is also the story of Kit and Aric. They have been damaged and traumatized. Abused and belittled and learned to stay off the radar because of that. Catalysts for the change that is coming over their lives, and in danger because of that. These three will invade your heart, make is sing, make is hurt, make it swell, and make it contract. As they work through what is part of them, they learn to rely on each other, become part of each others lives, and they learn to love themselves, and thus, each other. This is a family forming, part of it intact and strong, another part just having those first tendrils reaching out. This is a man and a woman figuring out how to re-learn reactions and learning about each other while doing so. It isn’t an easy path for any of them, but the results of their efforts are all the more beautiful because of it. I simply loved this book, the characters in this series, and this amazing conclusion to it all <3\n\n', '\n\n  Amazing story that i am sad is over!!  I love how these 4 foster brothers are able to rise above everything and find a family amongst themselves and find true love to boot!! Lots of drama, some abuse but in the end there is always love and this amazing couple Hawk and Kit find their HEA!!  Go grab this series and enjoy this fabulous ride!!

I\'d recommend it to anyone, even if you\'re only 16 in high school, you will not look back. It\'s written in a way that is incredibly easy to understand, which is effective in my opinion for reaching more people who may be apprehensive about this area of finance.

The angst took up much of the story it was hard to catch your breath and I still felt a bit raw after I finished.

His cool head and detachment had served him well during his military career; then later with matters pertaining to both branches of the Gallo family business.  I was quite surprised then to discover the depth of the emotional and soul-deep connection he shared with Simone when they were 21 and 18 respectively.  Simone was a sweet, kind and dutiful daughter, raised in an affluent family by parents who had mapped out all aspects of her life.  I was glad when she finally stood up for herself, expressing her opinions and her desires.This well written romantic suspense is told through dual POV’s during the period when the H&h first meet, and when they reconnect, nine years later.  I didn’t find the romance particularly dark – at least not when they first met, but there were definitely some darker undertones to their explicit encounters once reunited.  There’s plenty of drama, conflict, angst, suspense, plus some betrayal, danger and violence.  It was fun seeing Dante’s siblings – Aida, Seb and Nero, as pre-teens/teens as they interacted with Dante and Simone.I received a free copy of this book via Booksprout and am voluntarily leaving a review.\n\n', ""\n\n  This is book four in the Brutal Birthright series.

When the King decrees no lady may get married until after Laurel her already strained relationship with the others becomes even worse. In this court the gossip and snide comments are done in the open, there's no hiding the malice.When newly widowed Brodie Campbell comes to court to seek audience with the king he runs into Laurel's brother Monty and hears of her plight. Being a bit deep in the cups Brodie sees Laurel as an interesting challenge and says as much. Soon there's wagers flying around the tavern betting on Brodie's chances.There's a lot that went into this story. Their connection at court is just the beginning of this love story. These two have passion and a deeper personal connection that transcends the pages they grace. Their love story is full of action, drama and scandle.

It's has some elements of Taming of the Shrew in it. This is my favorite part they are so sweet. The second part is what I'll call adventure part.

Brodie Campbell sees Laurel for who she truly is under her prickly demeanour and wishes to take her as his wife. Winning her trust will not be easy, not to mention the conniving goings on, the less than friendly ladies at court, and the troubles at home.

" The Minimalist Budget: A Practical Guide On How To Save Money, Spend Less And Live More With A Minimalist Lifestyle ",['Simeon Lindstrom'], CDN$ 5.16 ,1,  Best Sellers Rank:  #406 in Kindle Store (See Top 100 in Kindle Store)   #1 in Budgeting & Money Management (Kindle Store)  #6 in Budgeting & Money Management (Books)  ,4.0 out of 5 stars,284 ratings,"
  “Budget"" - it's a meager little word, one that all too often comes after “tight”...Maybe you think of this word as an adjective, something to describe a cheap and substandard car or hotel. “Budget” brings to mind rationing, a kind of money diet. If you're like many people, budgeting is something you do with a kind of deflated spirit: budgeting means bargain bin quality and the sad sense that what you want is going to be just out of reach.This book will try a different approach to budgeting altogether...This book will offer an expanded notion of what it means to budget. We'll look at how money is not the only resource that needs to be managed, and a “life budget” that acknowledges your emotional, behavioral, social and even spiritual capital is more likely to lead to smarter decisions.We'll explore shopping and spending habits, identify problem areas, think about debt and make achievable goals for home, work and more. We'll look at concrete ways to put some of these principles into action, and look at resources that will keep you focused and motivated. At the same time, this book is also about the philosophy of minimalism, not thriftiness. If you can pair your budget plan with a more nuanced understanding of your relationship with money and how it ties into how you want to live, the changes you make will be more authentic and longer lasting.Minimalism is not about doing with less than you need. Rather, it's about finding what you need and fulfilling that need exactly, without excess. It's a subtle and easily overlooked point: to have exactly enough is not suffering. Budgeting is therefore about understanding what you need to have enough, and how best you can allocate your resources to that end.Life is short. Money and material things can make our time on this earth better, and they can help us move closer to what we find meaningful and worthwhile. But they are not meaningful and worthwhile in themselves. Money is a tool and how we spend it is an expression of our values and what we think is important. How much would you pay for peace of mind and the calm you get from knowing you are living well? How much of your life do you give away when you work? Of all your expenses, have you remembered to include the time you waste stressing about money?These may seem like vague or overly philosophical questions, but they get to the root of how we earn, spend and think of money. Once we understand these roots, our efforts to save here and there not only become easier, they become more meaningful.

Normally I don’t do this because my memory tends to be like Dory.

I want some answers and I thought I was getting some but the author basically just laughed and gave us even more mysteries. Not impressed (I need answers now).I enjoyed watching the dynamic of this group of characters evolve and change over the course of the book. I know it’s going to completely change and evolve again with the rest of the series. What you think you know about the characters, you don’t really know. I feel like we were learning a lot but it was only snippets of, potentially, something bigger. Although, the same goes for the characters within the story. They are learning a bit more about each other but they are keeping a lot of secrets. Secrets of that could potentially blow up and change everything. Oh the drama and suspense, I love it.I would recommend reading this book with a friend so that you have someone to bounce your theories off of. As an added bonus, you can suffer together. Book 3 is already pre-ordered.\n\n', '\n\n  Honestly I expected better.  The story just went to pot in this second part, all that nonsense about mercenaries, kidnapping etc.  It felt like the author was trying to fill up the pages with whatever filler she could come up with.

Do not bother with this.\n\n', '\n\n  This author is doing great things in the bully/RH genre with her dark and twisty worlds she creates.

A wicked thunderstorm sent my car mud sliding into a ditch and for a girl whose survival skills involve finding the nearest Starbucks, I was in deep trouble.Forced to abandon my car in search of help, I stumbled upon a cabin in the middle of nowhere. Soaking wet, irritated, and in desperate need of a hot shower, I knocked on the door for help only to be greeted by five boisterous, burly, and insanely attractive men.Not just men.Professional hockey players.I hit the motherload of fantasies, right? Wrong.Because as it turns out, one of them is my ex-boyfriend's half-brother. And when I end up crashing in their spare bedroom for the night, things take a very unexpected turn.I'm not sure any amount of survival skills can protect my heart from Vancouver Agitators star goalie, Pacey Lawes.

There was one scene that really bothered my ethics, but I’m going to give it a relative pass because the author did make a point of saying something along the lines of, “I know that this would seem absolutely insane under most circumstances, but…” She then went on to explain. I still found the action wrong, but I can sort of see how she justified it.  Almost.Aside from that one scene and reasonably small storyline, I found this book charming.

I fall for them every time, and Pacey and Winnie are no different. They are both so kind, and caring, both goofy and quirky. It's easy to laugh and smile right along through this book.\n\n"", '\n\n  Pacey & Winnie were everything I needed. The story grabbed me from Chapter 1 and wouldn\'t let me go.Meghan Quinn always has a way with banter and joking, but take 5 massive professional hockey players, jam them into a ""cabin"" in the woods outside Banff and watch the ribbing ensue. These guys are teammates and friends. They know each other\'s buttons to push and it\'s hilarious to watch (or listen) to it happen. Throw a stranded damsel into the mix and it\'s perfection.Pacey and Winnie each find the other familiar in some way from their first meeting even though they don\'t know each other at all. Winnie isn\'t a hockey fan (her BFF Max confirms the OMG factor of her new friends) so even though the house is full of famous athletes, she doesn\'t know them from a murderer in the woods. Again, we get lots of amusement, laughter and some alarmingly paranoid personal safety lectures (that\'s the other BFF Katherine chiming in).Pacey (with help from the other guys) convinces Winnie to stay at the house while she\'s in town and the swoon worthy super fast romance that comes out of it is just incredible. But when they have to go back to the real world, will all the other pressures and anxieties invade their bubble? When a few secrets that were held back come to light will it change things?The answer is always yes, but with all the talent that is Meghan Quinn, she rips out your heart right along with the characters and squishes it, but always reassembles it better than ever for the HEA. The road to get there isn\'t easy (is it ever?), but it\'s so worth it.The Audiobook for this story was performed impeccably by Jason Clarke and Vanessa Edwin. The emotional highs and lows for Pacey along with all the guys, so good. It\'s hard to listen to a conversation between 6-7 males and be able to keep them all separate but Jason does a great job giving each guy their signature. Vanessa presents the awesomeness that is a BFF facetime convo with perfect comedic timing and vocal range (Katherine & Max make me giggle so much). Vanessa also brings Winnie\'s emotional range to life, highs, lows and all the laughter in between, she just makes me feel it all.\n\n', '\n\n  I loved this book! It had a lot of humor, some heat but mostly heart. Winnie and Pacey are great together, and their meet cute was the best part.Winnie goes on an adventure in Banff when her car gets stuck and she stumbles upon a house with five professional hockey players. Pacey makes sure to protect Winnie and boosts her confidence after her previous relationship ended badly. He was very sweet and a great book boyfriend. I am looking forward to the rest of the boys getting their books!\n\n', ""\n\n  Another sweet and funny rom-com from Meghan Quinn! Winnie and Pacey are absolutely adorable.

Island is a welcome and in many ways unique addition to the select company of books—from Plato to now—that have presented, in imaginary terms, a coherent view of what society is not but might be.”  — New York Times Book ReviewThe final novel from Aldous Huxley, Island is a provocative counterpoint to his worldwide classic Brave New World, in which a flourishing, ideal society located on a remote Pacific island attracts the envy of the outside world.In the novel Huxley considered his most important, he transports us to the remote Pacific island of Pala, where an ideal society has flourished for 120 years. Inevitably, this island of bliss attracts the envy and enmity of the surrounding world. A conspiracy is underway to take over Pala, and events are set in motion when an agent of the conspirators, a newspaperman named Faranby, is shipwrecked there. What Faranby doesn't expect is how his time with the people of Pala will revolutionize all his values and—to his amazement—give him hope.

I decided to re-read it just recently and was blown away with how his ideas would still be useful to our world in the areas of how to run a society economically and politically - and how to educated people so they can reach their full potential. I honestly thought that our North American societies would have progressed more in the past sixty years, especially with the benefit of brilliant authors like Huxley showing the way - but it seems that the disease of addiction to money and power which he portrays in the book has continued to guide the direction of our world...

""Island"" was written much later in Huxley\'s life and reflects his interest in Eastern philosophies and his concern about the corruption and exploitation that the Third World suffered from both the West and the Communist Bloc.Huxley hit the nail on the head when he spoke through one of Pala\'s citizens:""Armaments, universal debt, and planned obsolescence - those are the three pillars of Western prosperity. If war, waste, and moneylenders were abolished, you\'d collapse.""This quote from ""Island"" is just as damning an indictment of consumerism now as it was when Huxley\'s novel was published in 1962, if not more so. Huxley was trying to tell us that there is more to life than buying things and being envious of those who have more toys than we do; he was exploring what it really means to be Human. It\'s a very well-written book that is very easy to lose oneself in, so ""Attention!""

The battle of wills, desires, and needs leads to some comical moments, while at the same time highlights just how well these two fit together.  Cara’s abilities really make her shine as a character, as does her compassion and genuine warmth.  Her difficult past directly affects her, yet doesn’t define her.  Talen’s multifaceted character was fantastic.  I enjoyed getting to know him bit by bit via tidbits dropped by those closest to him.  He was also hot, caring, and all Alpha, the type of hero you just can’t look away from.  And let’s not forget Janie, in all her cuteness & insight.  Through her we get to know a lot about the hearts of the main characters, as well as many of the supporting cast.My final thoughts on this one?  How have I never read this novel before now & could someone please hand me the next in the series.

After all this isn't the edge of the solar system or even the galaxy but the universe so it should be huge.

Maas and Laura Thalassa.A Maiden…Chosen from birth to usher in a new era, Poppy’s life has never been her own. The life of the Maiden is solitary. Never to be touched. Never to be looked upon. Never to be spoken to. Never to experience pleasure.

But the choice has never been hers.A Duty…The entire kingdom’s future rests on Poppy’s shoulders, something she’s not even quite sure she wants for herself. Because a Maiden has a heart. And a soul. And longing. And when Hawke, a golden-eyed guard honor bound to ensure her Ascension, enters her life, destiny and duty become tangled with desire and need. He incites her anger, makes her question everything she believes in, and tempts her with the forbidden.A Kingdom…Forsaken by the gods and feared by mortals, a fallen kingdom is rising once more, determined to take back what they believe is theirs through violence and vengeance. And as the shadow of those cursed draws closer, the line between what is forbidden and what is right becomes blurred. Poppy is not only on the verge of losing her heart and being found unworthy by the gods, but also her life when every blood-soaked thread that holds her world together begins to unravel.Reviews for From Blood and Ash:""Dreamy, twisty, steamy escapism.

Throughout the book, you see how she’s fighting to find herself, but still trying to remain true to what people are expecting from her, but as the book progress so many events will be putting her faith to the test. She has a strong personality and she has such endurance to everything she had to go through. I loved how she was portrayed in this book and I’m looking forward to see how much growth she will do in the next books to come.Next is Hawke who is an intriguing character from the moment you are first introduced to him. He is cocky and sure of himself, but he also has a way that makes him seem like he connects with the people he talks to. There is an aura of mystery around him which only wants you to get to know him more. His character pulls you in and you just take anything that he’s giving you.Poppy and Hawke’s chemistry is over the chart and when they are together, you just feel it in everything they do or say. Throughout the book, the two will banter and he really likes to tease her and this just adds more to the chemistry between them. Hawke will be a major factor in Poppy’s search to find herself. He will bring a lot of feelings she hadn’t really had the chance to feel before and it will bring so much more question about what she is expected to do and what she actually wants.So many characters in this book that you will either love, hate or perhaps be confuse about them, but one thing is for sure; none of them will leave you indifferent. Whether you care for them or simply want them gone, they will all make you feel something.The story itself is filled with a lot of this world’s history, its secrets and as truths start to be revealed, the characters will have to debate about where they actually stand in this battle between two clans and whether or not they had been right or wrong about what they knew.I swear this review is hard to write because I could say so much, but spoilers will be said and I want you guys to see for yourself just how awesome this book was. I wanted to re-read this book over and over again once I was done with it. Jennifer L. Armentrout knows what her readers love and she has put up an interesting list of characters, of events and secrets that will captivate you throughout the whole book.Honestly, you need to grab that book right now because it is one amazing read and I can't contain my excitement for the next book to come.\n\n"", '\n\n  This books was exactly what I needed right now and everything I didn’t know I wanted.It was filled with intrigue, mystery, deception and lies.  There are maidens and “prophecies”.  There are shape shifters and the undead.  The female lead is sassy and badass.  The male lead is handsome, dark, and oh so mysterious.  And let’s not forget the unforgettable ANGST!!.Poppy and Hawks story took me by storm and I could not put them down.  Even days after finishing, I am still thinking about them.Honestly, this story had everything I love and the writing was absolutely impeccable.I cannot wait to get my hands on book two, A Kingdom of Flesh and Fire!!READ. THIS. BOOK.This is my first book by this author and I can guarantee you that I will be stalking her back catalogue ASAP!!\n\n', ""\n\n  4.5 Stars“With my sword and with my life, I vow to keep you safe, Penellaphe,” he spoke, voice deep and smooth, reminding me of rich, decadent chocolate. “From this moment until the last moment, I am yours.”From Blood and Ash is the first book I’ve ever read by Jennifer L Armentrout and is definitely not the last as I vow to read the rest of her books because I’m definitely missing out!The story follows Poppy, a Maiden living a guarded life not because she wanted to but because that’s how she was raised. Given a huge responsibility that is connected with the next generation, Poppy never had a choice until the arrival of the new guard, Hawke.The world building was so detailed in this first book of the Blood and Ash series that made me pause and backtrack to analyze what was being described. There was a lot of information in the first half of the book that could be missed easily. I felt that the author’s intention was to build a complex world and to confuse the readers with regards to the plot.Written in Poppy’s point of view, there were instances that I felt frustrated because it wasn't easy to relate to her guarded and innocent mind. Reading from her perspective needs some getting used to but I understand why the author chose to have it that way, I believe it was necessary for the reader’s journey to properly understand where Poppy is coming from and for the sake of the secrets that will be unraveled.The choice of words used were perfect and I must say that JLA can write romance so so so well that it was easy to get lost in the world of From Blood and Ash.Although I had difficulty reading this at first because of some disturbing scenes (sexual harassment), I ended up loving From Blood and Ash and would highly recommend this to any fans of paranormal romance. There’s a lot of intense and sexy scenes that is highly addictive.\n\n"", ""\n\n  I. love. this. book.It was my first Jennifer L. Armentrout book, so I wasn't aware of any of her previous storylines (now that I read a couple of her other books, I do see a lot of overlap).When I first started the book, I didn't think that I would like it. The writing wasn't quite there, and with the Sarah J. Maas comparison I had high expectations. But then, at about 20% in it really started to pick up - definitely give it a chance! The main character really is a heroine and kicks ass.\n\n""]"

Ellen Kirschman's been-there done-that experience makes this a real standout."" —Hank Phillippi Ryan, Agatha, Anthony, and Mary Higgins Clark award winner A floundering, sensitive young rookie cop steps into her office. She tries to help him, but after a few sessions he commits suicide.Not a good look for a psychologist with a new job.Needless to say, Dr. Dot Meyerhoff, newly minted police psychologist, is not only sad, she’s mortified. She’s already discovered counseling cops isn’t easy — that they’re uncommunicative men contemptuous of therapy.But she didn’t expect to fail quite this badly.Freshly divorced and in need of cash, she took the job even though she wasn’t quite prepared for it — especially for the irascible police chief, and the lack of respect throughout the department. Now she’s in danger of losing both the job and her license.Because when a client commits suicide, people tend to blame the therapist. Including Dot herself. She’s beating herself up because she didn’t prevent it. But could she have?She’s desperate to find out, and her quest takes her all over the small California town in which she finds herself. Luckily for the reader, sordid secrets spill out of closets in every neighborhood she visits.For readers, Dot’s unconventional investigation strikes a balance between the intrigue of a page turner and the empathy of a satisfying talk with a beloved friend.Best selling author Shane Gericke said, ""…. a heroine you'd want as a friend, and a tale so gripping it will keep you up at night.… cop fiction with soul.""Fans of Jonathan Kellerman will empathize with Dot’s plight, as well as devotees of Stephen White, Val McDermid, and Abigail Padgett— in fact, anyone who enjoys looking inside the minds of psychologists, as well as those who are looking for a good old-fashioned traditional mystery will love this low-key, thoughtful series.""A deftly crafted novel of compelling complexity…an absorbing read.

I'm in the position of opposing the popularity of Ishiguro's novel Klara. I had SO looked forward to reading it! But it falls short of my expectations. I'm caught up in the beginning and immediately LIKE the narrator who is a robot, but as the novel progresses, I am more and more bored by the extensive dialogue. I skimmed the last 1/4 of the novel. I am a devoted re-reader of complex novels, but not this too-simple one! I'd NEVER read it again.\n\n"", '\n\n  I disliked the glacial first third but found little changed As it wore on. The author claimed in interviews that he had spoken to AI gurus but he seems to have gleaned one idea (robots seeing through geometric shapes) and he must have used this about twenty times. The device of the main character not being able to grasp pronouns is also frustrating. But there is nothing or no one to follow in any depth. The main human becomes inexplicably ill and then recovers.Very few novelists have been able to make futuristic writing interesting in a sustained way. Doris Lessing was bad and Ray Bradbury really innovative and fascinating.But this book will waste your time if you are interested in A.I.; more so if you like character development.\n\n', '\n\n  The writing style is so dull, formulaic and unrefined that makes for a very annoying reading.  The treatment of this important theme seem so childish and simplistic, nothing like the brilliant Machines Like Us by Ian McEwan. It is the second novel by Kazuo Ishiguro that disappoints me greatly. Too bad.\n\n', '\n\n  I never thought that I would become emotionally attached to a robot; but the author does a good job at humanizing Klara in an innocent and touching way - thus I want her to succeed.  I really enjoyed this book.I am currently enjoying another book by Kazuo Ishiguro called Never Let Me Go.  I also downloaded The Remains of the Day.  I think I have found a new author to follow.\n\n', ""\n\n  I liked how the novel gives the reader a fresh new look at artificial intelligence from a different perspective. I found it to be very thought provoking. I felt emotionally attached to the central character, though only a machine. Of course, there's a lot more to it than that, and the book really speaks to human behaviour.You'll enjoy this book if you are interested in thinking about some of the possibilities that could come from humans and androids intermingling.I gave it a 5 because I felt it was very well written and kept my interest throughout. Gobbled it up.\n\n"", '\n\n  A touching story told by an android. We see through her eyes some of the common humans stories: Love, divorce, greed, anger, strong beliefs in unlikely superstition and finally death or, at least, the road to death. Ishiguro paints vivid and real pictures the possible journeys that we all might take and the relationships along the way. His writing is beautiful and simple; touching and colourful.\n\n', '\n\n  Klara has the same sadness as Remains of the Day and Never Let Me Go. Gracefully decline without complaint for the wonderfully developed main character. Excellent.\n\n', '\n\n  Product arrived safe and sound and was as good as expected.  Betraying all this is the fact that it took no less than three weeks after order date until it appeared on my door step.

  Deep in the Amazon lies the solution to the global energy crisis - a mysterious source of power that will end our dependency on oil. It's not the only discovery. When entomologist Rebecca Riley receives a series of strange photographs from expedition leader and former partner, Ed Reardon, she finds herself heading to Brazil to join the team of scientists assembling there. She hasn't seen Ed for more than a year, and their relationship hadn't ended well. But his revelation is impossible to ignore. What she uncovers is beyond imagination: strange statues in the jungle... a ruined city built by the refugees of a lost Pacific continent... and a terrifying new species. She knows this is no ordinary animal. When the team is attacked, the mission becomes a desperate race for survival, and Rebecca must confront a crippling childhood phobia she'd thought long dead and buried. An ancient enemy has awakened, one whose very existence has implications for all of humankind... and the planet itself. TERROR HAS A NEW SPECIES. Reviewers are loving the action and scares of EIGHT: ""A wild roller coaster-ride-from-hell that keeps you guessing to the very end.""Knockin' Books ""Wow!

I drifted through the meeting wondering what could happen to the young girl in the book on her journey and just where the storyline could or would be going! I then decided I needed to have a rare afternoon off just to get to the end of the book, just to see if the writer could keep this going at the pace that the book started with, but, every time I thought I could slow down for a break, something else happened in the wild twists and turns to pin me right back in my seat. I must admit in all humility, that I now have a new phobia and the storyline scared the (Beep) out of me more than once!. The writing was brilliant and easy to follow, didn't overpower me with too much detail, just enough to understand the situation and flowed so smoothly from one situation to another with surprises around every bush, that I didn't even realize I had finished.

But good authors of action novels know how to limit and ration the horror, the exploits, and the violence to levels that are credible.  This author does not have that skill.  Ancient civilizations, giant spiders (megarachnids!), terrorist commandos, seal teams, alien technologies, bullets flying helos crashing people dying: it’s got it all but it’s not credible, it’s risible.  I am reminded of a line from ‘Calvin and Hobbes’ “Just then a horde of Nazi frogmen broke in”.  If it were a paperback, I would have thrown it across the room: not a good idea with an e-reader.  All that action gets boring and, frankly, it gets silly.  I no longer cared about the characters, I rooted for the spiders and the aliens.  ‘Penny dreadful’ is too kind a description of this book; Marvel Comics are WAY more credible and engaging.\n\n', ""\n\n  The  authors work hard to bring new situations for us, so I won't give any spoilers!I will say, it's an interesting & entertaining adventure, with more twists & turns than, than, than I don't know what!I'm no author!But as you do immerse yourself in this novel, be reminded that you are going to squirm around & check yourself for anything creepy crawly...MOLON LABE!\n\n"", '\n\n  This book kept me totally spellbound from beginning to end!

  INTERNATIONAL BESTSELLER In Silverview, John le Carré turns his focus to the world that occupied his writing for the past sixty years—the secret world itself.Julian Lawndsley has renounced his high-flying job in the City for a simpler life running a bookshop in a small English seaside town. But only a couple of months into his new career, Julian’s evening is disrupted by a visitor. Edward, a Polish émigré living in Silverview, the big house on the edge of town, seems to know a lot about Julian’s family and is rather too interested in the inner workings of his modest new enterprise. When a letter turns up at the door of a spy chief in London warning him of a dangerous leak, the investigations lead him to this quiet town by the sea . . . Silverview is the mesmerizing story of an encounter between innocence and experience and between public duty and private morals. In this last complete masterwork from the greatest chronicler of our age, John le Carré asks what you owe to your country when you no longer recognize it.

Overcome any suspicion you might possess towards posthumous publications. This novel was fully written before le Carré’s passing at the end of 2020. His younger son wonders why it had not been published, before offering an explanation of his own as an afterword to the book, which I’ll not share here, as you can have an equally speculative hypothesis of your own. For me, a fan of le Carré, this was one last gift from the revered writer of the spy genre. It is a short novel, which once it gathers pace becomes hard to put down. Sentimentality and nostalgia are not required, as this is a story that stands on its own feet, with as worthy characters and plot as the author always delivered.  So, set aside the time, pick your favourite reading spot and beverage, and enjoy.\n\n', '\n\n  I\'m being generous in giving ""Silverview"" a 3-star rating, but I\'m giving it only out of deep respect and admiration for le Carre. As a lifelong reader and re-reader of le Carre, this last novel reminded me more of Agatha Christie than one of the greatest novelists of the 20th century. I have immediately started a reading project to revisit all my other le Carre favourites, knowing I will not be disappointed, just transported and  enchanted.\n\n', ""\n\n  Full disclosure - I own at least one copy of everything ever written by John LeCarre (David Cornwell). I knew it couldn't go on forever and was saddened to hear of his passing. The posthumous release of this novel was very welcome even though I approached it with some trepidation - my experience of novels purporting to be by other well-loved authors after their deaths has been less than stellar. This one clearly was written, in the main, by the genuine author. I found it consistent with his style and comforting as an old blanket to snuggle into. If it is the last we will see of him, it is a fine bookend to a great career that I am grateful to have shared.\n\n"", '\n\n  This is a brilliant close to a series of novels that began with ""Call from the Dead"" in 1961.  Interestingly, while Smiley is long gone, as are many other familiar characters, certain of Le Carre\'s characteristics remain.  For instance, where ""Call..."" swivelled about postal cards, ""Silverview"" depends upon several (sealed) letters.  Highly recommended to readers of earlier Le Carre\'s or novels in general.  Ave atque vale!\n\n', '\n\n  This is not a typical Care book. In fact, when it was finished, I wondered if it had not fully loaded to my Kindle device, it was so short and lacking the length, mystery and suspense I was expecting. While the content may be of significance to families of individuals in intelligence services,  and have an interesting take on that life,  it was not what I had expected based on the past work of the author and the price. There may have been a reason why the  author did not publish this book himself.\n\n', '\n\n  You need to be a real John Le Carre fan to enjoy this novel. It has that jump all over writing with characters the reader tries to fit into the puzzle. One sees how end of career spies are treated. I bought it because it was his last novel, but am not a true fan.\n\n', '\n\n  The sadness of Le Carre’s death for the reader comes home keenly as you finish this book. I am jealous of those of you who have not read all his books. The joy of reading this book is certainly solace.\n\n', ""\n\n  Disappointing, but before you read the novel, read LeCarre's son's section at the end. In this tale the circus is in some disarray and all is not well therein.\n\n""]"
