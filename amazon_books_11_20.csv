  In July 1981, just days after his release from jail, Clifford Olson Junior unleashed hell on British Columbia. He kidnapped, raped and killed six children and teenagers in a single month. While the previous missing children had been treated like runaways, there was now no question that somebody was abducting children in the Lower Mainland area, and the media went berserk.The police immediately came under scrutiny for failing to connect the previous disappearances. The missing person cases were passed to homicide detectives, and a whole new investigation began. The police were now hunting a serial killer and Clifford Olson Junior was one of the main suspects.From the age of seventeen, Clifford Olson Junior spent only 1,501 days outside of prison or jail. If his claims are to be believed, he averaged about one murder every ten days. During his imprisonment, he was assessed on the Hare Psychopathy Checklist, a tool designed to evaluate psychopathy. The standard threshold is 25-30. He scored a 38 out of 40, the highest rating ever recorded.The Beast is a chilling account of Clifford Olson Junior and one of the most disturbing true crime stories in Canada’s history. Ryan Green’s riveting narrative draws the reader into the real-live horror experienced by the victims and has all the elements of a classic thriller.CAUTION: This book contains descriptive accounts of torture, abuse and violence. If you are especially sensitive to this material, it might be advisable not to read any further.

I absolutely loved this book!This story had all of the elements that I love to read in a romance novel. There was trope upon trope upon trope! There was royalty, a bodyguard, a forbidden romance, and somewhat of an enemies-to-lovers (but closer to friends-to-lovers) all combined into a slow burn work of art. I loved this book so much that although the novel length is greater than 400 pages, I finished reading it in less than a day because I couldn\'t put it down.This story had everything: it was angsty, mysterious, and there was an adventure. This author\'s writing flows so easily that it\'s more than easy to get caught up in the story only to find out later you are hundreds of pages in.Not only can I not wait to continue this series (and circle back to book one as I haven\'t read it yet) but I can\'t wait for more novels from this author in general. I can tell, in the same vein as Mariana Zapata, this author is going to be an indie author that I now consider an ""auto-buy"".\n\n', '\n\n  If you grew up loving Princess Diaries, then you\'ll love this.This was like a very adult take on Princess Diaries 3.In Twisted Love, we have the Princess and the Bodyguard who fall for each other. Which is obviously not allowed and causes some friction.This book was a slowburn with absolute FIRE tension. Bridget and Rhys were the epitome of grumpy - sunshine! I loved seeing Bridget pull Rhys out of himself and Rhys was always the person who knew Bridget best.It may have been a slow burn but GOSH did it get spicy as hell when that tension finally broke. "" you\'re my princess in public, but my whore in private""If that quote alone doesn\'t illustrate how spicy things get.. I dont know what would?!?!?!The only reasons that I didn\'t mark this a 5 is because some of the book gave me anxiety. LOL I got all twitchy when Bridget and Rhys were hiding things and I kept waiting for them to get caught and was trying to figure out who was going to catch them.\n\n', '\n\n  A new author for me and I am thrilled to find a great author.  I loved this book and I hadn’t read book 1 but I will definitely go get it now and a paid copy of this book for my library.  This is the second book of the Twisted series and revolves around Bridget and Rhys’s forbidden love.  This is the kind of story that ends to soon.  It was captivating and compelling.  Both characters were extremely likeable and you couldn’t help but root for them.  Rhys had a tendency to be broody but his very strong and protective nature makes up for it.  and strong. I really liked everything about this book.  The romance was captivating, the characters well suited.  I loved the cover and presentation and can’t wait for more from this author while I catch up on her current library.  I voluntarily received an arc copy of this book from HiddenGems\n\n', '\n\n  I’m not usually into books that involve royals, but I loved Bridget’s character in Twisted Love and the angst she shared with her new bodyguard. I knew I needed to give this one a chance and I was NOT disappointed!Firstly, I love Bridget. She has a spine of steel and enough sass to make anyone question going against her, but you can try ;). I love everything about her and how she carries herself.Secondly, Rhys love and devotion to her, even when he seemingly couldn’t stand her, is everything! The way he fights to be with her, even if he can’t ‘be with her’ is truly incredible and I was here for it!If you love steam, taboo and a healthy dose of a b@dass FMC, then you definitely need to read this book!\n\n', ""\n\n  The second book in this series is about Bridget, princess of Eldorra who is friends with Ava from the first book and her new Bodyguard Rhys Larsen. It is very much an enemies to lovers romance, and a bit too slowburn.  But once the hate changes, it's a very good read.  I understand the 2 year span helps establish the depth of their feelings.  It's a great read with steam, twists and betrayals.\n\n"", '\n\n  Twisted games? Really it could be called Twisted Heart because it was an emotional roller coaster. Rhys is the grumpy, strict, dominant bodyguard. Bridget is the princess, who uses sarcasm to protect herself. They both have experienced extreme loss and life isn’t always as you think. The characters were so well written and the plot kept me turning the pages, rooting for their HEA. Can’t wait for the next one!\n\n', '\n\n  I loved this just as much as the previous bookBridget and Rhys where everything, their rocky beginning after Bridget was so use to Booth after so long, the way he always called her ""princess"". My heart flipped everytime.I loved the agnast, the emotional turmoil of their unrequited love and the resilience of Rhys to stay away from you when  he was her bodyguard. He\'s protectiveness also reminded me for the last week but more violent then the bookThe dirty talk was so good and can\'t wait for the next book with Jules and Josh!. Please read this if you haven\'t.\n\n', ""\n\n  I loved the first book, but this love story captured me.

Thank you to Joffe Books, NetGalley and the author for the e-ARC in exchange for an honest review.\n\n', ""\n\n  Rick Mofina is a new to me author. His latest book is Search for Her.Mofina starts off with a frightening premise. Fourteen year old Riley decides to wait in the RV while the rest of her newly blended family heads into the truck stop. When they get back on the road, they assume she is taking a nap in the bedroom. It's not until they're miles down the road that anyone genuinely checks. And yup, you guessed it - she's missing....The search for Riley is anything but easy. The police don't seem to believe Grace and husband John that it was an accident. Instead they're focusing on the family as suspects. The police work in Search for Her is busy, with many agencies involved as the case crosses state lines. Although all the right words are there, I had a hard time believing some of the investigation. Information or leads are discovered at fortuitous points in the story. Technology breaks down and isn't discovered for days. Mofina gives us lots of suspects right from the get go including the family. It seems every one of them is hiding something. The listener is given hints as to each family member's hidden secrets, but it takes a while before they are revealed. This does serve to keep the listener engaged. There are also lots of peripheral characters that may or may not have a bearing on the case. One caught my eye as the way they were portrayed was just too 'good' IMO.Understandably, the family is panicked. Especially Grace. And I felt for her - I really did. But I got so tired of her caterwauling 'Where's Riley?' I know, I know, her child is missing. Character development takes a back seat in Search for Her. Instead, it action that propels the book forward. There are twists along the way, but some of them seemed awkward to me, including the reasoning and mind set of the initial suspect.I chose to listen to Search for Her. The reader was Jennifer Jill Araya. This was a first listen of this narrator for me. She has a nice clear speaking voice, enunciates well, paces her speaking speed, and is, for the most part, really easy to listen to. She provides tones and voices for many, including males that are believable. She is indeed a very expressive reader and captures the tone of Mofina's book with her interpretation.Mofina hits all the right notes for what I would call 'light suspense.' But, I prefer my suspense a little darker and my police procedures a little more believable. Overall, an easy read for the beach bag this summer.\n\n"", ""\n\n  Rick Mofina is one of my go to authors when I want a captivating read and Search For Her is his latest mystery/thriller.A family's cross country move turns into a journey from hell when the 14 yr old daughter goes missing at a busy truck stop.

Somewhere when I started this series with “The Girls Across The Bay” I read that it was book 1 of a trilogy but ala Douglas Adams “The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy” that reached at least 5 books I have now read book 4 of this trilogy and it has a big hint that book 5 is on the way and am I ever glad. As anyone who reads my reviews has surely noticed I am very stingy with 5 star ratings but this book grabbed me very early and just got better and better the farther I read and I kept telling myself if the author didn’t blow the ending this was going to be a 5 star rating. And what a solid ending it turned out to be! I could hardly imagine how Ms O’Brien was going to tie all of Madigan and Grace’s seemingly unrelated investigations together but somehow after so many twists and turns and false suspects everything came together in an absolutely logical conclusion and enough clues were delivered throughout the story that one should have been able to identify the perp but I admit I had one of the many suspects picked as the culprit and I was dead wrong. Through the earlier books in this series my opinion of Madigan and Grace has waffled back and forth from not liking them much to liking them quite a lot but always feeling a lot of empathy for them and in this book it started out a bit like that but I sure grew to really liking them at the end and I’m looking forward to another great investigation with them. BTW Mac has become a top notch character and possibly the best one in the book. Another big surprise was the ending of the Raven/Melanie subplot which again I never saw coming. A great book and possibly one of my best reads of the year and I want more good books from Ms O’Brien.\n\n""]"

You'd think after having read 11 books by her in the past, I'd be tired of it.I thought so to. When I met Trinity, she reminded me so much of Alex from the Covenant series. I really didn't think j was going to enjoy it. But I devoured it ... in a day and a half.I'm a sucker for any story that involves nephilim, demons and all that divine jazz. There's a reason I still watch Supernatural. Storm and Fury added the element of gargoyles, and I was hooked!The world building was amazing. The characterization was brilliant. Trinity was more human than Alex, more vulnerable. She has more depth, which makes her one of my new favourite heroines.I have not read the Dark Materials series, but I don't think I want to. I like Roth, but Layla seems annoying.The supporting characters could have been fleshed out more, but Peanut all but made up for it. I loved that little ghostie and his sass.Zayne ended up growing on me quite a bit, and I'm dying to know how things are going to work out for the poor guy dealing with what he can't have...again.The writing and dialogue really draw you in....but it's JLA, she does witty banter like no other.What, I did really enjoy was the moral commentary that was underlying in the story. It isn't anything new, but the concept of demons being good and people fearing what they don't know was showcased really well in certain scenes. I have read countless books with angels, but it's the first time I've read one where I rooted for demons.I got serious Lucifer vibes, and I loved it.I think I like this series better than Lux and Covenant, already. I really, really need it to be June...and then God knows how much longer till the next one!!!! Going to find another book to fill this void, bye.\n\n"", ""\n\n  With the synopsis offered I set my expectations way too high. This book has many grammar mistakes and a very predictable plot. I found a website that stated this book is similar to Sarah J. Maas' books. I completely disagree. I felt this book was for someone much much younger than I. And I'm only in my 20s. Maas has character development that makes you really feel like you know the characters and imagery that makes you feel you are actually living inside the book making it incredibly difficult to put her books down.

This new adventure with new lead character Trinity and returning favourite Zayne is currently my favourite. The story was packed with character development, drama, heart, and action. I really did love it and am so excited for the next instalment.Trinity is one of my new favourite characters. Despite being prickly in the beginning, she quickly charmed me with her sass and kindness. More than anything else, I was happy to see the return of Zayne, who I treasure and loved to see grow. He is kind and gentlemanly, but still intense and complicated. They have excellent chemistry together, and I loved the moments where they worked to heal and help each other through their pasts and pain.There were new abilities, secrets, and twists that added to the world building, allowing it to be seen through new eyes. That said, there were also familiar faces that added to Zayne and Trinity's development. The action scenes and romance were ramped up for this sequel and I am already biting my nails for the next book.I really did love it and still have so many questions. I'm a big fan of Armentrout's work and am stoked to see what happens next!\n\n""]"

I watched the first series based on the first book and really enjoyed it, so I figured I'd read all the books since I had to wait for new series. I have to say I'm glad I watched the series before reading the book because I'm not sure I would have got they've the first one otherwise. I can't put my finger on why, but I found the first book not as engrossing as the second one. Maybe it's because of all of the set up that has to happen for the characters.The second in this trilogy, as I said above, definitely takes you on a ride. Matthew and Diana become much more themselves as they go around trying to get Diana help in strengthening her powers.The final book wraps up all the threads that were pulled at during the first two books and it was equally as enjoyable as the second. Something I came to realize though in this book was there are SO many secondary characters that it was difficult to give many of them real justice in the story. For instance, I very much wanted to know and see more of what Ysabeau could do.Overall the books are enjoyable and helped me escape mentally for a while, but some of the secondary characters and their plots might have been trimmed to give the stronger supporting characters a chance to really shine.\n\n"", '\n\n  Downloaded the e-book, All Souls Trilogy, written by Deborah Harkness, and it was 60 wonderful hours of reading.

It is not only a fantasy, but is also historically accurate, taking the reader on a wonderful ride from 2021 back to the 16th Century and back again to 2021. The story is a tale of a Witch who falls in love with a vampire, when that type of love is forbidden, woven into a story of them in search of a valuable manuscript.  There are also Daemons involved, in a world fraught with wonder, terror, fear and excitement.  It is a great story, an incredible read, and well worth the time it takes to get through the 3 books.

  The 25TH ANNIVERSARY EDITION of the original ground-breaking book on high sensitivity with over 500,000 copies sold. ARE YOU A HIGHLY SENSITIVE PERSON?  Do you have a keen imagination and vivid dreams? Is time alone each day as essential to you as food and water? Are you noted for your empathy?  Your conscientiousness? Do noise and confusion quickly overwhelm you? If your answers are yes, you may be a highly sensitive person (HSP) and Dr. Elaine Aron’s The Highly Sensitive Person is the life-changing guide you’ll want in your toolbox.  Over twenty percent of people have this amazing, innate trait.  Maybe you are one of them.  A similar percentage is found in over 100 species, because high sensitivity is a survival strategy.  It is also a way of life for HSPs.   In this 25th anniversary edition of the groundbreaking classic, Dr. Elaine Aron, a research and clinical psychologist as well as an HSP herself, helps you grasp the reality of your wonderful trait, understand your past in the light of it, and make the most of it in your future. Drawing on her many years of study and face-to-face time spent with thousands of HSPs, she explains the changes you will need to make in order to lead a fuller, richer life. Along with a new Author’s Note, the latest scientific research, and a fresh discussion of anti-depressants, this edition of The Highly Sensitive Person is more essential than ever for creating the sense of self-worth and empowerment every HSP deserves and our planet needs.“Elaine Aron has not only validated and scientifically corroborated high sensitivity as a trait—she has given a level of empowerment and understanding to a large group of the planet’s population. I thank Dr. Aron every day for her having brought this awareness to the world.”  —Alanis Morissette, artist, activist, teacher  Read more  ","['5.0 out of 5 stars', '3.0 out of 5 stars', '1.0 out of 5 stars', '5.0 out of 5 stars', '5.0 out of 5 stars', '5.0 out of 5 stars', '5.0 out of 5 stars', '5.0 out of 5 stars']","['\nExcellent  advice for men, despite the female centric writing.\n', '\nRethinking Sensitivity\n', '\nSave your money\n', ""\nKind of crazy feeling like you're reading a book someone studied you to write\n"", '\nA must-read if you think you (or someone you know) are highly sensitive.\n', '\nLife changing...\n', '\nLife-changing\n', '\nLife changing read\n']","['\n\n  Only half way through and it’s made life easier.

This book has many fluffy foo foo Linguistic  overtones, but it the Value of the information is top-notch. Just remember to look for the underlying lesson instead of worrying about the gendered language.\n\n', ""\n\n  This book is a interesting read for anyone who has been told they are “too sensitive” or for anyone struggling in personal or professional relationships. The introduction asks a series true or false questions to examine it you may be a HSP. The topic “Special But deeply Misunderstood” is a very interesting part of the book as it helped to explain my personal struggles with overstimulation in the city environment. The concept of creating a balance between ‘bored’ and ‘over aroused’ states is outlined in a general way.The book covers a range of topics in a very general overview. The author is trained from a Jungian perspective and incorporates concepts from an analytic framework to encourage readers to develop strategies to understand their unconscious processes and change definitions of self. The book is based on case studies from the author and the descriptions are rich with theory from the analytic tradition. At times, I found the text is dry and difficult to get through. However, I found a variety of insights applicable to my current and past situation. The most encouraging and thought provoking element of this book is the concept that being sensitive is a positive attribute desirable for personal and professional relationships. The concept that being introverted is not negative is currently expressed frequently online, such as several TED talks on the subject. In reading Dr. Elaine N. Aron’s work it is important to keep in mind that these idea were less common at the time this book was written.On the topic of medication, the author encourages readers to ask questions and consider if they are medicating their trait. The divide between psychotherapy based approaches and medical treatments is common, particularly as it can be difficult to conceptualize how to incorporate case-study research into evidence based practice. I think future research should embody the strengths of both medicine and psychotherapy methods to enhance individuality and healthcare outcomes.The last chapter, on soul and spirit I found to be particularly insightful. Dr. Aron clearly explains the Jungian concept of the shadow side in simple layman's terms. She explains that HSPs often have strong and variable spiritual inclinations in a quest towards ‘wholeness’. The author provides several activities throughout the book that can be useful. For example, she suggests writing a ‘spiritual journal’ for 30 days by simply noting: insights, moods, dreams, prayers and strange coincidences.My rating for this book is three stars overall, however I would rate several of the chapters (such as the last chapter) with 5 stars.\n\n"", '\n\n  I have not yet finished this book, but so far consider this purchase to be a waste of money. It is poorly written, the information is generally anecdotal, and although it is apparently thoroughly based on ""research,"" it is more like reading a compilation of personal opinion and story, that is highly debatable and subjective. Overall, I find the subject matter or topic itself can be very helpful for anyone trying to understand themselves as a sensory sensitive person (learning about this in general has been helpful for me, personally), however I think this book attempts it poorly. You may be better off to just do your own research, see what other information is available on the internet, research occupational therapy resources on this topic, or read the author\'s web page (which has more helpful information, I found).\n\n', ""\n\n  Kind of crazy feeling like you're reading a book someone studied you to write. Very agreeable and insightful. Not only is it like reading about all of these little things you never felt you could pinpoint or articulate, or share with someone, but it's also got a lot of insight into how to channel the positive aspects of sensitivity and input into how not to view this as a weakness or a shortfall in yourself. Love love love it. It's also great to gift to people you think could learn more about you, as it explains things that are hard to share with others if you are highly sensitive. It's a good read for those who are and those who aren't but are close to hsp's.\n\n"", '\n\n  I bought this book after hearing about it on YouTube and thinking I probably had the trait of high sensitivity myself. Reading it made me learn a lot more about myself as well as understand my behaviour and reactions in different situations better. Dr. Aron\'s explanations are easy to understand and the book contains many real stories of highly sensitive people. The chapters on work (#6) and close relationships (#7), especially, were revelations to me. I liked ""The Highly Sensitive Person"" so much that I bought and started reading ""The Highly Sensitive Person in Love"".\n\n', ""\n\n  I am so shaken by this book and sad I wasn't aware of it when I was a teenager or even my early 20s. My soul has been without for so long and now I am learning on how to live this book is helping me even more. I am so thankful to everyone who helpes make this book possible.\n\n"", '\n\n  For someone suspecting they’re highly sensitive, this is almost godsend. I personally recognized myself in the vast majority of associated traits, and knowing how this has affected my life was such a relief. Even just understanding the mechanisms is life-changing, and the book offers much more than that.\n\n', '\n\n  This book has changed my life. It’s very informative but not too technical. The author gives a lot of information from interviews and actual people who identify as HSP. She also comments on the wide range of people who identify as HSP and highlights the different traits for everyone. Love it!\n\n']"

She's not the experienced Irish maid who was hired to work in one of Pittsburgh's grandest households. She's a poor farmer's daughter with nowhere to go and nothing in her pockets. But the woman who shares her name has vanished, and assuming her identity just might get Clara some money to send back home.Clara must rely on resolve as strong as the steel Pittsburgh is becoming famous for and an uncanny understanding of business, attributes that quickly gain her Carnegie's trust. But she still can't let her guard down, not even when Andrew becomes something more than an employer. Revealing her past might ruin her future—and her family's.With captivating insight and heart, Carnegie's Maid is a book of fascinating 19th century historical fiction.

It interweaves Clara Kelly\'s fictional story to that of ""Andrew Carnegie\'s transformation from ruthless industrialist into the world\'s first true philanthropist.""The focus of this story is really Clara\'s life - she was shipped from Galway, Ireland to America, in hope of finding a job in service or in a factory; allowing her to send her earnings back home to help support her family who are still suffering the effects of the Irish potato famine. Instead, she lands a job in the Carnegie household, an error in identity providing her with a way out of poverty.What follows are ""journal type"" entries (not a formal journal, but all in the first person narrative and dated) of her life with the Carnegies. We get a glimpse into what shaped Andrew Carnegie\'s work-ethic, his relationship with his mother and brother Tom, and we also get a sense of his belief that all people are created equal and deserve the chance to a better life. Clara\'s relationship with Andrew is that of not only romantic interest (all very proper), but also an intellectual one. In her, he finds a sounding board to his ideas, and was challenged by her own ideas.Clara was a well developed character. Perhaps it was a little far-fetched to believe that Andrew Carnegie would have sought out the opinion and advice of his mother\'s lady\'s maid, but their relationship was lovely to watch unfold.This is not a book that is full of tension, nor does it have a ""mysterious twist"". This is simply a well written story of what ""might have been""/ ""could have been"". The entire thing was written in a way that transported the reader to Pittsburgh during the American Civil War, and brought to light what was happening in Ireland at the same time.Well written, highly enjoyable. A book in which you can simply escape the reality of the every day.Recommended.\n\n', '\n\n  This book gave a look into the life of Irish immigrants who came to America for a better life.

The cuteness of both MCs not wanting to bring up the relationship, it eventually comes up for the better - both Sam's Grandma and Etienne's skate partner had brought it up prior.

Did I mention that there’s only one double bed in Etienne’s cabin? Suffice it to say, Sam finally realizes he’s in love with his best friend.I really liked the plot in that falling in love with a best friend is one of my favourite tropes. The two MCs are believable and very sympathetic. Sam’s family is great, particularly his grandmother. The book can be read fairly quickly and one is left with a warm, fuzzy feeling at the end.\n\n', '\n\n  This fluffy Christmas novella is the perfect antidote to grey, gloomy winter days.  Sam and Etienne’s best-friends-to-lovers tale is sweet and satisfying, with just the right amount of heat.Set amid the world of figure skating and mostly at an upper-end ski resort in Quebec, Andrews makes the transition in their relationship adorably awkward and fun.  Sam’s bi-awakening was generally non-traumatic in all the best ways.Side characters add to the lightheartedness delightfully, especially Bree and Sam’s grandma.  Despite the characters’ inner turmoil, this is a low-angst, fun, romantic romp.The only downside (for me) is I feel this could have easily been a full-length novel, more fully developing the men’s friendship prior to them getting together.  At times it felt like a whole lot of storyline was being crammed into a small space.\n\n', ""\n\n  Such a sweet and steamy, no angst, best friends to lovers, gfy story. It was short but it didn't feel like instalove cause they have always been besties. I was left with a few questions but the next book is the same group of friends so I'm hoping for future updates so I didn't let that affect my rating. This did mention Cheistmas but it was very brief. The focus is on their figure skating and relationship, for anyone not in the holiday spirit no worries. I loved the MCs. They had amazing chemistry. I loved the group of friends too.

  The remarkable story of a family of Jewish performers whose dwarfism helped them survive Auschwitz: “Mesmerizing . . . no reader will fail to admire the Ovitzes.” —Kirkus ReviewsIn this remarkable, never-before-told account of the Ovitz family, seven of whose ten members were dwarves, readers bear witness to the best and worst of humanity and to the terrible irony of the Ovitzes’ fate: being burdened with dwarfism helped them endure the Holocaust. Israeli authors Yehuda Koren and Eilat Negev weave the tale of a beloved and successful family of performers who were famous entertainers in Central Europe until the Nazis deported them to Auschwitz in May 1944. Descending into the hell of the concentration camp from the transport train, the Ovitz family—known widely as the Lilliput Troupe—was separated from other Jewish victims. Dr. Josef Mengele was notified of their arrival and they were assigned better quarters and provided more nutritious food than other inmates. The authors chronicle Mengele’s experiments upon the Ovitzes, and the creepy fondness he developed for these small people, even the songs he composed and sang to this family of singers, dancers, and klezmorim. Finally liberated by Russian troops, the family returned to their deserted village in Transylvania, and eventually found their way to a new home in Israel. This is the story of their lives—and how they escaped the fate that befell so many others.“Fascinating.” —The Jerusalem Post  Read more  ","['5.0 out of 5 stars', '5.0 out of 5 stars']","['\nAmazing book!\n', '\na poignant and uplifting story of survival\n']","['\n\n  Amazing book !!  held me right from the beginning, if your interested in the Holocaust and stories of survival then you will like this book.\n\n', '\n\n  As an avid reader of many Holocaust stories, I was very moved by the remarkable, true story written by Yehuda Koren and Eilat Negev, Israeli authors who interviewed the last surviving dwarf of the Lilliput Troupe. This Orthodox family which consisted of ten children, seven of whom were dwarfs, all survived the horrors of the Auschwitz Concentration Camp and the experiments by Joseph Mengele. Unlike other stories of Holocaust survivors which describe horrific conditions of death, starvation, and torture, this story is unique in that the reader can identify with the emotions and vicissitudes of the dwarfs and sympathize with their situation. It is a poignant and uplifting story of survival and compassion for the little people of the world who have made an important contribution to world history, unique in the Orthodox world.\n\n']"

That epilogue had me laughing and crying. It was perfectly beautiful.At times it felt young (which I typically don’t like) but I had so much fun reading this, I didn’t care. I really loved it. And I look forward to reading more from these sexy brothers! Though it’s going to be tough to beat my love for Flynn. If your looking for a fun and sexy read, read this!“The truth is, I think I fell in love with Daisy the first moment I saw her. Some part of me offered to save her because, deep down, I knew she’d save me.”\n\n', '\n\n  For those unfamiliar with the name of the author, they state, ‘A secret duo of romance authors team up under the pseudonym Max Monroe to bring you a sexy, laugh-out-loud new series…& more. ;)  Writing partners and long time friends, Max and Monroe strive to live and write all the fun, sexy swoon so often missing from their Facebook newsfeed. Sarcastic by nature, their two writing souls feel like they’ve found their other half.’One of the many aspects of the authors’ writing skills is the degree of humor that they infuse steamy erotica. The language is a bit overdone in the potty mouth category, but it fits the story just fine. Naughty all the way .A tease of their sparkling writing skills follows as we meet Flynn: “The four Winslow brothers in Vegas. What could go wrong? Ha. Pretty much every-[expletive]–thing can go wrong when all three of my brothers decided a boozy brunch to start the day was a grand idea. Although, so far, their drunken sins revolve around stumbling steps and being a little too loud for the early afternoon casino crowd, but my track record of knowing them my entire life predicts this day to be one hell of a chaotic rife. Says the bastard who always chooses to be the responsible sober brother of the group.’’The plot is summarized as follows, from Daisy’s vantage: “I need a ride,” I said to a sexy stranger on a Harley. Three hours later? A six-foot-tall Marilyn Monroe was officiating our Vegas wedding at the Happy Chapel. But it’s not love—it’s business—a marriage pact made out of desperation so my career doesn’t go up in flames. Sure, Flynn Winslow is a hot, broody, mysterious man that women all over the globe would sell their souls to land for real, but I have my eyes on the prize and our marriage arrangement will end in three months with no strings attached. Right? Or will it all go out the window when I have to move in with Mr. Mysterious and our fake marriage starts to feel remarkably real? I wish it were as easy as telling myself,  Do not fall in love with your fake husband, Daisy, but apparently, when feelings get involved, not everything that happens in Vegas knows how to stay in Vegas.’It is a rollercoaster ride sparkling with erotica and guffaws. Enjoy a naughty outing in Vegas! Grady Harp, November 21\n\n', '\n\n  I laughed, I cried, I laughed some more.  I loved this book.  It’s one of my fav reads. This is the second book in the Winslow Brothers series about Flynn.  He is known as the quiet one.  He keeps to himself and doesn’t speak unless it is necessary but he’s a good guy, loyal and intelligent and a gorgeous alpha.  Daisy is pretty much the opposite- a bit of a scattered brain, bubbly, friendly but still as successful and beautiful inside and,out.  I absolutely loved their banter and smiled and laughed often.  This story warmed my heart.  I voluntarily received an a gorgeous complete arc copy from the author with thanks.\n\n']"

I think I was expecting a bit more darkness after reading the blurb, it seemed fairy tame, at least compared to others I have read.

Ladies, I’d like you to meet the 13th Duke of Dalforth, Henry Charles Alexander Theodore Dalforth. He is all of the above and so much more.Holly (Holland Harper), an American, a teacher by trade currently a tutor/social secretary for the tween daughters of an American couple while living and working in London. She has one more night of holidays left before going back to work little does she know she’s about to meet her Duke!Their eyes meet over a lowered newspaper, followed by a hand (part of a beautiful strong wrist); leading to a cup of coffee and a night of drinking, smoldering eyes meeting each other, all because of a mix up with a pair of swingers, pretend names and a night they can’t forget.This dear readers/reviewers of books, this is where I give you just a few more hints, the Duke has a half-brother, a sister and a six year old and eight year old nephew. Not to take away from the Duke and his teacher but these boys, honestly I swooned over them as well.Through the magic of an author they all end up in Scotland at Kilblair Castle, where their story continues to “heat up.”I love reading Donna Alam books! In No Ordinary Gentleman she gives readers witty retorts, the slyest of glances in crowded rooms, a Duke you can’t help but fall in love with and a teacher who you would want to teach your own children. She makes you laugh out loud and grumble under your breath while giving her characters advice and a twist you never saw coming.Author Donna Alam is a one-click author for me.

Alexander is older, incredibly sexy & (bonus) a Scottish duke = great male character to fantasize about! I love the different points of view from both Alexander & Holland. Most books are from the female p.o.v, but this provides insight on Alexander’s thoughts & feelings. Love that. This is an amazing & sexy read & the cover is very hot! Do not, repeat, do not ever change that cover. Every time I read Alexander’s POV & thoughts, I imagined the guy on the cover & it made him even sexier!\n\n', '\n\n  A positively engaging and passionate book! Alexander and Hollands story is tempting, heartwarming and consuming. Undeniably one of my best reads of the year.

A good writer who made choices I just didn’t enjoy.\n\n', '\n\n  This book is everything...It has the perfect amount of love, angst, steamy scenes.

[a] captivating and slyly subversive fictional paean to the real women whose work on the Oxford English Dictionary went largely unheralded.”—The New York Times Book Review WINNER OF THE AUSTRALIAN BOOK INDUSTRY AWARD • “A marvelous fiction about the power of language to elevate or repress.”—Geraldine Brooks, New York Times bestselling author of People of the BookEsme is born into a world of words. Motherless and irrepressibly curious, she spends her childhood in the Scriptorium, an Oxford garden shed in which her father and a team of dedicated lexicographers are collecting words for the very first Oxford English Dictionary. Young Esme’s place is beneath the sorting table, unseen and unheard. One day a slip of paper containing the word bondmaid flutters beneath the table. She rescues the slip and, learning that the word means “slave girl,” begins to collect other words that have been discarded or neglected by the dictionary men. As she grows up, Esme realizes that words and meanings relating to women’s and common folks’ experiences often go unrecorded. And so she begins in earnest to search out words for her own dictionary: the Dictionary of Lost Words. To do so she must leave the sheltered world of the university and venture out to meet the people whose words will fill those pages. Set during the height of the women’s suffrage movement and with the Great War looming, The Dictionary of Lost Words reveals a lost narrative, hidden between the lines of a history written by men. Inspired by actual events, author Pip Williams has delved into the archives of the Oxford English Dictionary to tell this highly original story. The Dictionary of Lost Words is a delightful, lyrical, and deeply thought-provoking celebration of words and the power of language to shape the world.

A friend in Australia sent me a copy of this book as she thought I\'d enjoy it.  I didn\'t just enjoy it, I loved this book.  I loved Esme and her story,  I loved the words and it was interesting to learn how women\'s words (and women themselves) were invisible in the late 1800\'s and later.  This book is based on the Oxford English Dictionary and the work involved in making it and the people involved in the words.  Now that sounds quite dry and that is just the opposite of what the book was like.  A number of reviewers said the book was ""original"" and that is the perfect descriptor of this book.  The women who people this novel are extraordinary, even in their ordinariness.  Such a wonderful read.\n\n', '\n\n  When I was young and I asked my mother how to spell a word she would say “Look it up in the dictionary.” And I would reply I can’t because I can’t spell it.” This historical fiction covers the years 1886 to 1989 and significant events told through the words of Esme Nicoll.At age five she introduces us to the Oxford English Dictionary and how it is compiled, how decisions are made on what words are included and, more importantly, the words, mainly words related too and used by women are omitted. Her father is one of the associates and her first relationship with the dictionary’s workings is sitting under the work table and picking up the discarded slips.Esme becomes friends with an actress who introduces her to the world of the protesting suffragettes. Not a place where she is comfortable and she struggles with what actions in which she can become involved. This friendship leaves another major mark on Esme’s life.The third event is World War One which has a major impact of the progress of the dictionary as young men enlist. Her wedding to Gareth, a compositor with the Oxford University Press who is working on the dictionary takes place before he goes to the front. It also leads her to a new use of words and language working with soldiers who have lost the ability to speak as a result of what they suffered in battle.The dictionary is finally completed in November, 1928 and work has already started on the first of several supplements before the second edition is released in 1989. This is a historical novel for people who love words. The ending brought tears to my eyes.I don’t always read the Afterwords and Acknowledgments but in this case I urge you do so as the history of the dictionary continues. They identify the historical people and reinforce the true activities that are in the novel.Reviewed June 23, 2021\n\n']"

  The updated edition of the bestselling book that has changed millions of lives with its insights into the growth mindset“Through clever research studies and engaging writing, Dweck illuminates how our beliefs about our capabilities exert tremendous influence on how we learn and which paths we take in life.”—Bill Gates, GatesNotes After decades of research, world-renowned Stanford University psychologist Carol S. Dweck, Ph.D., discovered a simple but groundbreaking idea: the power of mindset. In this brilliant book, she shows how success in school, work, sports, the arts, and almost every area of human endeavor can be dramatically influenced by how we think about our talents and abilities. People with a fixed mindset—those who believe that abilities are fixed—are less likely to flourish than those with a growth mindset—those who believe that abilities can be developed. Mindset reveals how great parents, teachers, managers, and athletes can put this idea to use to foster outstanding accomplishment. In this edition, Dweck offers new insights into her now famous and broadly embraced concept. She introduces a phenomenon she calls false growth mindset and guides people toward adopting a deeper, truer growth mindset. She also expands the mindset concept beyond the individual, applying it to the cultures of groups and organizations. With the right mindset, you can motivate those you lead, teach, and love—to transform their lives and your own.

There are plenty of examples provided in the chapters, so it’s fairly easy to find a parallel you can relate to.Additionally, the author doesn’t just talk about a theoretical concept, but rather provides some good actionable steps to actually start working on getting a growth mindset.I would recommend reading this if you’re feeling stuck or stagnant. A mindset shift might be the thing you need to unblock yourself and move forward.\n\n', '\n\n  This is for me the main book to help anyone change their mindset. It helped me understand how I can change my approach to what is happening around me. The following quote fits perfectly:""Man’s mind, stretched to a new idea, never goes back to its original dimension."" Oliver Wendell HolmesStill I/ we need to work on this new approach daily. Like anything else we pursue in life, we need to work at it and get better. Carol is setting us on an incredible journey and we should all be excited to go along as far as possible\n\n', '\n\n  Reading this book with our whole teaching faculty.  Does a wonderful job of explaining growth vs fixed mindsets as well as giving lots of practical examples.  Best strategy we have found is to have faculty read and come prepared to share around one chapter at our monthly faculty meeting.  This has worked really well in terms of people sharing and actually applying learning in their classrooms and in their lives.  Unforeseen byproduct is that it has also given teams a way to openly talk about, address, and gently challenge each other when fixed mindset thinking creeps in.  Very helpful if you have a team that sees constant improvement as a challenge or as a destination (instead of an ongoing journey).  Strongly recommend.\n\n']"

Besides the fact that I received books from her Throne of Glass and ACOTAR series, and haven't taken the plunge, everyone and their mama has recommended her books to me. I have NO excuse! But what is good about the fact that I'm ignorant about all things SJM... it means I have nothing of hers to compare it to. Her characters reminded me of no one. Her storyline didn't feel overplayed. It was all brand new to me and it was wonderful!Let me just say... House of Earth and Blood is bloody brilliant! It's addictive, it's entrancing, and I'm so absolutely in love with this looooooong introduction to her Crescent City series!!\n\n"", '\n\n  It is a hard book to read, so much of it is about heartache and oppression and wanting our own freedom and errors and redemption and finding something to live for.After reading the first chapter, I did not find the FMC lovable at all. It took me a while. Same thing for the MMC. But this book is about a journey for him, for redemption. For her it is about us seeing deeper than her skin, seeing how much she loves and is loyal when she does love and is this incredible person. It was painful reading this but it stays with you a while and makes you think deep thoughts and this just proves that Sarah J. Mass is a really good author. I don’t like reading painful things but I had to finish the book. I’m still debating if I’ll buy the next one for this reason.\n\n', '\n\n  His book, like the rest of her books, has completely stripped me bare. The emotional roller coaster of this books was superbly written. I laughed and cried and screamed and cried some more when the book ended. Can’t wait for the next book.One thing I will say is that for her first venture into full romance it lacked a bit. The sexual tension was there and the language change for the demographic was there but it is a slow burn romance. Hopefully we get some juicy stuff in the next one.\n\n', ""\n\n  Oh my goodness, this was fabulous!  While certainly in a different world/realm setting than her court series, this was an amazing story that perfectly answered the question of what happens to a world steeped in magic as it evolves into the future. All the inventions and technology that comes with industrial revolution,  but the wonder and peril that makes a magical society. The characters were multifaceted and complex, and even having the main characters experience the weaknesses common to our society, it's always wonderful to read books where the good guys aren't perfect.\n\n"", '\n\n  Wow. I just finished reading the ACOTAR series and there was a hole in my life. So I downloaded this book thinking nothing could beat it. Well, I was wrong! This book was so well written, the storyline was so consuming I could not put this book down.The characters all pull you in and now I’m sad I have to wait to Feb 2022 for the next book. Read this book, it’ll go above your expectations!!\n\n', '\n\n  Loved it. Loved it loved it. I read this book in four days. In between work, kids, working out and general household stuff that I mostly put on hold to read this book. I had to sacrifice sleep and the quality of my work but it was worth it. It was a lot of info to digest in the beginning but this book started as a slow roll and ended in a lighting fast smack right in the feels. Wow.\n\n', ""\n\n  This book was so amazing I don't know if I can properly word it! I will admit the first couple of chapters were information overload but then it just took off. I've read Sarah J. Maas's other book series (ACOTAR & TOG) and I didn't think she could top the Court of Thornes and Roses, but I'd have to flip a coin to decide. It will be agony waiting for the next book.\n\n"", ""\n\n  my first review indicated that t the first few chapters were hard to follow. this is the only reason i gave it a 4.Sarah's creativity speaks volumes, her talent in describing scenes makes you see the picture. there were times where i believed what the outcome was... spolier alert... she artfully keeps you guessing.. a complete page turner. there were some moments where the swearing did not feel right, but if that's how the characters spoke to her while she was writing, then i cant fault her for that. looking forward to the next book.\n\n""]"

I loved the unashamed sex and appreciation by the various men for their women.

Ash isn’t quite a full-on gothic hero, he’s just too sweet, but he does share many of their defining traits. He’s a bit of a loner with a tragic backstory and the love of the right woman makes him even greater than he already was. I enjoyed reading about this group of characters and I’m looking forward to learning more about them in the next book.The Gift of the MarquessWow. There’s quite a lot going on here. And for anyone who has struggled with fertility issues, this story could be considered slightly triggering. Poppy and Gabriel are fantastic characters. Having been married for several years now, they’ve already made it past most of the worst miscommunication problems that often plague the newly wedded. That doesn’t mean their journey is all smooth sailing though; they still have their moments of ‘humans behaving badly’ where they don’t talk the issues through. No matter what else is going on, it’s easy to feel the love these two have for one another. I thought their emotional vulnerability came across as very realistic and I loved that both characters had growth they needed to accomplish. I felt that their issues resolved a bit too easily, but I realize that it happens that way in real life on a fairly regular basis. I’m dying to see what happens in the next book now.Joy to the DukeWhat a fascinating twist on A Christmas Carol. Calder and Felicity had the last ten years of their happiness stolen from them when his father schemed to keep them apart. My heart broke for this pair over the grief and pain caused by the old duke, but I loved watching all the trouble Felicity went to in order to thaw Calder’s heart back out. And in a scene worthy of The Grinch, we even witness Chill’s heart grow three sizes by the end. Now I’m kind of sad to say “goodbye” to these siblings and their extended families.I received complimentary copies of the books in the set.\n\n']"

There are those special books that come into a reader’s life, the ones that tug at your heartstrings, pull you in, completely captivate you, and give you everything that you could have possibly hoped for in a book.  Look the Part was that book for me.  When I began reading it, I didn’t want to put it down.  When I wasn’t reading it, I was constantly thinking about the story and the characters and counting down the minutes until I would be able to return to this beautiful, all-consuming story.From beginning to end, this book owned my heart.  Look the Part is my definition of a well-rounded contemporary romance.  It just has it all.  It is filled with humor, great dialogue and banter, chemistry, tons of emotion, and that push and pull between the characters that offers up all of the tension that I enjoy.I felt an instant connection to the characters, not because my life mirrored theirs or because I shared their experiences, but because of the care that the author took in creating them.  They were real, emotional, flawed, and I was rooting for them from the very first page.  The whole cast of characters was done to perfection, each one adding their own special flair to the story.Whenever I read a book, I want to be invested in the characters and the story, but even more than that, I want to be able to feel everything that the characters are experiencing.  Well, I certainly felt this story.  From the laughter to the squeezing in my heart to the pangs in my stomach, I felt every bit of the joy, heartache, pain, need, and all of the love right along with them.  I wasn’t merely reading the words on the pages, I was living the story.I could go on and on about everything that I loved about Look the Part, but that would take too long.

There aren’t too many books that I say this about, but I wish that I could read it again for the first time.\n\n', '\n\n  This is the first book I’ve read from this author and it was beautiful.  First she’s a good writer but she also offers the readers some jewels of wisdom.  The way she allows feelings to be felt and have their place is something us as women struggle with.  We often rush through our feelings and don’t lead with our hearts.  The plot also was not formulary or overly predictive which was nice.  As a mom of an autistic son, I appreciated her presentation of a family with an autistic child…as well as how she prefaced it at the start of the book.\n\n', '\n\n  This book is one of the best I’ve read in a long while. If I could, I would give it 10 🌟 no hesitation.  Jewel was a new author to me and I bought this book due to the 5 star rating and held on to it for a few months - don’t do that - read it immediately because this read is an experience.  This author just quickly climbed to my top 5 and I read atleast 250 books a year. This story follows Flint, Elle and Harry.  It is filled with so many funny experiences and light moments that I couldn’t put it down but, it also caused the “ugly” tears.  Those moments were quick, thank goodness, but I walked away feeling like I had been uplifted, and had learned a great deal.  It is emotional, but also fun and light; angsty and mysterious and suspenseful and simply wonderful.\n\n', ""\n\n  This book will take you through an emotional rollercoaster ride of emotions. One minute you will be laughing at the quick wit and humorous dialogue then the next you will be grabbing the tissue box as you bleed for the characters. One of Jewel E. Ann's many talents is creating unique characters you can't help but fall in love with, they're not perfect but they are perfectly flawed.If you love a book with all the feels then this is the book for you.\n\n"", '\n\n  I just can’t get enough of Jewel E Ann books.

  A biography examining the final days of Freddie Mercury in the dawn of AIDS and the legacy he left behind. For the first time, the final years of one of the world’s most captivating rock showman are laid bare. Including interviews from Freddie Mercury’s closest friends in the last years of his life, along with personal photographs, Somebody to Love is an authoritative biography of the great man. Here are previously unknown and startling facts about the singer and his life, moving detail on his lifelong search for love and personal fulfilment, and of course his tragic contraction of a then killer disease in the mid-1980s. Woven throughout Freddie’s life is the shocking story of how the HIV virus came to hold the world in its grip, was cruelly labelled “The Gay Plague” and the unwitting few who indirectly infected thousands of men, women and children—Freddie Mercury himself being one of the most famous. The death of this vibrant and spectacularly talented rock star, shook the world of medicine as well as the world of music. Somebody to Love finally puts the record straight and pays detailed tribute to the man himself. “Touts rare—and in some cases, never before seen—images of Mercury and new insight into his life.”—People “The book could be a standalone epidemiological study about the history of HIV/AIDS even without Mercury. But eventually, it weaves him into the timeline, giving a detailed account of his personal life, and his battle with the disease that tragically took him at age 45 in 1991. The result is a powerfully emotional read.”—Rolling Stone  Read more  ","['4.0 out of 5 stars', '4.0 out of 5 stars', '5.0 out of 5 stars', '5.0 out of 5 stars', '5.0 out of 5 stars', '5.0 out of 5 stars', '5.0 out of 5 stars', '4.0 out of 5 stars']","['\nSome Inaccuracies in this book\n', '\nGood but not the best\n', '\nExcellent book about the life of Freddie Mercury\n', '\nWow\n', '\nWell written book\n', '\nAmazing!\n', '\nInteresting read.

He was a GREAT performer but off stage he was a lonely man looking for a meaningful relationship which he found with Jim Hutton but too late.

It is a broad history of Freddie Mercury from his birth through his death and beyond, of Queen from its inception, of all the people who were part of their story and of the fashions, mores, joys and tribulations of the time.

  In the vein of Naomi Novik’s New York Times bestseller Spinning Silver and Katherine Arden’s national bestseller The Bear and the Nightingale, this unforgettable debut— inspired by Hungarian history and Jewish mythology—follows a young pagan woman with hidden powers and a one-eyed captain of the Woodsmen as they form an unlikely alliance to thwart a tyrant. In her forest-veiled pagan village, Évike is the only woman without power, making her an outcast clearly abandoned by the gods. The villagers blame her corrupted bloodline—her father was a Yehuli man, one of the much-loathed servants of the fanatical king. When soldiers arrive from the Holy Order of Woodsmen to claim a pagan girl for the king’s blood sacrifice, Évike is betrayed by her fellow villagers and surrendered.  But when monsters attack the Woodsmen and their captive en route, slaughtering everyone but Évike and the cold, one-eyed captain, they have no choice but to rely on each other. Except he’s no ordinary Woodsman—he’s the disgraced prince, Gáspár Bárány, whose father needs pagan magic to consolidate his power. Gáspár fears that his cruelly zealous brother plans to seize the throne and instigate a violent reign that would damn the pagans and the Yehuli alike. As the son of a reviled foreign queen, Gáspár understands what it’s like to be an outcast, and he and Évike make a tenuous pact to stop his brother.  As their mission takes them from the bitter northern tundra to the smog-choked capital, their mutual loathing slowly turns to affection, bound by a shared history of alienation and oppression. However, trust can easily turn to betrayal, and as Évike reconnects with her estranged father and discovers her own hidden magic, she and Gáspár need to decide whose side they’re on, and what they’re willing to give up for a nation that never cared for them at all.   Read more  ","['3.0 out of 5 stars', '5.0 out of 5 stars', '5.0 out of 5 stars', '4.0 out of 5 stars']","['\nWas almost great\n', '\nUnforgetable\n', '\nOne of the best books I have ever read!!\n', ""\nA great read that I didn't want to put down\n""]","[""\n\n  I found that this book could have been great, could have been one of my favorites. It has fallen short for me however. I didn't mind that much of the book was slow paced, or that relationships weren't as deeply fleshed out as some other books. The lore was interesting when we got it, the characters were good and I didn't even mind the enemies to lovers romance (despite it not being my go to and more a thing I avoid). So for about 75% of this book I was having a great time. I read the entire novel in a few hours. But the ending was where it fell apart for me.The ending was rushed. Boy did everything happen fast. Which could have been fine, except the pacing of the entire rest of the book didn't match. It was paced more like a book in a series than a standalone. From what I could find via google this book isn't a series. I could be wrong, but it still makes no sense why the ending just suddenly happened. We spend the majority of the book on character growth (overcoming ingrained cultural hate and personal struggles) while they hunt for what is basically a macguffin. Which was all perfectly fine. I'm always up for a good macguffin when it is done right. The thing that was weird with this one? We go through so much pain and the main character pays the price for obtaining it and...the enemy just happens to be there. They just happen to catch them, and then one of the very bad dudes takes the macguffin. And...it is promptly forgotten. Seriously, this thing was not useful in the least. As far as I could tell, it got left on the table. Within a chapter or two, they manage to defeat the one who was set up as the big bad who was practically unkillable. Okay, cool. Except they do nothing differently? He just happens to die this time? Or did they hit his Achille's ankle no one knew he had? This still could have been saved had the rest of the ending not followed. Nothing becomes concrete, the main relationship is left open ended. The options given to them are crap and it leaves you with the feeling of 'this is as good as it gets'. It felt like the book was pointless. There was very little actual change that happened besides a small group of people's feelings to another group and a change of kings.It left me asking why I had read it, and being frustrated with how things turned out. Maybe it just wasn't my book, and that is fair. It wasn't bad, but it wasn't special either. And I shouldn't have to put this part in, but I feel like I should. You don't get to abuse someone for their entire life, treat them as disposable garbage, and then be redeemed for showing up. Just no. Your one semi good deed does not erase years of torment. You have to earn your redemption and that is not up to you. I get too that the victim can 'love' the abusers. But giving you the bare necessities of life so they can one day use you is not worthy of your love. Loyalty to your people and what they stand for? Sure. But the main character loves them? if the rest of the ending hadn't already ruined my mood this alone would have.It is a dark read that is full of abuse, self harm and sacrifice with very little pay off to make it worth it. I would still encourage you to give it a try as books are extremely subjective and it might be perfect to someone else. But if you are unsure in any way I would try a library first. Or a sale.\n\n"", ""\n\n  There are some books you can't put down. They catch you from your first breath and carry you away into the night until your eyes burn and fingers cramp. You are hopelessly enchanted. This is one such book. Every word, every phrase, lifts us upward into magic and a winter world that is at once both foriegn and yet familiar. Bravo Ava Reid, you are a master wordsmith. All I want to know is - when is the next book coming out?\n\n"", '\n\n  I just couldn’t put the book down. The world the author has created is so intricate. I could get lost in it forever.\n\n', '\n\n  Maybe it\'s because I\'ve been just slogging through some other fantasy-type stories lately, but I was blown away by how gripping The Wolf and the Woodsman\'s tale was from the very beginning. It didn\'t take a quarter of the book for me to ""get into it"". It was a very enjoyable read. If I have any gripes, it\'s that I did notice some repetitive phrases throughout. Things like fear or anger ""coiling in my chest"", for example - great imagery the first time, good the second time, and kind of lost meaning every time after that. So is it the BEST written book? Probably not, but the pace, action sequences, occasional creepiness (there\'s one monster in there that was absolutely terrifying to read at 2 a.m.), even the political intrigue and religious allegories made the entire book well worth reading.\n\n']"

  An indolent college student creates a chaotic fictional world in this classic of Irish literature: “A marvel of imagination, language, and humor” (New Republic).   In this comic masterpiece, our unnamed narrator—a student at University College, Dublin, who spends more time drinking and working on his novel than attending classes—creates a character, a pub owner named Trellis, who himself is devoted mainly to writing and sleeping. Soon Trellis is collaborating with an author of cowboy romances, and from there unspools a brilliantly unpredictable adventure that James Joyce himself called “a really funny book.”   “’Tis the odd joke of modern Irish literature—of the three novelists in its holy trinity, James Joyce, Samuel Beckett and Flann O’Brien, the easiest and most accessible of the lot is O’Brien. . . . Flann O’Brien was too much his own man, Ireland’s man, to speak in any but his own tongue.” —The Washington Post   “As with Scott Fitzgerald, there is a brilliant ease in [O’Brien’s] prose, a poignant grace glimmering off every page.” —John Updike   “One of the best books of our century.” —Graham Greene     Read more  ","['5.0 out of 5 stars', '2.0 out of 5 stars', '5.0 out of 5 stars', '5.0 out of 5 stars', '5.0 out of 5 stars', '5.0 out of 5 stars']","['\nAn absorbing, high quality book\n', '\nNonsense\n', ""\nFlann O'Brien\n"", '\nA Masterpiece!

Think of it as Pirandello meets  the Marx Brothers.""At Swim-Two-Birds"" delights in rapid-fire  wordplay and sophomoric experimentation (there are three alternative  beginnings to the story).  O\'Brien succeeds in this bombastic flair partly  because he doesn\'t take the literary enterprise--his own included--too  seriously.  He  races along at a Groucho-like pace, only to slow down in  wonderfully overwritten and overwrought scenes:""Together the two  strong men, joyous in the miracle of their health, put their bulging thews  and the fine ripple of their sinews together at the arm-pits of the  stricken king as they bent over him with their grunting red faces, their  four heels sinking down in the turf of the jungle with the stress of their  fine effort as they hoisted the madman to the tremulous support of his  withered legs.""Indeed!James Joyce praised O\'Brien as  ""a real author, with the true comic spirit,"" and Graham Greene  called this ""a book in a thousand....in the line of Tristram Shandy  and Ulysses.""  Like Joyce, O\'Brien dazzles us with language and the  sheer sound of words. The narrative is interrupted with rhetorical notes  (""Name of figure of speech: Litotes [or Meiosis]""), populated by  varying narrators ""Tour de force by Brinsley, vocally interjected,  being a comparable description in the Finn canon:,"" and buoyed by  dialogue that variously recalls 30\'s screwball comedies,B-movie Westerns,  and bad courtroom dramas.O\'Brien himself offers some literary  ""theory"" that illustrates his comic sensibility and offers sly  clues for his delighted (and maybe perplexed) reader:  ""...a  satisfactory novel should be a self-evident sham to which the reader could  regulate at will the degree of his credulity,"" and, ""Most authors  spend their time saying what has been said before--usually said much better  (Page 33)."" Flann O\'Brien\'s command of--and upending of--narrative  forms, and the hilarity of his farce make this an essential addition to any  comic library.  Then again, I could be wrong.(Buy it!)\n\n', '\n\n  ""You have left your reader behind,"" James Joyce told Flann, while, as Flann himself put it, he brandished ""Finnegan\'s Wake in his left hand.""  This is the most brilliant book I have read in years, something I read from beginning to end, going back, going over again, laughing out loud in the bathtub.  This book has done things contemporary writers are still afraid to approach, and it will go on that way, because Flann O\'Brien was daring and inventive and made Irish literature his home and Irish literature must thank him for that.\n\n', '\n\n  Excellent copy of the book, mailed in solid packaging, arrived safely and within a week of ordering.

This a dark bully romance and TWs include attempted rape, physical abuse, sexual abuse, toxic masculinity, and just about any other TW you can think of. These are potentially harmful topics so if you are sensitive to any of these matters PLEASE educate yourself before reading.That being said, this author did a fantastic job of weaving all these topics through an exciting and sexy narrative. The story follows Rika Fane, a young woman whos finally about to spread her wings and make a name for herself, beyond the one she was born into and the people around her who do nothing but coddle her. But Rika knows she is so much more. And Michael Crist, a devilishly handsome and dangerous man has seen that fire in her eyes too. They've grown up together, orbiting around each other but never really making a move. Michael knows she likes to play the game and in her, he's found a formidable opponent. Amidst their whirlwind sexual escapades, through a narrative that alternates between present-day and 3 years prior, we discover how something that happened on Devil's Night 3 years ago (Halloween Eve) has changed Rika and Michael's lives forever, as well as Michael's friends Kai, Damon, and Will. Rika betrayed them all, and they demand revenge.This book is a roller coaster. You will find yourself loving and simultaneously hating every character. Rika is rash but she fights for what she wants. Michael has serious anger issues (for real I hope at the end of this book he goes to some therapy) but he's loyal till the end. His friends, however problematic they are and their desire to take what isn't theirs, are a product of the white rich American suburbs. I don't know if Douglas did this intentionally, but I found this book as almost a critique of toxic masculinity and its presence not only in high school but the world beyond those gated communities. Michael and his friends, for most of their lives, are able to evade any repercussions of their actions. They destroy and wreak havoc because they can. But in the end, your past always catches up with you.Truthfully, I enjoyed the romance. I won't apologize for liking a novel with problematic themes because I don't think that's fair. Its like kink (which btw this book has a lot of!!!), just because you enjoy it between the sheets doesn't mean you'll stand for it in the streets. But also, maybe you do and that's totally fine!! Either way, its ok to like books maybe society says you shouldn't. Reading is about pleasure and enjoyment, and this book definitely brought me that.The sex scenes were A1, probably the best I have ever read before. The building tension and romance were sickeningly delicious. If you're a fan of Douglas' other works or just dark smutty thriller romances in general.. you will devour this!\n\n"", '\n\n  🌟 🌟 🌟 🌟 🌟 (5/5 Stars)“𝑂𝑤𝑛 𝑖𝑡, 𝑜𝑟 𝑖𝑡 𝑤𝑖𝑙𝑙 𝑜𝑤𝑛 𝑦𝑜𝑢.“ - 𝐶𝑜𝑟𝑟𝑢𝑝𝑡 𝑏𝑦 𝑃𝑒𝑛𝑒𝑙𝑜𝑝𝑒 𝐷𝑜𝑢𝑔𝑙𝑎𝑠Do you ever buy a book and then hold off reading it for one reason or another and then you finally pick up the book and you’re kicking yourself for not having done it sooner? If so, then you understand me, because that is exactly what happened to me with Corrupt!!🤩Let me just say, this book is AMAZING!! 🙌🏻This was my first dark romance read and it was the perfect ice breaker into the dark romance trope! Corrupt, was dark and suspenseful, but not so dark that I was uncomfortable. Penelope balanced this book perfectly!👌🏻As soon as I picked up this book, I was hooked and became more and more enthralled as the book progressed!😍 Penelope seamlessly transitioned between past and present with this book, giving you just enough information to keep you guessing and at the edge of your seat without giving away too much. (Like I said, Pen kills it with the Balance in this book!)The world Penelope created with this book completely blows my mind, the whole concept is truly phenomenal and unique. The hero, Michael, and the heroine, Rika in this book were amazing! I loved the push and pull between them and the side characters omg I can’t wait for their books!\xa0 Also, if you guys like steamy scenes, this has one of the HOTTEST scenes I have ever read!!🔥🔥🔥\xa0If you like dark romance books, that keep you on the edge of you seat with twists, steam, and having your mind blown, I highly recommend this book!❤️\n\n', '\n\n  Book 1 in the Devil’s Night Series, the story of Michael and Rika.

Michael with the help of his friends Kai, Will and Damon who make up the group called the Horsemen just got out of jail and are about to set in motion the revenge plan on Rika who just happens to be the gal who betrayed them all on Devil’s Night sending 3 of the 4 of them to jail for three years.

All I can say is you have to read it to understand the dept of it\n\n', '\n\n  Intriguing, captivating and mysterious. I loved the back and forth between past and present, and Rika’s and Michael’s POV. Details are given so sparingly that the reader is kept guessing and wondering what happened that last night.

  #1 NEW YORK TIMES BESTSELLER • PULITZER PRIZE FINALIST • This inspiring, exquisitely observed memoir finds hope and beauty in the face of insurmountable odds as an idealistic young neurosurgeon attempts to answer the question What makes a life worth living? NAMED ONE OF PASTE’S BEST MEMOIRS OF THE DECADE • NAMED ONE OF THE BEST BOOKS OF THE YEAR BY The New York Times Book Review • People • NPR • The Washington Post • Slate • Harper’s Bazaar • Time Out New York • Publishers Weekly • BookPage Finalist for the PEN Center USA Literary Award in Creative Nonfiction and the Books for a Better Life Award in Inspirational MemoirAt the age of thirty-six, on the verge of completing a decade’s worth of training as a neurosurgeon, Paul Kalanithi was diagnosed with stage IV lung cancer. One day he was a doctor treating the dying, and the next he was a patient struggling to live. And just like that, the future he and his wife had imagined evaporated. When Breath Becomes Air chronicles Kalanithi’s transformation from a naïve medical student “possessed,” as he wrote, “by the question of what, given that all organisms die, makes a virtuous and meaningful life” into a neurosurgeon at Stanford working in the brain, the most critical place for human identity, and finally into a patient and new father confronting his own mortality. What makes life worth living in the face of death? What do you do when the future, no longer a ladder toward your goals in life, flattens out into a perpetual present? What does it mean to have a child, to nurture a new life as another fades away? These are some of the questions Kalanithi wrestles with in this profoundly moving, exquisitely observed memoir. Paul Kalanithi died in March 2015, while working on this book, yet his words live on as a guide and a gift to us all. “I began to realize that coming face to face with my own mortality, in a sense, had changed nothing and everything,” he wrote. “Seven words from Samuel Beckett began to repeat in my head: ‘I can’t go on. I’ll go on.’” When Breath Becomes Air is an unforgettable, life-affirming reflection on the challenge of facing death and on the relationship between doctor and patient, from a brilliant writer who became both.

In 'When Breath Becomes Air,' Kalanithi accounts his transition from his childhood and the path that drew him towards an initially unlikely career in medicine through the end of residency, and ultimately the tragic derailment of a once promising outlook. Beyond the difficulty of dealing with terminal illness, the author is able to find some answers about what it means to live a life fully, however imperfect it may be.As an aspiring doctor and having been impacted by a familial death from lung cancer around the time of my reading this, there are many passages in the story that resonated with me. At times it required me to put the book down to really process the feelings that I had, and to understand on a deep level the vulnerabilities we all experience as human beings. I will always appreciate the impact of Paul's story on my own maturing perspective.\n\n"", '\n\n  I don\'t normally write book reviews. But I am super compelled to write one.Paul\'s brave story of journeying through med-school and facing lung cancer, was so inspiring and real.The book is well-written, with a table-spoon of medical jargon (but made me feel intelligent nonetheless), and get\'s to the point without droning on irrelevant details.I personally think the book could have been longer and detailed more in his life as a neurologist and the challenges of the practice. However, his whole book was based on ""to what degree should we sustain life, if there isn\'t much quality or value of life remaining"".This is a must-read for everyone. Helps us realize our mortality, and the realization that bravery comes through vulnerability.\n\n', '\n\n  This is an exploration by an intelligent, highly accomplished neurosurgeon who searched for the real purpose of life by studying and fixing the brain. The miracle of the brain’s workings could hold answers to help humanity understand it’s purpose. The reader travels with him on the intellectual paths he takes with humor, compassion and love. We also travel with him on his journey with an incurable disease, at a tragically young age,  that forces him to face his mortality with the wisdom.I loved this book. It is not religious as so many of this type of books are. It is a deep exploration into topics that help us lead a richer life and a more peaceful and accepting death.\n\n', ""\n\n  I cried so much reading this book. Personally I did an English Specialist with a Psychology Major. I've never quite felt right after graduating and constantly unsure of what to do. But Kalanithi presents such a beautiful memoir that there is real potential for cross-disciplinary understanding that the patient and physician are at the end of the day human- that there's real pain and emotion that only when you inhabit both roles that you start to see that even as we are dying and understanding every unique detail and facet of why we are dying: we can't come to grips with the fact that we absolutely love the world. I have lent this book out immediately after finishing it realizing that how fragile life is, how easy it is to forget that the love of wisdom, the love of psychology, the love of literature: it's all just the love of living. I think even as he described time and space senses erosion as he got sicker that he never stopped loving what he does, the people around him- the fact this memoir is littered with literary and psychological references and even humour just makes it more meaningful- what we know is how little we know and how much still needs to be researched. I hope his wife and his colleagues take the time to keep trying to answer what Paul Kalanithi couldn't in the time he worked and in the time he wrote.\n\n"", '\n\n  Moving, insightful and easy to read.Following Kalanithi on his short journey to the end we all experience, the book is. once illuminating and intensely private. He shares the science, the philosophy, the emotions of imminent death,  in a skilfully written autobiography of the last two years of his life. At a time when he begins the final year of learning his specialty, he is struck by lightning with a diagnosis of inoperable cancer.  Most intriguing is the final chapter written by his wife after he has died. She comes to realize that love doesn’t die even when a loved one has.\n\n', ""\n\n  I was recommended this by a friend who found himself in the same situation - a physician who had what could be a mass detected during a checkup. While he has a happy ending to his story, this is a heartbreaking story of a life that comes to an end too soon and what goes through your mind when you see it coming and can't do anything to stop it.It should be depressing, and you may well find bits here and there that leave you incredibly sad, but overall this is a story about enjoying what you have while you have it and making the most of your opportunities no matter what might come next.\n\n"", ""\n\n  I really loved this book. It is the type of book that needs to be read more than once as one gets tied up in it emotionally and thereby you miss a lot of the more precious meaning that it is trying to convey. It made me sad as here was a man with great intellect that was lost too soon. It was obvious that he was set to work out some of life's deeper philosophical questions. His wide breadth of education and study would have enabled him to give some of us the understanding with some of the deeper of life's questions that we ask but are not able to find an answer to. I believe he would have been able to do that for us and for that reason I mourn his loss. The book is very well written and should be read by all.\n\n"", '\n\n  This book was chosen for our book club. I thoroughly enjoyed it and was extremely touched by the authors honesty and openness about his journey to self discovery in terms of practicing medicine and in realizing the kind of practitioner he wanted to be. The last part of the book, written by his wife, was touching and humbling as she described their journey together. This also gave the reader insight into who he was from the eyes of another. All in all the book was excellent and I felt privileged  to have read it.\n\n']"

  The 1948 crime film The Naked City (later a television show) ended with this iconic line There are eight million stories in the naked city.” Things have not changed either before or since: every era and neighborhood is full of true tales and legends about which even residents are likely to be unaware. Strange And Obscure Stories Of New York City takes the reader on a breathtaking tour of the five boroughs in search of these accounts. Some are eerily fascinating in their own right while others explain how the city became the great metropolis that it is.Before the World Trade Center 9/11 tragedy, the aftermath of a fire aboard the steamboat General Slocum in the East River was the city’s greatest disaster. The 1904 event occurred during an outing for a church group. The loss of life1,021 out of the 1,358 passengersdevastated the German-America community that inhabited Manhattan’s East Village. To escape bad memories, they relocated to the Upper East Side’s Yorkville, the reason why that neighborhood became celebrated for its German restaurants, stores, and breweries.On July 23, 1886, not long after the Brooklyn Bridge opened, a 23-year-old named Steve Brodie announced that he survived a 150-foot drop from that span into the East River. (A liquor dealer offered to back a saloon that Brodie wanted to open but only if he took the risk). Although there were no witnesses, news of the alleged jump made headlines, with The New York Times supporting Brodie’s claim, and the phrase pull a Brodie,” meaning to try a dangerous stunt, entering popular parlance.Then too are the unsolved murders, ghost stories, urban legends (are there indeed alligators living in the sewers?), and hidden histories that are all part of this lively and captivating chronicle of the world’s greatest city.Skyhorse Publishing, as well as our Arcade imprint, are proud to publish a broad range of books for readers interested in history--books about World War II, the Third Reich, Hitler and his henchmen, the JFK assassination, conspiracies, the American Civil War, the American Revolution, gladiators, Vikings, ancient Rome, medieval times, the old West, and much more.

  #1 NEW YORK TIMES BESTSELLER • In her latest book, Brené Brown writes, “If we want to find the way back to ourselves and one another, we need language and the grounded confidence to both tell our stories and be stewards of the stories that we hear. This is the framework for meaningful connection.”In Atlas of the Heart, Brown takes us on a journey through eighty-seven of the emotions and experiences that define what it means to be human. As she maps the necessary skills and an actionable framework for meaningful connection, she gives us the language and tools to access a universe of new choices and second chances—a universe where we can share and steward the stories of our bravest and most heartbreaking moments with one another in a way that builds connection. Over the past two decades, Brown’s extensive research into the experiences that make us who we are has shaped the cultural conversation and helped define what it means to be courageous with our lives. Atlas of the Heart draws on this research, as well as on Brown’s singular skills as a storyteller, to show us how accurately naming an experience doesn’t give the experience more power—it gives us the power of understanding, meaning, and choice. Brown shares, “I want this book to be an atlas for all of us, because I believe that, with an adventurous heart and the right maps, we can travel anywhere and never fear losing ourselves.”   Read more  ","['5.0 out of 5 stars', '5.0 out of 5 stars', '5.0 out of 5 stars', '3.0 out of 5 stars', '5.0 out of 5 stars', '5.0 out of 5 stars', '4.0 out of 5 stars']","['\nA roadmap to a better self, not a book of answers, only you have answers with the provided map.\n', ""\nGoogle her, she'll change your life\n"", '\nBeautifully presented and written\n', '\nI like the book but it arrived damaged.\n', '\nA fabulous book.\n', '\nN/A\n', '\nA great resource for mapping emotions!\n']","['\n\n  Lets be open about how I see Brene Brown.  I have read all her books, many twice.  For those who know her other material you know you are going to cry at some point.

I have now purchased it on kindle for the purpose of further study and portability.  However also for the the additional purpose of leaving a review.  I want to leave a review because I see other reviews that are completely missing the point.  This book is a map not a book of answers.

It is scary, painful, but in a certain way provides the elation of freedom after going through the pain.Thanks to Brene and her team for this.I have now finished the book over a two day read marathon.  My opinion of the content has not changed.  Still very positive.  As noted this becomes your own personal journey, I found it worthwhile and will re-read the book again very soon.  Yes, I found it that important.An interesting thing about the physical book and all it’s emotional content I found myself stroking the book and pages as if to make a connection with the book.

Years ago, when I first started trying to tune into my emotions I did research to compile a list of all known and named emotions and their definitions.  I used it to be more attuned to my feelings, and have used it to help my children and others do the same.  I wish this book would have been in print at that time.  Unlike the hyped expectations of some others which seemed to fall flat, I read just looking to see what was offered, and found it informative, touching, and beautiful.  This book will not save or fix your relationships, but it could help you follow the instructions of the emperor Trajan, “Know Thyself”.  I deducted a single star for Brenè’s justification of Joy in the “justice” of others’ wrong doing.  I realize she can’t help but have the western view of justice, but the ancient views of justice coupled with indigenous and other cultures’ beliefs show a much more ‘’connected” view of justice, where it’s objective is to reconcile the wrong doer and help them heal, rather than punish them.  I guess I was just surprised to see that slip up, given her focus and love of connection.  I’m glad she’s not writing a review of my life’s work, though.  I’m sure there would be many more incongruencies and flaws than I have found in hers.  All in all, a beautiful resource for assistance in emotional mapping.  I highly recommend it.\n\n']"

Bottom line, is it bad? No. I think it’s complicated, too dark, and could have drawn more strength in other areas, but when i shines, it truly shines.Auren isn’t like most leading ladies in dark fantasy. After being a prisoner for a decade and being brain washed, I was able to understand and sympathize with her. Yes, she is physically weak and naive, but it was never her fault and I always supported her because she tries. Her story is just beginning and while she isn’t seen as anything other than a prize, I do think she has a ton of development ahead of her.The world building is very engaging and I wanted to sped a lot more time with it, especially when the Fae element came into it. There is so much to be explored in this realm and I would hope it plays a major part in future books.As far as story and pacing, it didn’t go quite the way I imagined. All things considered, this was a really slow book that focused more on making the reader understand Auren and how she thinks above anything else.Now comes the other stuff. The dark stuff. There is a ton of shock value in GILD. Literally one male is decent, and the others are disgusting. Three lines in this book made me physically cringe. Every woman is treated horribly. There is an assault scene in here that served a very loose purpose.And the thing is, none of it was needed. It rarely advanced the plot, which is the only time shocking elements ought to be used. I understand that characters will act how they will act and this a dark fantasy romance. But I don’t think the execution of these particular scenes were quite as impactful as Kennedy hoped for.So does that make the book bad? No. Honestly, aside from that final brutal scene, it was tamer than I expected. I’d imagine that Auren has an incredible journey of self-discovery ahead. But the slower pace and gratuitous content do make for a bit of a challenging read. This is not a bad book and I am not going to shame the author or the fandom. Everyone likes different things, and I can see why so many readers love this book. I’m even considering continuing with the series. But it may not be for everyone.\n\n', ""\n\n  I kept thinking this would be a story about a girl with Stockholm syndrome awakening/escaping her capture. I got halfway through this book before I had to stop. This is awful! Incredibly abusive and sick. I was nauseous while reading this from the SA or implied SA as well as the forced captivity of the MC. This is honestly such a crap book I'm shocked\n\n"", '\n\n  I’m a huge fan of Ravens books. That being said this one was a little more difficult for me to fall into. It is a dark novel touching on a lot of abuse but it took a lot to get to the action so to speak. But this novel is seriously for me more about building the world and telling history, giving you the background information. It’s gives you a lot of information but still leaves you with questions that need to be answered in the end. I was very interested to see what the next book would bring, and to learn more about Auren, Midas and Rip.\n\n', '\n\n  This was so refreshing and the exact book to get me out of my reading slump! The narration is done so well to paint a clear picture of what life for Auren is actually like vs how auren sees things. I devoured this book and I love the world Raven Kennedy has built. I can’t wait to start the second book!\n\n', ""\n\n  An interesting twist on the tale of King  Midas. The golden touch and endless riches, the conceit of royalty and the horror of imprisonment mixed with a dash of betrayal. The assumptions and stereotypes create a barricade between Auren, the golden precious kept safely in her gilded cage -- like a songbird held captive she yearns to be free, her strong independence is tortured by the distance of every single person from guard to maid, from serf to king -- she is caged, separated from the inhabitants of the castle, the King's entourage and visitors too. She is kept on a high pedestal and untouchable, alone and lonely.\n\n"", '\n\n  I have been curious about this book since it becoming popular all over social media.I give it a 4 because it kept my attention but I’m also not completely sure if I love the book. It was a slow world build with a lot of unanswered questions.The story so far is very gripping and I want to know more so I will read book two but I think I need to feel it out more. Like I want romance and I feel like there has been -100 romanceOk this series reminds me of acotar, get through the first book. It’s good you will just be frustrated because it’s set up for what’s to come. Sooo good\n\n', ""\n\n  This series is so amazing (and it only gets better in the following books)! I can't rave this enough. The change and the character growth Auren goes through was relatable and truly impacted me--I've read books 1-3 and all have made me cry at some point!I know some readers are going to be put off that the plot isn't as romantically driven as some similar books. If you can adjust your expectations (the romance ramps up eventually!) and appreciate that this book and series is about the heroine's journey in inner strength you will, love it as much as i do.Each book builds on the next. If Gild doesn't click with you right away hang on and keep reading, by the end of Gleam you'll see what all the fuss is about.\n\n"", '\n\n  I pretty much loved every minute of this story and was so intrigued right from the beginning with the mythology of King Midus!I’m sort of surprised I enjoyed it as much as I did as it’s not a happy book and also there is a lot of descriptive thoughts/ thinking and less dialogue and I tend to really like dialogue in stories more than anything but Raven is clearly a very very good author/writer!Probably will be starting book #2 ASAP because that cliffhanger gave me all the feels!⚜️⚜️⚜️⚜️⚜️\n\n']"

For people who know me, that's not all that shocking.  I fly my Potter geek flag high.  I adore it and love the fact that Rowling jump started me back into reading back when my kids were small and I thought I had no energy to read.  Her writing is addictive to read and she has the art of bringing her readers into her magical world seamlessly.  I've read the entire series several times and enjoyed all of the movies too.For those of you who have only watched the movies?  You're missing out.  Sure they were amazing but some of the smaller plots were left on the cutting room floor - namely Peeves and the Headless Hunt to name just two in The Chamber of Secrets.  This unabridged e-audiobook version was the perfect way for me to get reacquainted with Potter while walking on the treadmill or driving to work.  The narrator also did a fantastic job with accents and inflections of these highly popular characters.As usual this second book in the HP series is filled a wonderfully magical feel with vibrant and infamous characters.  We have the usual cast of characters as well as the addition on Gilderoy Lockhart who brings some humour with his fascination with ... himself.  I also enjoyed that we get a glimpse into the past of one of Harry's friends and how s/he influenced the Chamber of Secrets.  Overall, the characters themselves are well-rounded and as you progress through the series (and even within each book) you see their development as they struggle with normal tween/teen angst and a whole lot of extra Dark Lord worries t'boot.While this book was my least favourite book in the series I still think it's a great read that pulls readers into Rowling's magical world where she vividly tells her story with humour, suspense and heart.  Readers get a better look at the link between Harry and Voldemort and we see the relationship between Harry and his friends strengthen after the horrible treatment he received from his Aunt and Uncle as well as new new issues at Hogwarts this year.Whether you're 9 or 99 years old, if you're into fantastic world building, characters that come to life, stories about the strength of friendship, the courage to stand up for what is right, the enduring love of a mother and the fact that family is made up of not just blood but also by bonds of friendship then you've got to pick up this series.  No matter what age you are, I'm certain you'll enjoy Harry's world.  Just make sure you read them in order!Highly recommended.My Rating: 5/5 stars**This book review can also be found on my blog, The Baking Bookworm (www.thebakingbookworm.blogspot.ca) where I share hundreds of book reviews and my favourite recipes. **\n\n"", ""\n\n  I loved the audio book as I drive a lot each day for work.

This is considered a DARK romance. Please keep that in mind when reading this book. I’m a huge fan of dark romance and even I found some of these kinks to be a bit extreme. While it may not be for everyone, the author is very respectful of both parties. Don’t rate a book poorly simply because the book is too dark. Know going in... this book will test your limits.Blakely is a junior at Barrington college. This is an elite private college for the children of the world’s wealthiest and most powerful families. Ryat is a senior at the college. Now that he’s passed all of his initiation tests, Ryat is inducted in as a Lord and is expected to select a woman to be his chosen one. The men are asked to abstain from sex until their senior year of college when they become Lords. As a gift for their sacrifice, they are gifted with a chosen one who will be their submissive.Ryat is asked to choose Blakely as his chosen one by the Lords. He starts off by stalking her and inserting himself into her life. When the time comes, Blakely willingly chooses to be with Ryat. Little did she know, that electing to be his chosen one would result in more than she bargained for. The twists and turns of this story will leave you on the edge of your seat.This story has some of the most taboo sex that I have ever read. The author explored forced sex fantasies, breath play, praise kinks among other things. Towards the end of the book… I couldn’t help become affected every time Ryat said “good girl”. Like I mentioned before, certain elements of this story are not my forte; however, the scenes were exceptionally well written. The female character’s best interests were always put first. The author goes on to say that a lot of these fantasies were Blakely’s and that women are often made to feel ashamed of their sexual desires and there is nothing wrong with consensual sex between two adults. I couldn’t put this book down.If you are a fan of dark taboo romance, then I feel like you’re going to enjoy this story. This is enough mystery and intrigue to keep you hooked until the very last line.I was provided an advanced reader copy in exchange for an honest review.\n\n', ""\n\n  It's been 24 hours and my head is still spinning. I read quite a bit of dark romance but this is my first secret society book and I loved it! It's so different from reading mafia or crime dark reads. Shantel put her magic to work and created a world that's so addictive to read that I was literally up until 4am reading. Here's a tip-don't start reading this one past 10pm because you will get sucked into the story, you will get sucked into the amazing characters and you will not be able to resist some of the hottest sex scenes I've ever read!The chemistry between Ryat and Blakely is there from the beginning but what starts as an obligation for him and a revenge tactic for her turns into something real, something that they can rely on and fight for outside of the all the secret society business. Their devotion to each other and the intensity of their feelings-it's just everything!Shantel has outdone herself and between all the heated moments is a story of intrigue, power and the ritualistic foundation that keeps it all going from generation to generation. I enjoyed all the layers of intricate details-the how's, the why's and eventually the WTF moments when things start falling into place.Triggers are aplenty and no, this is not a book for every romance reader but I still say going in blind is best for this one.Shantel has once again left me absolutely hot, bothered and extremely in awe of her talent to take dark romance to another mind-blowing level.\n\n""]"

Here are my personal pros and cons regarding this book:PROS:-The Pareto rule discussed in this book can literally change your perception of so many things. It is for this reason alone, that I got my money’s worth of the book.-It changes your perception of money.-It helps you to READ better. This book took me a year approximately to read. But I didn’t read it for the purpose of simply reading it. I would read a couple of pages and spend a couple of days to a week pondering about the information and APPLYING it (this is so important)!-Time management help for those of us who can’t make up our minds, and waste so much of our lives.-The mindset that Ferris had towards product testing prior to releasing your product(s) is genius. I was originally wanting to purchase products and materials for my business right away but this book helped me to understand HOW I can test the waters with a smaller amount of money before expanding.-This book is perfect for EVERY college/university student. A great read on how to manage your time better while also learning to succeed in your business and/or career. For example, I started to spend just the minimal amount of time to get the best results possible. At the end of the day, a 4.0 for a student consists of a grade value between 85-100 and a student that gets ~85% is probably having a better life than the student who spends extra time on every assessment. And for what? Your 4.0 is assessed with the same view either way.-Essential for individuals who are starting a small business! Gives great outlines to how you can manage your finances better.CONS:-Certain parts of the book are really dry. Feel free to skip certain chapters. Not everything is useful for everyone.-The author has a LOT of unnecessary information. Most people will not be using most of the book's information in their daily lives.-Information on outsourcing is NOT a good idea for individuals of every profession. Out sourcing is not ideal for everyone, so please assess your situation carefully before going about this way. If you are in academia, and word gets around that you are outsourcing your job... you will MOST definitely be fired.-Over a third of the book is about outsourcing! Not necessary and it takes the reader so many chapters to get to a section that doesn't talk about outsourcing.\n\n"", ""\n\n  Total garbage...

  I’m not the same Bebe Grimshaw I was years ago. The woman I was spent years behind the bars of the highest security women’s prison in the nation, my punishment for hacking nuclear codes as part of a crime syndicate I’d gotten in way too deep with. The woman I am today doesn’t regret what I did, or the fact that I got caught, but I am remorseful for the years I lost with my son, Aaron. Released from my sentence early thanks to Kynan McGrath, I joined his team at Jameson Force Security and now put my skills to use helping people.I’m just trying to get back a piece of what I lost, focusing solely on raising Aaron and my work at Jameson. As long as I have my son and my career, I’m content. But life has a funny way of letting you know exactly what you need, and when a devastatingly handsome stranger named Griffin befriends Aaron at the park, I have to consider I might be missing something. A part of me that was locked away long ago reawakens, and I find myself looking at Griff in a way I’ve not looked at a man in more than a decade.Just when I think things are starting to look up, my world is turned upside down. Turns out that meeting wasn’t an accident, and things aren’t going my way at all. Griffin Moore is the man sent here to kill me.

Gundry, author of The Plant ParadoxThe must-have guide to reversing and preventing type 2 diabetes through intermittent fasting and a low-carb, high-fat diet—from Dr. Jason Fung, internationally best selling author of The Obesity Code.Today, most doctors, dietitians, and even diabetes specialists consider type 2 diabetes to be a chronic and progressive disease—a life sentence with no possibility of parole. But the truth, as Dr. Fung reveals in this paradigm-shifting book, is that type 2 diabetes is reversible. Writing with clear, persuasive language, he explains why conventional treatments that rely on insulin or other blood-glucose-lowering drugs can actually exacerbate the problem, leading to significant weight gain and even heart disease. The only way to treat type 2 diabetes effectively, he argues, is proper dieting and intermittent fasting—not medication.

  Rex “TW” McMurtry’s perpetual single-hood wouldn’t bother him so much if all his ex-girlfriends didn’t keep marrying the very next person they dated, especially when so many of those grooms are his closest friends. He may be a pro-football defensive end for the Chicago Squalls, but the press only wants to talk about how he’s always a groomsman and never a groom.

  Book Three of The Guardians Series“You scared her away!” Ellie accused, and Sean realized she was angry.“I nearly broke my bleedin’ neck,” he protested.“Couyon!” Her voice rose. “You’re being ridiculous.” “I barely caught myself,” he insisted. “That monster tree of yours almost took me out!”“This is my home—you need to leave.”“But I just got here.”“You weren’t invited!”“Which I won’t take personally, even though we’re partners and all.”“Partners?” The disbelief on her face was almost comical. “We are not partners!”“Sure we are. You heard Stuart. In tandem. You know what tandem means, don’t you, love?”She pointed at the door. “Go away, Irishman!”“McDougal,” he corrected. “But you can call me Sean.” “Que diriez-vous je vous appelle un idiot!” she snarled, only part of which he understood—idiot translated well enough—and then she closed her eyes and took a deep, ragged breath. Then another. Then she took a careful step back, as if she’d suddenly found herself standing at some dangerous, unknown precipice.Dousing the fire, he thought, oddly disappointed. “I’ve turned my ankle,” he continued, just to poke at her. He limped back a step. “I’ll need to ice it.”Her eyes opened. Fell to his booted foot.“Might be fractured,” he added.“You are a strange and frustrating man,” she said.“Aye,” he agreed somewhat apologetically and smiled at her.★★★     After Ellie Broussard saves Sean McDougal’s son from drowning, she walks away, unwilling to involve herself with the rakish Irishman and his charming boy.  Ellie has suffered a devastating loss, and her world is one of chosen isolation and calculated vengeance.  She has only one focus: to find the monster that stole her child and turn his world to ash.         Sean can relate to Ellie’s suffering.  Having lost his wife to cancer, his sole focus has become raising his boy, and love…well, love can take a long walk.  He’s in Louisiana to locate a cache of stolen art, and even if he’s taken aback—and reluctantly intrigued—by the mysterious and chilly Ellie Broussard, he knows better than to tumble down that rabbit hole.      But when they’re thrown together on assignment to recover the cache, Sean and Ellie have no choice but to put aside their mutual misgivings and work side by side.  To share; to trust; to discover they are not as separate as they appear. And as Ellie’s deadly hunt approaches its culmination, they must risk everything they hold dear to stop a murderer who is readying his next strike, and to save an orphaned girl whose only hope lies in their willingness to defy the darkness and step into the light.★★★★★""A brilliant book with lots of raw emotion, well written, packed with action and brutal honesty.

I gave into temptation and fed the beating beast, which grew thirstier with every slash, every strike, every blow.⁣⁣Triple Falls wasn’t at all what it seemed, nor were the men that swept me under their wing. But in order to keep them, I had to be in on their secrets.⁣⁣Secrets that cost us everything to keep.⁣⁣That’s the novelty of fiction versus reality. You can’t re-live your own love story, because by the time you’ve realized you’re living it, it’s over. At least that was the case for me and the men I trusted my foolish heart to.⁣⁣Looking back, I’m convinced I willed my story into existence due to my illness.⁣⁣And all were punished.This trilogy is a gritty, modern day take on Robin Hood.

  #1 NEW YORK TIMES BESTSELLER • Jack Reacher is back in a brand-new page-turning thriller from acclaimed #1 bestselling authors Lee Child and Andrew Child.Digging graves had not been part of my plans when I woke up that morning. Reacher goes where he wants, when he wants. That morning he was heading west, walking under the merciless desert sun—until he comes upon a curious scene. A Jeep has crashed into the only tree for miles around. A woman is slumped over the wheel. Dead? No, nothing is what it seems. The woman is Michaela Fenton, an army veteran turned FBI agent trying to find her twin brother, who might be mixed up with some dangerous people. Most of them would rather die than betray their terrifying leader, who has burrowed his influence deep into the nearby border town, a backwater that has seen better days. The mysterious Dendoncker rules from the shadows, out of sight and under the radar, keeping his dealings in the dark. He would know the fate of Fenton’s brother. Reacher is good at finding people who don’t want to be found, so he offers to help, despite feeling that Fenton is keeping secrets of her own. But a life hangs in the balance. Maybe more than one. But to bring Dendoncker down will be the riskiest job of Reacher's life. Failure is not an option, because in this kind of game, the loser is always better off dead.

The secondary characters had no depth either. I kept skipping pages because the book didn't hold my attention. The plot made little sense, and the ending was weak. Two stars for the editing. I said the last Reacher novel would be my last. Wish I had listened to myself. I don't mind paying for a good book, but I felt this was way overpriced. Very disappointed.\n\n"", ""\n\n  This was put together by someone who seemed to have thought that sentence fragments added vigour to the writing, despite the fact that the fragmenting was so rampant through most of the book, that it detracted from the meaning.  Perhaps Child's son had read too much about Hemingway, and thought fragments were manly.  I don't know.  At several points, the main writer (presumably the son) lost track of matters such as the time of day, the amount of daylight, and so on. In addition, the book was written in the first person--not a great idea for a Jack Reacher book, since it limits perspective too greatly. I'll never buy another collaboration with the kid.  If Lee Child wants to keep his reputation, he'd better do the writing himself, and send his kid back to the sandbox, since he cannot write.\n\n"", ""\n\n  Complaints in no particular order: 1). When you wait a full year between books we deserve better than 322 pages. 2). Lazy authorship written at an 8th. grade level. 3). A ridiculous plot with an even more ridiculous subplot. I swore my last Reacher book would be the last and it should have been. I'm afraid Reacher, Jack (no middle name) and I have come to the end.\n\n"", '\n\n  I feel like this is blasphemy cuz I’m such a Lee Child fan but I buy the last several books (years) and I find it’s just some exercise in something familiar to do but I don’t find myself entertained.  This is the same. Yawn. I find myself skipping entire paragraphs of redundant or boring prose about what the parking lot looks like in minute detail like he’s killing off pages to be filled. Been this way for a few books. This first person view on this book removed mystique of the character - not enhanced it. Somewhere around book 7 I noticed a larger change like he’s got his mom writing them. I could go into detail of the elements of excitement that changed but why bother. Have you noticed Reacher became asexual 6 books ago. There’s no romantic aspect at all. Did Lee get impotence and now his character is also celibate? Kind of done with this series. This book is particularly bad. High school level writing. That’s a shame\n\n', '\n\n  I’ve read all of Lee Childs books and I  would rate this one close to the bottom of the list. It’s story line is weak and unbelievable in parts, such as. Example, your partner gets his head blown off by a woman and you want to have sex with her before you shoot her. Come on you can do better Lee. The description of all the tunnels becomes monotonous and only takes up space. Lots of tunnels but save us from the boredom of mentioning every turn, it accomplishes nothing. We get it, lots of tunnels. I could go on but I’ve made my point. I’m disappointed. You may be “better off” not to read this one.\n\n', ""\n\n  The setup is seriously confusing. The dialog is stilted, and should not be first person as that emphasizes the poor dialog. I gave up after one chapter and went back to reading Dune Messiah for the 5th time instead. I may try again later, but as with the Jack Widow series, I think it's over for me. I feel I should ask for my money back... It's that disappointing. EDIT: The return window on books is really short, so I am stuck with this awful novel. Sigh ...\n\n"", '\n\n  Will the REAL Reacher PLEASE stand up!!!!  I have read all the Reacher novels( i thought it very odd in the very first-Killing Floor,  when Joe is killed  then resurrected in many more stories?!)  This lacks the grit  with the shock and awe of before. A very predictable recipe writing formula, which leaves nothing to the imagination. Having read the reviews of his brothers books(BAD) methinks he is behind the quill! All the originality is gone , so as Reacher disappears over the horizon once more this reader bids him adieu not au revoir!!?\n\n', ""\n\n  Even with I am sure the best of intentions, his brother can't write Reacher. Storyline is nonsense, transitions move too quickly, no character development. The first person thing just does not work. Last one I will ever buy unless Lee Childs starts writing them again.\n\n""]"

  A TikTok sensation, this rom-com about a young woman who agrees to fake date a colleague and bring him to her sister’s wedding has “everything you could want in a romance” (Helen Hoang, New York Times bestselling author).Catalina Martín desperately needs a date to her sister’s wedding. Especially since her little white lie about her American boyfriend has spiralled out of control. Now everyone she knows—including her ex and his fiancée—will be there and eager to meet him. She only has four weeks to find someone willing to cross the Atlantic and aid in her deception. New York to Spain is no short flight and her raucous family won’t be easy to fool. Enter Aaron Blackford—her tall, handsome, condescending colleague—who surprisingly offers to step in. She’d rather refuse; never has there been a more aggravating, blood-boiling, and insufferable man. But Catalina is desperate, and as the wedding draws nearer, Aaron looks like her best option. And she begins to realize he might not be as terrible in the real world as he is at the office.

I'd had a rough week and needed a happy read. THIS WAS IT.It's like the grumpy-sunshine, enemies to lovers, forced proximity rom com that everyone needs in their lives.While this book may be a slow burn, the tension is electric, their connection (while oblivious to Lina) is obvious throughout, and when they FINALLY get to it.. they are EXPLOSIVE and HOT and it is steamy. But even reading their tension is steam inducing.It gave off BIG Fat Greek Wedding vibes, crossed with The Wedding Date and a sprinkling of Jim and Pam of the office.There is SO much to unpack in this book, in SUCH a good way. I truthfully thought that her family looked down on her because of her past experience dating her professor and her unsuccessful dating history since then. But it wasn't until her father lovingly called her an earthquake that I realized their concern was based out of love and wanting to see her happy .Then there is Lina's past history with her professor and the rumors that swirled around her and plagued her and made her feel so much less than she was. And the professor gave zero sh*ts about her feelings.The paralell (spoiler!!) That happens with thus scenario at the end of the book is just *chefs kiss!*And do NOT even get me started on Gerald. He infuriated me so much that when my husband interrupted me mid-read I actually snapped at him. I had to take a moment to realize that I was mad at Gerald and not my actual life.Aaron and Lina were just this great modern couple tackling such REAL life issues. Aaron is the kind of man that men should aspire to be!

OU AND THE TENSION. TOP.TIER. the characters especially Lina felt realistic with there struggles and not push to force drama. Also the family in the book was 😘, the blatant love between everyone was perfect I could feel it through the book.

There has only been a few books that have fulfilled my expectations and “The Spanish Love Deception” is now added to this list.This story made me cringe, laugh out loud, giggle, and made my heart ache and rejoice throughout the story.The two main characters (Catalina and Aaron) were so much fun to read about that I could totally imagine this book as a movie.I want to read it again to savor the characters and cheer them on.Thanks to the author, Elena Armas, for bringing to life to heartwarming story of Catalina and Aaron.  It was Perfection!\n\n', '\n\n  This was a great fake dating, office enemies to lovers romance. I thought that Lina was hilarious. The book had me laughing from the first few pages. I love the witty banter between Aaron and Lina. I found the book to be somewhat of a slow burn. The author really makes you wait for the couple to get together. Overall this was a really good book. I would recommend it to those who enjoy romantic comedies.The best part of the book was every time Aaron would call Lina ""baby""...swoon.\n\n', '\n\n  Okay wow! Lina & Aaron!! I’m obsessed, and this book was incredible. This is an enemies-to-lovers, fake-dating romance and my gosh, it’s perfect. This is a slow burn and it’s SO worth it.

She desperately needs a date for her sisters wedding back in Spain where all her family is. In walks the 6’4 blue-eyed pain in her ass co-worker, Aaron Blackford. He inserts himself as her only option. But he’s the bane of her existence. This can’t go right, can it?Please run to read this. It’s SO good! PLUS, the author just announced she is working on a second book for one of the side characters, Lina’s best friend, Rosie! Give me all the steamy-romancy-bickering-love. I’m hooked.\n\n', '\n\n  I was looking for a slow burn contemporary multi-cultural romance and wow, did this book deliver!The slow evolution of the relationship burned so hot!  The characters are lovely and the mix of American and Spanish brings an interesting flavor to the story.  It’s also funny.I highly recommend it.  Expect to not be able to put it down once you start.  It’s that good.\n\n', ""\n\n  I was super excited to read this book because of all the great reviews, but I was quickly disappointed within the first five pages. It takes four pages for the main character to just simply turn around and I can't think of any point in the novel where I was actually enjoying it. If this hadn't been the book my book club selected, I probably would have stopped reading long ago. Plot is similar to Hating Game, but carries none of the enjoyable qualities. The main character, Catalina, has long drawn out thoughts that cover pages and simple conversations take forever to be finished. There are a lot of plot holes or points that never get brought up again. Way too many cliches that doesn't really work in the favour of the book or its characters. Honestly, this book could have been condensed into 200-300 pages instead of the 400 something that it is. The 'problem' in the novel isn't focused on enough to even feel sympathy towards the MC, and only adds to the annoyance of the reader. Really tried my all to enjoy it but can't say i did at all.\n\n""]"

  My plan was as simple as they come… in theory. Show up at the Cerberus clubhouse and give dear old Dad a piece of my mind. What I didn’t expect was being welcomed by the open arms of a father who had no idea I existed.More importantly, I didn’t anticipate HER. Delilah Donovan was a breath of fresh air. She would soon become my reason for wanting to become a better man, my reason for getting out of bed with a smile on my normally sneering face. But no matter how much I changed, she’d always be too good for a man like me.It was over before it could even begin.

  From the bestselling author of The Bomber Mafia, learn what sets high achievers apart—from Bill Gates to the Beatles—in this seminal work from ""a singular talent"" (New York Times Book Review). In this stunning book, Malcolm Gladwell takes us on an intellectual journey through the world of ""outliers""—the best and the brightest, the most famous and the most successful. He asks the question: what makes high-achievers different?His answer is that we pay too much attention to what successful people are like, and too little attention to where they are from: that is, their culture, their family, their generation, and the idiosyncratic experiences of their upbringing. Along the way he explains the secrets of software billionaires, what it takes to be a great soccer player, why Asians are good at math, and what made the Beatles the greatest rock band.Brilliant and entertaining, Outliers is a landmark work that will simultaneously delight and illuminate.

It felt like the author was showing off, making something for 'general reading' when really it is a statistical report on how to make better policies.

For me it was more of a wake-up call to be wary of the opportunities you yourself may be given and be willing to take those opportunities, work hard, and one day be able to do something great for the world. Maybe this is because I feel that I am in the sort of position these people once were with respect to my current career path but I think the main point is just to gain awareness of the obstacles some of us may have to overcome, whether its surrounding ourselves with better people or searching for opportunities in a field that is important to us. Some things we can change and some we can't, so we might as well work with what we can change and control.\n\n"", '\n\n  A masterful analysis of the critical factors which determine individual success in almost any field or endeavor. Gladwell as usual poses the conventional wisdom and then proceeds to tear it to shreds in example after example of how famous people have obtained success. He boils the potential for success down to two temporal factors: when a person is born in relation to major social or technological changes and how much time it takes to become very proficient at something. While native intelligence is important, it is not the critical factor in determining the potential for success. Over and over, Gladwell provides examples which show that luck, being at the right place at the right time and spending an inordinate amount of time perfecting a task are the determinants of success.\n\n']"

It summarizes much of the material presented in his live seminars that draw 2,000+ people several times a year, and updates much of the research. What sets Brendon apart from other personal development gurus is the thoroughness of his research and the practicality of his action items. You aren\'t asked to speak to your inner child or manifest grace into your life; the items are as tactical as programming your phone or adding supplements to your wellness regime. But these tactics are all part of an overall strategy to help you achieve your goals in multiple arenas. But be forewarned - there is a LOT of useful information here. It\'s easy to get overloaded. My suggestion is to start with the tips that seem like ""quick wins,"" gain a little positive momentum, and then gradually add some of the bigger transformational actions.

  This “gripping” New York Times bestseller from the host of CNN podcast Behind the Desk tells the true story—and backstage drama—of late-night comedy (Los Angeles Times).   When beloved host Johnny Carson announced his retirement after thirty years on The Tonight Show, millions of Americans mourned. But inside the television industry, the news ignited a battle between two amazing talents—Jay Leno and David Letterman—who both yearned to occupy the departing legend’s chair. For NBC, it would be a decision with millions of dollars at stake. Soon these two comedians with strikingly different styles, who had once shared a friendship as they worked the clubs together, would be engaged in a fierce competition for the prize.   Based on in-depth reporting and interviews with those involved, and updated with a new introduction by the author—a producer of CNN series The Story of Late Night—The Late Shift is a “vivid, behind-the-scenes, blow-by-blow account” of the fight that ensued, as stars, agents, and executives maneuvered for control of the most profitable program in TV history (Chicago Tribune).   “Remarkably gripping . . . Takes us deep into the bizarre high-stakes world of broadcasting . . . A powerful story, and ultimately a sad one, filled with casualties as well as winners.” —The New York Times Book Review   “Solid reporting, based on extensive interviews with the principals, lifts The Late Shift into a class of its own. . . . The insights into the people involved are what make [the book] a page-turner.” —Orange Country Register  Read more  ","['4.0 out of 5 stars', '3.0 out of 5 stars', '5.0 out of 5 stars', '5.0 out of 5 stars', '5.0 out of 5 stars', '5.0 out of 5 stars']","['\nPretty anti-Leno, but..\n', '\nThought I was getting an authentic hardcover but was a ...\n', '\nThe Battle For Late Night\n', '\nGreat Book\n', '\nFive Stars\n', '\nFive Stars\n']","[""\n\n  Of the 2, I'm a Leno guy more than a Letterman guy, and the book is very anti-Leno.

I know that's unfair but I can't help it, I'm obsessed. I read an interview with the author in which she said that she wrote this book in a month while waiting for her first book series (Throne of Glass) to be published.

You don't learn too much about him which makes the mystery of him so appealing.There are many secondary characters that were very intriguing and added to the whole of the story beautifully. We meet Lucien, Ianthe, and Rhysand who I'm pretty sure is going to play a much bigger role in this series than I had realized at the beginning.This book has all the elements of a great series. The writing is flawless and the story flows quite seamlessly.I'm already into the second book and can't wait to see what the author has in store.\n\n"", '\n\n  I\'d give it a 2 1/2.

  “The reigning queen of historical fiction” --  Fiona Davis, New York Times bestselling author of The Lions of Fifth Avenue  The New York Times and USA  Today bestselling author of The Huntress and The Alice Network returns  with another heart-stopping World War II story of three female code breakers  at Bletchley Park and the spy they must root out after the war is over.1940. As England prepares to fight the Nazis, three very different women answer the call to mysterious country estate Bletchley Park, where the best minds in Britain train to break German military codes. Vivacious debutante Osla is the girl who has everything—beauty, wealth, and the dashing Prince Philip of Greece sending her roses—but she burns to prove herself as more than a society girl, and puts her fluent German to use as a translator of decoded enemy secrets. Imperious self-made Mab, product of east-end London poverty, works the legendary codebreaking machines as she conceals old wounds and looks for a socially advantageous husband. Both Osla and Mab are quick to see the potential in local village spinster Beth, whose shyness conceals a brilliant facility with puzzles, and soon Beth spreads her wings as one of the Park’s few female cryptanalysts. But war, loss, and the impossible pressure of secrecy will tear the three apart.  1947. As the royal wedding of Princess Elizabeth and Prince Philip whips post-war Britain into a fever, three friends-turned-enemies are reunited by a mysterious encrypted letter--the key to which lies buried in the long-ago betrayal that destroyed their friendship and left one of them confined to an asylum. A mysterious traitor has emerged from the shadows of their Bletchley Park past, and now Osla, Mab, and Beth must resurrect their old alliance and crack one last code together. But each petal they remove from the rose code brings danger--and their true enemy--closer...

This author writes so well. I truly was engrossed. I get swept away. This book is over 600 pages so you get a great reading experience for the price.

Employees at Bletchley Park deciphered encrypted Nazi communications, providing vital information to the Allies.""\n\n', ""\n\n  This story was so well done, so intriguing, so consuming that I couldn’t put it down. It was by no means a quick read, but it was epic and heartfelt. It is a remarkable work of historical fiction and will be one of my top picks for 2021, if not of all time. I am traditionally a fan of heroic WWII sagas, but I enjoyed that this didn’t put us on the frontlines or in the shoes of those living through an invasion, but brought us behind the scenes, so to speak, and into the heart of valiant warriors in their own right. I found it to be an absolutely fascinating masterpiece that brought me to laughter, tears, and frustration. It will be worth a re-read one day, and in all honestly, I’m having a difficult time leaving Bletchley Park behind.For transparency, I started listening via a gifted audiobook from HarperAudio via NetGalley.  I decided that format wasn't for me and purchased a print version and digital copy.\n\n"", ""\n\n  5 star read.  I love Kate Quinn's books and this is one of my favourites so far.  Quinn takes us to England in 1940.  Three different women are selected to work at what they discover to be Bletchley Park as codebreakers.  Wealthy deb Osla (dating Prince Philip no less), Mab-a girl from the rough part of town, and Beth-a girl demeaned by her overbearing mother who believes she is stupid.  The girls all find their niche at Bletchley.  While they work on breaking the impossible Enigma machine codes, there is a spy in their midst.  This book was so well written, the characters so well developed and the storyline clipped along, I enjoyed the read so much.  I hated to see the end of the book as I felt like I was saying goodbye to friends I had enjoyed getting to know.  Quinn just keeps on getting better with every book.  A great read.\n\n"", ""\n\n  Yeah wow!  I expected this tale to be as genuine and gripping as Quinn's previous novels, but was disappointed. She developed her characters well (some patterned after real historic people) and captured life at Bletchley Park well (which is incredibly well documented from many sources). But the execution was lacking, the drive to excitement lacking, and most of all the conclusion was unlinked from the prior storyline; could all of those people have magically come together - evading local police, MI-5, sanitarium personnel, other folks who had sworn an oath of secrecy - to resolve the conflict which one main character found herself embroiled in???\n\n"", ""\n\n  Great book.  Second best for Kate after The Alice Network.  I loved it.  Listen to the Betchley Park podcasts (UK) if you want the actual history behind it.  This is such an exciting and important time in the history of women's contribution to WWII effort.  It is AMAZING what young women did during the war.  Feminism didn't start in the 1970s.  It started here.  Kate Quinn never fails to bring history to you.  It must have been such an incredible experience to have done what they did.  There are so many stories of women's contributions.  Quinn's books transport you and you become so engrossed in the story.  She is a very compelling writer.\n\n"", '\n\n  This is one of the best books I have read in years.  Utterly amazing.  The characters were well written - easy to ""see"" and ""hear.""  The story line is fascinating.  There were many times within the book that my heart was racing in anticipation as I tore through a particular section to see how it would turn out.\n\n', ""\n\n  The Rose Code is of the best books I've read in a long time. I've read The Alice Network and The Huntress, as well, and loved both, but I think this is my favourite Kate Quinn novel. Initially, I was slow to progress through the book because I spent a long time trying to understand code-breaking and how it worked. Once I put aside trying to fully comprehend the codebreaking process, I was able to better enjoy the book, its characters and the history. I really enjoyed how Kate Quinn weaved many real people into the novel with her fictional characters. I think this book will stick with me for a long time.\n\n""]"

  A ""sublimely creepy"" psychological thriller from #1 New York Times bestselling author Colleen Hoover (Tarryn Fisher, New York Times bestselling author).Lowen Ashleigh is a struggling writer on the brink of financial ruin when she accepts the job offer of a lifetime. Jeremy Crawford, husband of bestselling author Verity Crawford, has hired Lowen to complete the remaining books in a successful series his injured wife is unable to finish. Lowen arrives at the Crawford home, ready to sort through years of Verity’s notes and outlines, hoping to find enough material to get her started. What Lowen doesn’t expect to uncover in the chaotic office is an unfinished autobiography Verity never intended for anyone to read. Page after page of bone-chilling admissions, including Verity's recollection of the night her family was forever altered. Lowen decides to keep the manuscript hidden from Jeremy, knowing its contents could devastate the already grieving father. But as Lowen’s feelings for Jeremy begin to intensify, she recognizes all the ways she could benefit if he were to read his wife’s words. After all, no matter how devoted Jeremy is to his injured wife, a truth this horrifying would make it impossible for him to continue loving her.

INDEED!\n', '\nMind blown  KABOOOOOM\n']","['\n\n  I ended 2018 with a book I found very unpleasant and irritating. My apologies to those who loved this novel, but it just wasn’t for me. I usually enjoy domestic psychological thrillers, but need to have one likeable character with which to empathize. I found all three main characters despicable.  An attempt here to combine erotica with a  thriller detracted from any buildup of mystery and suspense for me. The many sex scenes were quite explicit, and perhaps I am becoming prudish, but I wanted more a more creepy factor. This certainly existed but kept being pushed into the background by both women’s lust for Jeremy. There was a good plot somewhere here, but sad to say I felt all these hateful people deserved one another. The ending seemed forced and implausible.\n\n', '\n\n  I’ve read quite a few of Colleen Hoover’s novels and been impressed by how emotionally intense her love stories are. So when I saw she wrote her first suspense thriller, I knew I was in for a quite a ride.The novel follows Lowen Asleigh, a struggling author, who’s in a dire financial state. She’s gotten an eviction notice for her apartment and doesn’t have a new manuscript to sell to publishers, having spend most of her time caring for her terminally ill mother. Then she gets an offer of a lifetime. Bestselling Verity Crawford has gotten badly injured in car accident and her husband, Jeremy Crawford, wants Lowen to finish her popular novel series. Desperate to keep a roof over her head, Lowen accepts. She comes over to the Crawford’s secluded house in Virginia to go through Verity’s notes and outlines for future novels. Instead, she stumbles upon Verity’s unfinished autobiography detailing disturbing thoughts and chilling admissions, including a confession of what really happened the day Verity and Jeremy’s daughter died. Should Lowen show the autobiography to Jeremy, who’s a devoted to his injured wife and oblivious to her true character? Or keep it to herself and not devastate an already grieving father and husband?I honestly didn’t know much more than that going into this novel and I feel like that really is the best way of experiencing it. Go into this blind and the reveals and admissions will horrify you.There were parts that difficult for me to read, that left me feeling sick to my stomach. And yet, I couldn’t stop reading out of morbid curiosity. I needed to know what will happen next. How will it end? And yes, the ending shocked me more than the whole book. It left me second guessing everything I thought knew leading up to it. And yet, it fits so well!My opinions on the characters changed from like to hate and hate to like by the time the novel ended. I won’t say who I liked and disliked for that will spoil it (and I will want readers going into this blind!). But I will say this, there are two points of views in this novel, Lowen’s and Verity’s, and they’re very distinct from each other. The pacing didn’t drag or feel rushed, it felt even, just perfect.Do yourself a favour and don’t read this at night like I did. I really regretted it because I was freaking out and unable to sleep. This story is definitely going to haunt me.\n\n', ""\n\n  This is a good vs evil relationship dynamic, set inside the very intimate quarters of marriage turned family. It only gets worse when the most innocent are forced to pay the highest price of all. Heartbreaking! Author Colleen Hoover, unleashes the most terrifying & unfit of character's. Meet Verity, trusted wife, mother and best-selling author, aka selfish, sex-crazed, obsessive, control-freak psychopath. A woman devoid of conscience who runs roughshod over her sweet children and partner, by giving them no voice. Wouldn't ya know it? Evil Verity marries Jeremy, a golden Saint of a man, who any woman would deem herself the luckiest woman alive, to call him husband.  He is the loving personification of husband, father, citizen - a true family man, tasked with the role of  chief bottle-washer and nurturer, but not in a weak way. ENTER Lowen - the reluctant heroin of the story. She is hired by Jeremy to finish writing some books for Verity, after a car accident. A final twist is thrown into the plot at the end of the book, presenting us with a startling new revelation which gives us pause, with much left to think about. This book is not without its weaknesses, but overall, I recommend this absorbing novel.\n\n"", '\n\n  I hate Verity Crawford.This book had me on the edge of my seat from the first sentence. I have read some pretty dark reads and loved every word of them but this dark book was even more twisted. I couldn\'t put it down, except of course when real life called.  The detail of characters is very intriguing and I knew from the moment that Verity ""looks"" through the window at Lowen that she saw her.The story in the story always fascinates me because technically you get two great reads in one and this is no exception. The twists & turns draw you in and honestly the manuscript whether was supposed to be what actually happened and the note discovered after was to cover it up or not just left me with my mouth hanging open.  I honestly feel that the 5 star rating system need to change because 5 stars just seems like a low score for such an amazing book.Thanks for the ability to read this Ms. Hoover, it\'s amazing.\n\n']"

That’s exactly what you can count on throughout The Day I Met Jesus. The authors transport you into the first century latched onto stories of five broken women and their encounter with the Lord of healing, redemption. and grace.Your journey takes off with biblical narratives written as diary entries from an adulteress caught in the act, prostitute who loved extravagantly, multiple divorcée currently living in sin, defiled, isolated patient with an incessant flow of blood, and a friend who was one of Jesus’s much-loved disciples.Each one masterfully prepares the scene where we get to live in their skin; see things though their eyes, feel what they felt. Their first-person account brings you to a better understanding of who they were and what their lives must have been like. Each word pointing to that moment in time that changed everything, setting the stage for us to eavesdrop on their transforming encounter with Jesus. Words that paint, in living colour, what it means to be loved, forgiven, restored, healed. As we slip into their shoes, we detect footprints of someone we know much like them and catch glimpses of ourselves. Their stories, though experienced long ago, contain a timeless universality that seamlessly joins past events to present relevance.As I came to know those women from their perspective, I was eager to overlay their memoirs onto the Sacred Text that immediately follows. Comparing their reflections with the Gospel made what took place more real, vivid and meaningful. Even more so with the Walking it Out section that concludes the chapter. That’s where it’s our turn to meet Jesus. Where the authors zoom in on more insights and finer details of the culture, lifestyle and beliefs at the time of Christ. They also put together the Talking it Over questions at back of the book to help us interact with the biblical narrative on our own or in a group setting,The Day I Met Jesus reveals how there is so much than what meets the eye. Things I never thought of before. Like how was it the accusers just happened to catch that woman in adultery? That Mary of Bethany who brazenly sat at Jesus’s feet, boldly poured expensive perfume over His feet, quietly held back defending herself against disapproval. It was a real eye-opener when the authors pointed out the unlikelihood the Samaritan woman, marred with a stained reputation, would be taken seriously when she returned to her village telling people about her exchange with Jesus. Yet, they followed her back to see for themselves and were subsequently converted. Clearly, they noticed something different about her.I loved the way this book captures how the Jesus who touched the lives of those women wants to do the same for you and me. Forgiveness, grace, acceptance and boundless love are ours. Today. Here and now. Sins, mistakes, hurts washed away to make room for life redeemed and free. Shame is wiped away and new life springs forth. Once we  meet Jesus, our lives will never be the same again. Just like the five women.I met Jesus in a new and powerful way through this book. I think you will too.Disclosure – Many thanks to BakerBooks for the complimentary copy of the book in exchange for this unbiased review.\n\n', '\n\n  This book beautifully writes 5 perspectives of women in the gospels. This book brings alive the testimonies and lives of women who Jesus ministered to. I enjoyed how the authors gave a cultural understanding of the background of these women with a most likely story of what they would have been going through and thinking. It helped me to understand these women in a deeper level and a greater understanding of the power of the love of Jesus.This book has been provided courtesy of Graf-Martin Communications and Baker Publishing Group. :)\n\n']"

Making it a priority would have been easier had he not arrived at his family’s annual Christmas party looking ridiculously handsome in a suit.Then he kissed me.

  #1 NEW YORK TIMES BESTSELLER • A special 20th anniversary edition of the beloved book that changed millions of lives—with a new afterword by the authorMaybe it was a grandparent, or a teacher, or a colleague. Someone older, patient and wise, who understood you when you were young and searching, helped you see the world as a more profound place, gave you sound advice to help you make your way through it.For Mitch Albom, that person was Morrie Schwartz, his college professor from nearly twenty years ago.Maybe, like Mitch, you lost track of this mentor as you made your way, and the insights faded, and the world seemed colder. Wouldn't you like to see that person again, ask the bigger questions that still haunt you, receive wisdom for your busy life today the way you once did when you were younger?Mitch Albom had that second chance. He rediscovered Morrie in the last months of the older man's life. Knowing he was dying, Morrie visited with Mitch in his study every Tuesday, just as they used to back in college. Their rekindled relationship turned into one final “class”: lessons in how to live.Tuesdays with Morrie is a magical chronicle of their time together, through which Mitch shares Morrie's lasting gift with the world.

I do remember, however, that I went sleepless; so totally engaged was I in this story of a rekindled friendship between teacher and student.  I also recall that almost immediately upon finishing it, orders were placed for copies to be sent to a number of family and friends.  I rave about this book constantly and have again, this Christmas, gifted more folks with this wonderful, inspiring story.I have done reviews on other Albom-authored works (I have the complete library!) and with only one exception that I can think of, have rated them as five-star must reads.  A remarkable author. A gifted story-teller.  Tuesdays With Morrie  will touch your very soul.\n\n"", '\n\n  A kind reminder of what life is all about. Things we normally forget or take for granted because of our crazy busy lives, as well as our greedy and unforgiven culture. Morrie was a guy who used to walk the talk and had this last opportunity to share his thoughts with the rest of the world through Mitch Albom.Morrie left a legacy for us. Not a business empire or an invention that changed the world. Just a few (well, many) words of wisdom from a down to earth man who lived like a gentlemen and made a positive contribution to society while passing through this planet. We all should leave something good behind, so humanity can evolve in the right direction.\n\n', '\n\n  This is the story of a young man who had been very close with his professor at university, and, although he promised to stay in touch after graduation, he hadn\'t.  Then one night he was channel-hopping, and caught his ""coach"" on Nightline with Ted Koppel.  Morrie Schwartz, a sociology professor at Brandeis University in Waltham, Massachusetts, was talking about how he was coping with ALS.  He told Ted and his audience,. . . when all this started, I asked myself, \'Am I going to withdraw from the world, like most people do, or am I going to live.\'  I decided I\'m going to live — or at least try to live — the way I want, with dignity, with courage, with humor, with composure.And that\'s what he did!  This man who had inspired so many students, had loved music, and loved to dance was slowly losing his muscle control.  First, was the need for a cane.  Shortly after he was diagnosed, Morrie entered his classroom of 30 years, slowly making his way to the front with his cane, and sat down to tell his students there was a risk in taking his class this term — he might die before it was over.  When he attended the funeral of a colleague, using a wheelchair by now, he thought, ""What a waste, all those people saying all those wonderful things, and Irv never got to hear any of it.""  So Morrie gathered some friends and family together one Sunday afternoon for what he called ""a living funeral.""  They laughed, they cried, told stories, and paid tribute, and it was ""a rousing success.""Mitch made a phone call after watching the Koppel show, and went to pay his ""coach"" a visit.  It was the beginning of what became known to both Mitch and Morrie, as his final course — how one faces death — with a class of one!  Mitch retells the story interspersed with flashbacks to memories (chapters in italics) from his childhood, teen years, university life with Morrie, and his post-graduation life until the memories merge with the times he spent on Tuesdays as he watched his coach become more and more dependent, less able to stand the pain, and unable to so much as move his own head an inch or two.  Mitch\'s own life had become one of fevered pace, usually doing 5 things at once, jetting around to cover sports events, writing for newspaper, magazines, and doing television; he knew he was no longer the same student Morrie remembered.  But, the affection was still there, and a new chapter began.Despite his approaching death, it seemed to Mitch that Morrie was clear about everything in life that was important, and what was not.  Morrie always said Mitch could ask anything, so after his third Tuesday visit, Mitch made a list of things he wanted to get clear about, certain that Morrie would be able to help him find that clarity.  He wrote, ""Death, Fear,  Aging,  Greed,  Marriage,  Family,  Society,  Forgiveness,  A meaningful life.""  They discussed all this — and religion, and afterlife, being with someone ""in the present,"" and, how to say goodbye.  It was an opportunity for Mitch to re-examine his life — choices he made, dreams he bartered away for things.  It was a way to say goodbye.This edition marks the 10th anniversary of the first publishing and contains an afterward from Mitch.  It has been printed in ""dozens of countries . . . and translated into many languages,"" made into a movie and performed as a stage play; it has become curriculum in many colleges and universities, and can be found in ""funeral homes, hospices, churches, [and] synagogues.""  It is full of wonderful, gentle wisdom — not just for dying, or coping with the death of a loved one, but for living, and for living fully.  There are many more things I could tell you about this book, but the main thing is that reading it will inspire you, and bless you.  It will enable you to live well.\n\n', '\n\n  I was tearing on the last few chapters with thoughts of my grandparents and how I should have spent more time with them. I am lucky to still have my parents and will be sure to spend more time with them, my siblings and of course my wife and kids: those that matter most to me.Please do the same with your loved ones!\n\n', ""\n\n  One of the most deeply moving books I have read. Infact, I have read it numerous times. To my mother, my dear friend who is legally blind,have given it as gifts to friends. I have seen the DVD, and watched a live theatrical performance. Need I say more. Mitch Album's  wonderful narrative make for an easy yet touching read.If this book doesn't touch you deeply......I don't know what will.P.S . This book will be more appealing to mature readers. Young readers (like my teenage son) may not really appreciate some of 'Life's Lessons'  discussed in the novel since they are yet to experience the multiple facets of life.\n\n"", ""\n\n  An absolutely fabulously written eye opener for any/all to read, especially today. It's amazing/refreshing how the people we meet daily can bear such significance to the real meaning of life's most precious gift- LOVE. That's why I'm happy to have taken the time to stop and enjoy this book. Live funerals should be a way of life, which is too short....no sense in mourning the could-have should-have-said-moments, when the decedent can't hear one's kindness and love. My Mom recommended this book to me and I must pass it on to others. Great work, Mitch Albom, when it's genuine and you weren't even trying to impress so many readers with your unique and absolutely refreshing style. Keep it real always!\n\n""]"

The heartbreak and emotion in this book felt so real. Geraldine Grus is such an amazing character. She is so real and unapologetically herself.\n\n', '\n\n  What a roller coaster of a ride! This book hits you right in the gut and leaves you winded hours after you’ve finished reading! Be prepared for the massive cliffhanger at the end!

   Ryder, Garrett, Kenzo, and Diesel—The Vipers. They run this town and everyone in it. Their deals are as sordid as their business, and their reputation is enough to bring a grown man to his knees, forcing him to beg for mercy. They are not people you mess with, yet my dad did. The old man ran up a debt with them and then sold me to cover his losses.Yes, sold me. They own me now. I’m theirs in every sense of the word. But I’ve never been meek and compliant. These men, they look at me with longing. Their scarred, blood-stained hands holding me tight. They want everything I am, everything I have to give, and won’t stop until they get just that. They can own my body, but they will never have my heart.The Vipers? I’m going to make them regret the day they took me. This girl? She bites too. *18+ Reverse Harem Romance.

I am all for reverse harems and dark erotic novels but this one was over the top. Characters weren’t believable and I was not at all invested in the storyline- all smut no heart. Gave up halfway through.\n\n', '\n\n  I picked up this book because it blew up on TikTok. I really didn’t know much going in other than some video reviews I saw - some positive, some negative.This book is basically just sex, blood and gore. It’s reverse harem meaning one woman and multiple men (4 in this case). There’s really not much plot to the book other than a woman being sold by her father to pay a debt (not a spoiler, it’s in the book description).The book isn’t poorly written but it’s very repetitive and there doesn’t seem to be much substance. If you have a sensitive stomach or don’t handle violence/abuse/assault and very graphic sex scenes, then I would say this book isn’t for you.I just wish there was more to this book. It starts out promising with the female lead acting really tough but she seems to deflate very quickly. Yes, she’s strong and gets her own way but her personality and “quirks” become flat and she just seems to fade into the personality of the men.There’s no redemption, which is fine I like a grey book, but some of the aspects for the characters seem thrown in to make the characters more likeable? It doesn’t seem to jive with the rest of their personalities.Basically this book is just sex scenes, constantly. I don’t think it adds to the book. I scrolled through some because it was just the same stuff over again, and I didn’t miss anything by doing that.\n\n', ""\n\n  I absolutely loved this book!! Its dark, gritty, funny & addictive!! I read it in 24 hours because I couldn't put it down!! You definitely need to be in the mood for it but once you are you won't regret it!! New author for me and excited to read more from her♡\n\n"", '\n\n  Full disclosure, I did not read the description when purchasing and had it confused with another title. There is no plot. The writing is not great, the characters are flat and unbelievable. Oh, and THERE IS NO PLOT. The barest semblance of the story that is pretending to be a plot only serves to link the smut scenes which were not to my particular taste and became increasing graphic and disturbing as they went along. I think I made it half way before I have up. Would have given this zero stars if I could have.\n\n', ""\n\n  First time I've ever left a review for a book and only the 2nd book in my life I could not finish. I like smut in books, but this was just awful. Zero story line at all. Characters have zero personality. Author just relies on sex, rape, swearing, etc and thinks it'll make a good story. I honestly wish I could get my money back.\n\n"", '\n\n  I don’t even know where to begin. I decided to read this book because I was in a reading slump and thought this would be a quick read. But my goodness the writing is terrible! Such cringe scenes, the guys in the book went from I will kill you to he “giggles” like wtf…The plot makes zero sense and it’s so repetitive. Not to mention the girl’s character goes from I HATE EVERYONE to complete desperation for sleeping with all 4 guys.The book seems like it’s written from a male perspective where the woman is thin yet curvy big boobs, tiny waist, and yet a hug ass.. and the smut is just cringe more than hot.Anyways, to sum it up, it definitely got me out of my reading slump as now I can go back to actual good written books with a plot. But don’t bother reading this. I did not finish this book. Would give this a zero if I could.\n\n', '\n\n  In my opinion, I didn’t really enjoy this book. The plot was missing, there was too many spice scenes. At some point it got repetitive. I didn’t even finish the book but I don’t think I’ll wanna continue just because it’s getting boring and there is no action. If u don’t mind that then I would recommend this book but if you want there to be a rly nice plot then I don’t recommend getting this book. I will not lie I really like the characters. Overall, it’s a nice book but plot is missing and it gets boring at some points and it was too rushed in the beginning.\n\n', ""\n\n  I think with any books you will have some people who love certain plots and styles of writing and others who it just isn't their cup of tea.I personally loved this book and would love even more of this story like a few years in the future or with the next generation. I loved all the smut scenes and think it really pushed many boundaries I thought I had.\n\n""]"

The amount of character development, however, is insurmountably greater than in the first instance. Many characters that struggled to accept plot-relevant revelations finally realize that, in one of the best inner reflections in the series so far, ""death is lighter than a feather, and duty heavier than a mountain.""My favorite character from the first book appeared again, resurrecting from uncertain death, some new characters were introduced and one completely stole the scenes he was featured in. Reading Hurin and Rand\'s interactions always brought a smile to my face, and the progression of tone in their conversations served well to foretell heavier stakes in the story. Subtle, yet expertly done.The motivation behind Thom\'s decision to eventually follow Rand\'s journey was undoubtedly the most shocking moment in the entire book. I was not expecting the sudden loss and determination birthed from such a tragic event. While being intrinsically realistic, given the absurd setting and culture of the people from Cairhien, it was also heartbreaking to recognize that the wheel cares not for the plans of men. If in the first book characterization was good, in the second it gets even better. All major characters renew their determination, face difficulties that will mold their future interactions, and set in motion events that promise to change the life of everyone in the books to come.The world is further increased in size and complexity with all the lore, important regions visited, and new threats that appear from unknown lands. Just from reading the first two books, I can already tell that The Wheel of Time is among the best fiction world ever written, and I can not wait to see the plotlines and worldbuilding all come to fruition in the next instances of the series.The Great Hunt was an all-around improvement when compared with the previous entry, but it still suffers from the same slow buildup that only gets satisfyingly tight-paced towards the conclusion. That, in my opinion, is not completely a negative point, as all the worldbuilding and character development is fundamental if a gratifying completion is desired. However, the initial seventy percent of the story still distinctively feels like a huge setup and can get difficult to push through all shifts in point of view.\n\n', '\n\n  the best saga I have ever read and will ever read. I have read the wheel of time twice and am going for the third re-read because the final chapter is coming out. Honestly I have read other fantasy books but nothing comes even remotely close to Jordans world of intricate characters and sub plots. The wheel of Time has changed me and I can`t ever read anything else and be satisfied. I`ll read it till I die!!AMAZING AMAZING AMAZING!! nothing more.\n\n', '\n\n  The cornier of the book was damage.
