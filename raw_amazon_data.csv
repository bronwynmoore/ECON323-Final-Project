  ""Overachiever was hands down one of the best rom coms I have ever read. One word. Banter. It has that in spades and gets better as you read as if that's even possible!""  -- #1 New York Times Bestselling Author Rachel Van Dyken It started with a summer job and a ridiculous sex dream.   If you were to ask my friends to describe me, they’d tell you I’m an ambitious person. Responsible, driven, and focused on my goals. Words like stubborn and uptight would probably get thrown in there too. I’m not sure about that, but I know who I’m not.   I’m not the woman who lets a guy derail me from my plans. Watching others make that mistake has taught me well. No serious dating. No relationship until I’m successfully settled into my career. That’s the promise I made to myself and I’m determined to keep it.   Despite being an excellent student, there’s one lesson I fear I’ve learned too late. Funny men aren’t as harmless as they seem and should be avoided at all times. They sneak in under your radar and end up under your skirt. One second you’re laughing. The next you’re hunting for your underwear on a hotel room floor. Believe me, it’s not worth it.   If only my heart would stop screaming louder than my brain, I might be able to believe that Owen falls into that category. He’s my friend, but every day we spend together in this hotel, or working on our summer job building houses for charity, the harder it gets to convince myself we shouldn’t be more.    Years of diligence, and I’m being destroyed by a goofy smile.

  #1 on AMAZON, and a NEW YORK TIMES, WALL STREET JOURNAL, USA TODAY and PUBLISHERS WEEKLY NATIONAL BESTSELLERPharma-funded mainstream media has convinced millions of Americans that Dr. Anthony Fauci is a hero. He is anything but.   As director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), Dr. Anthony Fauci dispenses $6.1 billion in annual taxpayer-provided funding for scientific research, allowing him to dictate the subject, content, and outcome of scientific health research across the globe. Fauci uses the financial clout at his disposal to wield extraordinary influence over hospitals, universities, journals, and thousands of influential doctors and scientists—whose careers and institutions he has the power to ruin, advance, or reward.   During more than a year of painstaking and meticulous research, Robert F. Kennedy Jr. unearthed a shocking story that obliterates media spin on Dr. Fauci . . . and that will alarm every American—Democrat or Republican—who cares about democracy, our Constitution, and the future of our children’s health.  The Real Anthony Fauci reveals how “America’s Doctor” launched his career during the early AIDS crisis by partnering with pharmaceutical companies to sabotage safe and effective off-patent therapeutic treatments for AIDS. Fauci orchestrated fraudulent studies, and then pressured US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) regulators into approving a deadly chemotherapy treatment he had good reason to know was worthless against AIDS. Fauci repeatedly violated federal laws to allow his Pharma partners to use impoverished and dark-skinned children as lab rats in deadly experiments with toxic AIDS and cancer chemotherapies.   In early 2000, Fauci shook hands with Bill Gates in the library of Gates’ $147 million Seattle mansion, cementing a partnership that would aim to control an increasingly profitable $60 billion global vaccine enterprise with unlimited growth potential. Through funding leverage and carefully cultivated personal relationships with heads of state and leading media and social media institutions, the Pharma-Fauci-Gates alliance exercises dominion over global health policy.  The Real Anthony Fauci details how Fauci, Gates, and their cohorts use their control of media outlets, scientific journals, key government and quasi-governmental agencies, global intelligence agencies, and influential scientists and physicians to flood the public with fearful propaganda about COVID-19 virulence and pathogenesis, and to muzzle debate and ruthlessly censor dissent.     Read more  ","['5.0 out of 5 stars', '5.0 out of 5 stars', '5.0 out of 5 stars', '5.0 out of 5 stars', '5.0 out of 5 stars', '5.0 out of 5 stars', '5.0 out of 5 stars', '1.0 out of 5 stars']","['\nFauci Earthquake\n', '\nExcellent Book - everyone should read..\n', '\nTruth\n', '\nHonest and trustworthy journalism\n', '\nGet this book by any means necessary\n', '\nMeaning is found in context!\n', '\nNo matter your current covid opinions, read this book\n', '\nLies.

I love Melanie Harlow and I love every single person she writes!!Is it too cheesy to say this book is fiery? Steamy? Hot? I mean it all anyway!! Times a million! Call the fire department!If you like:- single dads- grumpy x sunshine- age gap romances- former military- next door neighboursThen this book is DEFINITELY for you because this has all of that and Melanie Harlow comes out SWINGING.Winnie is so sweet and perfect and I love that we get to see Winnie all grown up! If you loved the Cloverleigh Farms book, this is SO FUN because we get so so much Cloverleigh Farm content and we get so many updates on so many people, I loved it. We also get a nice little Bellamy Creek connections and let me tell you I SCREAMED when I read that. OUT LOUD. I try to take notes about books to remember my favourite part and ""Bellamy Creek"" is all I wrote down because I loved that part SO MUCH and I was just absolutely blasting through the rest of the book. BACK TO THE POINT, Winnie is amazing and I love how much we get to learn about Winnie and her goals and her dreams and her past and ugh, any man who ever treated Winnie wrong (I\'m looking at you Merrick!), if I catch you in the STREETS. BEWARE.Dex is, holy. I don\'t even know where to start with Dex. My obsession with Dex is almost so much that I can\'t even talk about it. I LOVE single dads and ex military and grumpy and first responders so he just scratched every itch that I\'ve ever had.The steam here is in FULL SWING. This is not a little spicy, this is ON FIRE. The smoke alarm is blaring. I can hear the sirens. Like WOW.The plot is also really sweet, we get to see a lot of character development from both Dex and Winnie. And in a true Melanie Harlow fashion, we get a lot of extra side characters and I was so excited at the end to read who the next book was going to be about.This is such an easy five stars for me, I will be re-reading this again tonight (and maybe every night for the rest of time????)""You ignited a fire in me I couldn\'t put out. I couldn\'t control my feelings for you, and I\'m sone who likes to be in control all the time.""\n\n', '\n\n  Amazing story! Winnie is 22 and believes in forever love. Dex is older, divorced and has two daughters. He tries not to notice his beautiful neighbour but fails every time. Dex is protecting his heart and tries to keep Winnie in the friend zone. As his love for her grows, he gets braver at trusting in love. Sweet, sexy and pulls your heartstrings.\n\n', '\n\n  Want an easy to read romance that makes you want to turn the page and love the ending?  Melanie Harlow is your girl!  I’ve read every book and enjoyed every one of them. This one is no exception.  Great story!  I even love the little girl’s story she wrote. I hope it’s made into a children’s book, I think it would sell! Can’t wait for the next book!\n\n']"

  A riveting new read that will thrill you from #1 New York Times bestselling author Fern Michaels, perfect for fans of Nora Roberts, Rachel Caine, and J.D. Robb.   Ellie Bowman barely remembers the incident that put her into a coma. When she awoke, filled with unease, all she knew for certain was that her boyfriend, Rick, was missing. She knew she needed to get away from her old life and recover in safety. With the proceeds of a video game she helped develop, Ellie starts over in rural Missouri, working from her cottage and trusting no one except her friend and business partner.   Yet even in this quiet small town, it’s impossible to completely isolate herself. Especially when a curious eight-year-old boy, smitten with Ellie’s pup, stops by every day to talk to him over the fence. Little by little, Ellie is being drawn back into the world through the neighbors and community around her, realizing that everyone has their own fears and obstacles to contend with.     But when Ellie hears that Rick has resurfaced, her nightmares return, and with them, small snippets of memory. No one has heard from Rick since before the incident, so why is he back now? Ellie wants to move forward with her life, but first she must find the courage to look into her past, no matter what she finds there . . .     Read more  ","['2.0 out of 5 stars', '5.0 out of 5 stars', '5.0 out of 5 stars', '5.0 out of 5 stars']","['\nI was looking forward to a “gripping novel of suspense”\n', '\nFantastic book.\n', '\nSuspense at its best!\n', '\nExcellent read!\n']","['\n\n  I was looking forward to a “gripping novel of suspense” but I soon found out that this book was more like a cozy mystery that I never really got into.

This kept me reading, in hopes of finding out soon. Then Colleen and Jackson were introduced to the story with Mitchel, the husband/father. This was a domestic abuse situation that escalated quickly in the chapter.As I was reading, waiting for some information to why Ellie was almost a recluse, it began to appear that the main character was really Colleen, not Ellie as the book\'s summary suggests. There wasn’t enough in the story about Ellie and her memory loss and what happened with her boyfriend.In addition, I found it hard to believe too many details about the characters and setting. The small town as described was just a bit too idyllic... it was too much like ""Mayberry."" Mitchel\'s reform happened too quick for it to be realistic. Colleen’s new romance was too fast. Hector, as a teenager, wouldn’t have time to do the amount of work that he is given credit for.The plot came to an end pretty quick and was anticlimactic with many situations working out for the positive so easily.

  ""Kick bad mental habits and toughen yourself up.""—Inc.Master your mental strength—revolutionary new strategies that work for everyone from homemakers to soldiers and teachers to CEOs.Everyone knows that regular exercise and weight training lead to physical strength. But how do we strengthen ourselves mentally for the truly tough times? And what should we do when we face these challenges? Or as psychotherapist Amy Morin asks, what should we avoid when we encounter adversity? Through her years counseling others and her own experiences navigating personal loss, Morin realized it is often the habits we cannot break that are holding us back from true success and happiness. Indulging in self-pity, agonizing over things beyond our control, obsessing over past events, resenting the achievements of others, or expecting immediate positive results holds us back. This list of things mentally strong people don't do resonated so much with readers that when it was picked up by Forbes.com it received ten million views.Now, for the first time, Morin expands upon the thirteen things from her viral post and shares her tried-and-true practices for increasing mental strength. Morin writes with searing honesty, incorporating anecdotes from her work as a college psychology instructor and psychotherapist as well as personal stories about how she bolstered her own mental strength when tragedy threatened to consume her.Increasing your mental strength can change your entire attitude. It takes practice and hard work, but with Morin's specific tips, exercises, and troubleshooting advice, it is possible to not only fortify your mental muscle but also drastically improve the quality of your life.

In my opinion, I'm so glad I got the book. For anyone who wants to do better, live better, grow emotionally/mentally, be happier, find peace...whatever...this book reminds us all about what we logically know but don't always feel. Even better is that she points out that life isn't about perfection, it's about progression. We're human. We're flawed. Sometimes even when we know better we don't, because that's life. Life is about trying and persevering rather than perfection and succeeding all the time.The book is great because she shows examples of how some of the undermining habits stem from some of the best of intentions, how subtle those habits can be and how insidious they are in affecting our lives. Then, she gives the light and the dark of each habit showing options to actively improve as well as gives examples of warning signs for thoughts/behaviour that can undermine the very goals we're striving towards.She's not trivializing suffering or even minimizing individual struggle. What she is doing is showing that the suffering and the struggle cannot be controlled or avoided. It is as much a part of life as the joy and the success, and it happens to everyone. However, there are tools / habits that allow the processing of the experience to be beneficial and even empowering despite the experience being a challenge, a setback, a loss, etc..This isn't a 'think positive' and it's all good kind of book. This is a book about actively assessing our thoughts and determining whether the thoughts empower or disempower/benefit or undermine. Using real life examples and personal experience the author allows the reader to relate and see that they're not alone. This is a book about working on improving by actively participating in life experiences while assessing how we view and think about the experience with an awareness of the thought processes that can enhance the experience for good or for bad.At the end of the day, life is a matter of perspective. How we view our reality determines how we feel and how we react. For some, tragedy is a gift while for others tragedy is the end of the game. Get this book to gain resilience and insight. I'm getting additional copies as gifts to help those I love gain additional tools and insight that will empower them.\n\n"", '\n\n  I will strongly recommend this book to anyone and everyone who wants to gain some insight in to mental health.

But when he finds that Persephone can offer a little slice of the revenge he's spent years craving, it's all the excuse he needs to help her—for a price.

It\'s got so many spicy scenes and they\'re so juicy hahaAs per the photos I posted with this review and the only complaint I have, is that the publishing company missed these typos. Im fairly certain there\'s a 3rd one that I forgot to take a pic of, I\'m considering using a pen to try and correct the first one lol but no other complaints!It\'s different to read a Greek God\'s related story that isn\'t set in Ancient Greece and that isn\'t about the original Greek God\'s themselves, in this story the original God\'s have long since died and the ""people"" of Olympus have since been voted into the roles of said dead God\'s for a few generations.There\'s no talk of mortals, demi God\'s or of these newly elected people having any relation to the original God\'s. (Zeus, Hades, Aphrodite and so on are now just titles and positions that people are elected into and they take on that name of the God or Goddess once elected.)lol but that\'s ok because the Author did amazing with the premise of the God\'s, because realistically the story doesn\'t need those kind of Ancient details as this is a modern vision of Olympus, designed as a city and is still away and a part from the mortal realm and it works great!\n\n', '\n\n  Whew!

And we get that here and it is oh so very delicious!With Neon Gods, we have a Hades & Persephone where the 13 gods & goddesses have been turned into the 13 leaders of the city of Olympus. And the rolls are filled by people seeking to seize power of their own. Persephone’s mother is the new Demeter and when Demeter gives her daughter to Zeus (a man notorious for his wives mysteriously coming up missing) in order to secure more power, Persephone runs to the one place she can’t be followed - across the river Styx. There she is taken in by Hades and the rest is a very smutty history.Sometimes stories don’t give Persephone agency in these retellings, but I had no concern of that when Robert is writing. Our Persephone is sassy, sharp, and she takes what she wants. We also have a brooding grump of a Hades who’s actually a big softy - so really this couple is perfection to me and I had a blast with every second of this book. I cannot wait for more of this series!*Thank you Sourcebooks Casablanca and NetGalley for the ARC*\n\n']"

  #1 NEW YORK TIMES BESTSELLER • Diana Gabaldon returns with the newest novel in the epic Outlander series. The past may seem the safest place to be . . . but it is the most dangerous time to be alive. . . . Jamie Fraser and Claire Randall were torn apart by the Jacobite Rising in 1746, and it took them twenty years to find each other again. Now the American Revolution threatens to do the same. It is 1779 and Claire and Jamie are at last reunited with their daughter, Brianna, her husband, Roger, and their children on Fraser’s Ridge. Having the family together is a dream the Frasers had thought impossible. Yet even in the North Carolina backcountry, the effects of war are being felt. Tensions in the Colonies are great and local feelings run hot enough to boil Hell’s teakettle. Jamie knows loyalties among his tenants are split and it won’t be long until the war is on his doorstep. Brianna and Roger have their own worry: that the dangers that provoked their escape from the twentieth century might catch up to them. Sometimes they question whether risking the perils of the 1700s—among them disease, starvation, and an impending war—was indeed the safer choice for their family. Not so far away, young William Ransom is still coming to terms with the discovery of his true father’s identity—and thus his own—and Lord John Grey has reconciliations to make, and dangers to meet . . . on his son’s behalf, and his own. Meanwhile, the Revolutionary War creeps ever closer to Fraser’s Ridge. And with the family finally together, Jamie and Claire have more at stake than ever before.

Gabaldon is a great storyteller and a very talented writer but it does seem (as other readers have also pointed out) that her writing is being edited less these days and it does now flow or engage in the same way that is does in older books. The use of certain phrases or thoughts too close together in a book really exhausts me and makes me think that the book was not edited properly. (Example, the use of *the character shivered and it had nothing to do with the temperature in the room* kind of thing drives me nuts when I see it more than once in a book, let alone in back to back chapters or scenarios. Maybe I am too particular, but I did not enjoy this book. After 900+ pages I was disappointed and exhausted that the plot did not advance for the characters that mattered, the same 'bluff' was used again as in past books, and the character development of tertiary or menial characters was frustrating. I would love to have the option to hear about these new characters, but in a different book perhaps when the focus isn't constantly being pulled from the characters and stories that I actually want to hear. If you are a fan of the books you will read it regardless  I am sure, but let me warn you that you will get most of the story from a synopsis and save yourself 35+ hours of reading.\n\n"", '\n\n  I am truly grateful that this book arrived here today. I am always excited to receive a new book in this series. Knowing what I do, I take a particular interest in this series.It did just arrive here, less than 30 minutes ago so I have not had time to read the whole thing, but I did read little portions here and there, as well I went to the beginning and read the first few pages. The book arrived in perfect condition and I am looking forward to reading every word within.\n\n', ""\n\n  I gotta say this was the only thing amazon let me down on out of everything I bought this year. I got this book for my mother's birthday and almost feel embarrassed to give it to her because it looks second hand..She is an AVID collector of Outlander and I wanted to surprise her with the latest mega novel..before she bought it herself. When it arrived today it looks like it had sticky fingerprints all over it and there are multiple rips on the sleeve of the book. :(The reason I even gave it 2 stars is because it WILL be coveted nonetheless, she's going to love it. I just think it should have been in better shape for being brand new.\n\n"", '\n\n  This book was such a gift.  I loved the Rachel and Ian storyline, I just wished there was more about them.  I am so glad Ian got another dog.  This was a big read, not complaining, but definitely not a quick one day book.  I liked all the day to day scenes, especially with Francis, she is such a great character.  I hope we find out more about her backstory eventually.  I also hope there is more of Denny and Dorothea in the next book.  I liked that this book was all in the same time/year, much easier to read than the last one.  This is probably one of the best books in the series.  Diana Gabaldon is really the best historical fiction author.  I love Sara Donati as well, they are in another league and I am always grateful when a new book is released!My only frustration is with William.  Why would he be interested in Amaranthus?  She was truly obnoxious, and impossible to like.\n\n', '\n\n  After 7 and a half years wait, I am very happy to be satisfied with the story of Book 9. Was it everything I could have wished for? No. It was also not 1500 pages long. There were parts of the story I would have liked to have more fleshed out. But as a whole, the story was full of action, there were lots of moments when we were brought up to date on minor characters, and parts of the story were resolved. It definitely had less of the political history of books earlier in the Revolution, such as Echo, but the facts of history are easily available to anyone looking. I would definitely add this book to my favorites pile.\n\n', ""\n\n  I'm in the middle of this 9th book in the series and savouring every word.  So far it is all prior to the War of Independence.  All of the usual characters I've come to love and the intertwining of relationships.  The rich tapestry of word the author uses to describe the life and times of the late 1700s and if you pay attention, even stuff that is important to this very day.  Although I'm sure the author uses poetic licence, I love the rich history that flows through the pages and chapters of this and all the previous books.  I just might have to go back and start from Book 1.....AGAIN.\n\n"", '\n\n  I felt like the story was very rushed. For example in other books a surgery would have been a whole chapter of Claire preparing, and then often another just for the procedure, but there were several moments when I was shocked how quickly something was finished or how many months we were jumping forward. I also missed the kind of heart-stopping adventures many of the other books were filled with. At times when a character was in battle or fighting for their life it was over so fast and we weren\'t left wondering their fate (which I suppose is nice of DB) or feeling like they were in trouble for more than a page or two. Compared to Jamie being pressed into the British Navy, or Ian being kidnapped by pirates, or witch trials, or stuffing baddies into the priest hole, this book was tame. And I wasn\'t looking for tame.Maybe part of my disappointment is that I have been waiting so long to read it, and DB had teased so many pieces in her ""daily lines"" on Facebook. If this had been earlier in the series I think I would have given up on finishing the series, and if the first book had been this uneventful then I definitely wouldn\'t have picked up books 2-9. Here\'s hoping number 10 delivers!\n\n', '\n\n  I enjoyed this latest instalment of the Outlander series. Entertaining informative and riveting. Now…. For book 10. Thank you Diana for letting us into your world.\n\n']"

I particularly enjoyed the suspense aspects but would have liked the romance and main characters personal growth to have been developed further.It was also a little difficult to read at times due to the sexual assault and violence and this may be a trigger for some people. Whilst things were resolved to a certain extent it looks like some will be carried over to future books in the series and this facet of the ending was rather improbable too.I received a free copy of this book via Booksprout and am voluntarily leaving a review.\n\n""]"

'Warm, funny, and almost unbearably moving' Daily Mail  'Rescued all those men who constantly mean to read novels but never get round to it' Spectator Books of the Year At first sight, Ove is almost certainly the grumpiest man you will ever meet. He thinks himself surrounded by idiots - neighbours who can't reverse a trailer properly, joggers, shop assistants who talk in code, and the perpetrators of the vicious coup d'etat that ousted him as Chairman of the Residents' Association. He will persist in making his daily inspection rounds of the local streets. But isn't it rare, these days, to find such old-fashioned clarity of belief and deed?

For that reason, I kept putting the book down, and only finished it out of my usual 'reader's obligation'.I won't give away the plot by explaining further, I just wish the 'elephant in the room' had been addressed very differently.

Audrey Coltrane has always wanted to fly. It’s why she implored her father to teach her at the little airfield back home in Texas. It’s why she signed up to train military pilots in Hawaii when the war in Europe began. And it’s why she insists she is not interested in any dream-derailing romantic involvements, even with the disarming Lieutenant James Hart, who fast becomes a friend as treasured as the women she flies with. Then one fateful day, she gets caught in the air over Pearl Harbor just as the bombs begin to fall, and suddenly, nowhere feels safe. To make everything she’s lost count for something, Audrey joins the Women Airforce Service Pilots program. The bonds she forms with her fellow pilots reignite a spark of hope in the face war, and—when James goes missing in action—give Audrey the strength to cross the front lines and fight not only for her country, but for the love she holds so dear. “Captivated me from the first page and never let go...a powerful tale of courage and sacrifice by the Women Airforce Service Pilots during WWII.

The writing was painfully bad and many of the plot twists were just silly and far-fetched. The characters weren’t developed and not believable. It was an interesting premise (and may in fact make for an interesting tv series with some tweaks) but, despite the intriguing concept, the book itself was almost unreadably bad. I forced myself to read it til the end, but regretted each minute spent on it. If you feel the same and are part way through it, just put it down. It doesn’t get better.\n\n', ""\n\n  Didn't know what to expect when I first started reading this book. From reviews I read I knew I was gonna like it, but it wasn't long until twists started to come up one after the other and got me completely hooked. And the twists got better and bigger as I was progressing in the story. The plot was original and cleverly developed. I liked the characters, mostly Christopher whose personality I thought was very well thought of. I highly recommend this book if you like a story with good plot twits. And you'll actually get five great stories for the price of one.\n\n"", '\n\n  I really enjoyed this and though mostly predictable, there were some pretty nice plot twists. I really enjoyed a particular storyline that started off being my least favourite and ended as the only one I was 100% emotionally invested.Characters were well drawn and distinct. I do feel that some of the description was stereotypical, but Marrs did a good job drawing us to their inner world. It was easy to see the characters motivations and understand their action. I don’t feel he played unfair at all, even within the curveballs.Although it felt very modern, so I could recognize the ambience as the present, place was not as rich or descriptive. If it wasn’t for the name of the cities mentioned, any given scene could have taken place anywhere.I do like this kind of book and the build up, as well as different perspective and most chapters ended in a great mini cliff hanger that just made me eager to keep reading to reach the storyline again! It was somewhat original, ma non troppo. It is a concept that has been done before, Marrs managed to leave his mark and make it his own, though. I wish he had taken it further and made another situation morally conflicting.\n\n', ""\n\n  I should have read further into this book. With the first couple of short paragraphs there's a young woman lying dead on the floor having been gruesomely murdered....how original. YAWN! isn't it time to move on from this?\n\n"", ""\n\n  The one thing that stands out in this book is that Marrs is a particularly gifted writer. Specifically, he's written a novel primarily about 5 people that were all at least moderately interesting but written in such a way that I was unable to put it down.The book revolves around a dating program that finds your genetic soulmate. From there Marrs tells us five very different stories that go in plenty of directions, some quite expected (but in a very welcome way) and some not so expected. It tells a story of people desperate for love in a world that says that it can find the person you're meant to be with. It carries with it all of the baggage and the relief of its characters all the time. It's quite lovely.I don't believe it's going to spark any ongoing conversations about the nature of love or dating any time soon, but it's a fun novel that you can't put down. I would recommend it to anyone who wants something heady enough that you have to pay attention but light enough that you don't need to seek out academic articles to explain the ideas.\n\n"", '\n\n  Would you take a DNA test to find your soul mate?  How far would you go to find true love?With a simple swab, you will soon be matched with your genetic soul mate.  That is a promise from Match Your DNA, a company which discovered the gene 10 years ago and has been matching millions of people ever since.When 5 different people are notified that they have been “matched”, they soon find out that nothing is guaranteed and finding true love may come with a price.My thoughts:  I’m quickly becoming a fan of John Marrs, although I’ve only read two books…..so far.  I find his stories different, engaging and well written.  This one was no exception.  It was an entertaining page turner told from multiple POV’s and was exactly what I needed to tune out from the world and just be absorbed in the story.\n\n', '\n\n  I never leave reviews for books as I think that they are completely subjective. However, this book is by far the BEST I have ever read. I have already forced my closest friends and family members to purchase a copy and read it, just so I could talk about it! I have attempted to pick up several books since finishing this one, and none have compared at all. I finished it in two days flat, it was so hard to put down; there truly is a twist on every second page.You would be out of your mind to pass this book over!\n\n', '\n\n  This was SOO good!  I’m so afraid of spoiling anything that I’m practically speechless!  It was certainly not what I was expecting, it was so much MORE.

Yet he is no ordinary killer.

I was hungry for more Witcher stories upon finishing it, so I decided to give the books a try. This first novel is nothing short of amazing. It's obvious why the games became so popular, because they do a great job of reflecting everything the books hold. I actually think that playing the game first helped me enjoy the book even more, because I already felt an attachment to the characters, and it was really cool to get context and backstory on the characters I had grown to love.I just love the way each story plays out, when you think you know who is right and who is wrong, who the real monster of the story is, it flips what you know on it's head and makes you take a completely different stance. I loved it, and I'm excited to continue reading.\n\n"", '\n\n  I was excited to read this after playing the video games of the same name and in anticipation of the upcoming T.V. show. It is very well-written, immersive, and thrilling. Any fantasy lover will be pleased, and for those who are fans of the games, this will offer a much-desired glance further into the Witcher universe.If you\'re new to the series, read this one in the order it was published i.e. after the main trilogy (you can find helpful lists online); this is because while Geralt is obviously prevalent in this story, if you have no prior knowledge of him or any other characters, you may find the descriptions somewhat lacking and have trouble imagining him. If you\'re a fan of the Witcher game, you can read this before starting the rest of the books (like I did), thus reading it in the chronological order of the world of the Witcher. As far as character development goes, I really found that this added to Yennifer, who I strongly disliked in the games (Team Triss!); I understood her motivations more than I did before, and I was able to even feel compassionately towards her, which surprised me.The books itself is made up of several short stories--interesting, not what I expected! The nods to age-old fairytales--and the twists on them--is a bonus; it plays on readers\' existing knowledge and lends to the nostalgia that arises from remembering the fairytales of our childhood. The episodes are generally ""stand-alone"" -- tidbits of Geralt\'s life as a Witcher and the people and beasts he encounters. There are nods to things going on in the world at large (politics, conflicts, etc.). However, there is one larger story that threads its way through the books, titled, ""The Voice of Reason."" This story appears episodically, interspersed with the other tales, which breaks up the ""quest-style"" narrative format by grounding the larger story in a chronological time.\n\n', ""\n\n  The Last Wish (the book that is) follows the story of Geralt of Rivia, a mutant monster slayer, as he recovers in a temple after he sustained a severe wound in a prior fight. This story is essentially interrupted at regular intervals by flash-backs and dreams which represent independent short-stories recounting previous adventures by the witcher. The stories told in this book are excellent, exciting and eventful. The writing however is somewhat tedious and laborious. I had to read many paragraphs many times before I could advance which sometimes kills the fun.I've played the games first then watched the Netflix show second. This book represents an excellent opportunity for the gamers to learn about the origin stories of the main protagonists (a subject the games don't broach and only reference very quickly). As for the show, this book is essentially season 1 minus the war and Yennefer's origin story. There are minor differences between the book and the show however.I ordered the hardcover version which doesn't feature a dust jacket like it's usually the case with hardcovers. All in all, the book feels nice but the cover warps in a weird way as the book is used.This is a good buy and I highly recommend it.\n\n"", '\n\n  I could say a great deal about the world-famous monster hunter. Geralt of Rivia is a truly exceptional individual. A brief encounter might tempt one to label him a mere swinger of swords, a simple monster-catcher, a rough-and-tumble practitioner of a dirty trade - but peer closer and you will soon discover he is a man of unplumbed depths, unique views and vast, world-spanning experience.\n\n']"

The lead female was desperate and she caved to the lead male way too easily and made excuses for him about his betrayal.Lead male is an unintelligent, weak, cheater with no morals. He is obsessed with his ex, and yes, he not only wanted her but holds and kisses her even when he is supposed to be in love with his wife. Took the idiot wife to ‘set things straight’ while he stood by like a simpleton watching. What a pathetic excuse for a man - I certainly would not have bothered to fight for him!\n\n', '\n\n  The blurb and title stood out, because I adore Eliza Jane Wilder from the Little House on the Prairie TV series, and always wished she’d get a happy ending of her own.The author did not disappoint.  Eliza, a wallflower, is on the marriage mart.  As for the duke, Dax, he needs an heir, but he won’t marry just anyone after being jilted by his ex-fiancée who ran off and married his best friend.The book gets down to business in the opening chapter by introducing Eliza and her sisters.  I must say the eldest sister, the bossy but vulnerable Viv, really stood out:  her marriage, her predicament, and if she’ll do something about it. It makes me wonder if there is a story for her, and for the other two sisters and the brother.  I really enjoyed this family and hope the series concentrates on them.Anyhoo, back to the review.  I really liked Dax and Eliza.  Both are quite different in looks and personality.  Eliza is given a wonderful character arc, growing from a shy, nervous wallflower to a strong woman who can stand on her own two feet, and even give the duke a much-needed push when he needs one.As for the duke, he’s a bit of a mess.  After being jilted by his two best friends, he’s at a loss of what to do, and the only one thing he can guarantee himself is to never fall in love if he marries a plain-looking woman.  But right from their first meeting, he’s hooked.  He senses something special about Eliza—special enough for him to ask her brother for Eliza’s hand in marriage.I enjoyed how they married quickly, and their marriage became one where they had to find their footing.  Would it be another marriage of convenience or could they make what they shared work?The writing is excellent.  The author somehow manages to keep a tired and true plot, with tired and true plot devices, fresh.  I mean, I did groan at one point when I saw what was coming for the couple, but there’s something about Ms. Clever’s writing that kept me reading.

His mother is worried that he’ll be eternally single. She has the brilliant idea for her and her husband to get dressed up in their Holiday best and escort their son into Seattle to bar crawl for women. Their goal is to be the ultimate wingmen for their son. Nora is stressed out and hating life at her family’s bakery. She’s gone to the Dirty Beaver to unwind and decompress. While at the bar, she runs into Coopers parents who are family friends. Turns out, Nora is best friends with Coopers ex-wife…the one he just finalized his divorce for. Cooper and Nora end up spending the ultimate night out together.This book was freaking hilarious. I couldn’t stop laughing during the first part of the book. Coopers parents were so funny. Down to their Holiday outfits and their banter back and forth. I can’t believe he took his parents to a place called the Dirty Beaver. I thought this book was so well written. I didn’t know going into it that it would lead to a longer novel that’s set to be released in 2022. I’m happy at least that Nora and Coopers story doesn’t end where it did. I’m excited to read more in the coming year.If you want to read something funny, sexy and heartwarming…check out this book.\n\n', '\n\n  There was no indication in the description that this wasn’t a novella or short story, but merely a tiny fragment. More of an extended situation set up, before the story begins. Personally, I didn’t feel the main characters had any sexual chemistry and clearly the man wasn’t even thinking about it through most of it. They never spoke about the issue at hand (the best friend ex-husband issue), she never texted her bff for “permission”, they just got drunk and went to it. Boring and then just abruptly cut off.\n\n', '\n\n  This is a short story, it is more like a synopsis.I would not recommend it for that reason alone.\n\n', '\n\n  This book had me laughing-out-loud! I just loved Cooper and Nora ... they are perfect for each other even though they don\'t know it. Cooper is sweet ... the way he takes care of his parents when all they want is for him to find someone and be happy. Nora works hard at the family bakery and with long hours she doesn\'t have time for a relationship, but one night ... yeah, she can handle that. Cooper\'s parents were a hoot ... ""being his wingmen"" ... still makes me laugh. I was glad to hear that their story continues in ""The Reunion"" because this book was way too short and I know there is so much more to their story. I can\'t wait!I received an early copy courtesy of Montlake through NetGalley in exchange for a honest review.\n\n', ""\n\n  I enjoyed this novella giving us insight in to Cooper and Nora's one night stand they had before meeting again a year later. It was a quick and an easy read! I enjoyed the humor in this novella having Cooper's parents being his wingmen was so hilarious. I definitely would recommend this novella to others.\n\n""]"

Her relationship with Sin is one that’s complex, full of steamy moments, and I honestly had to be almost at the end of the book before liking him.

A little smar alec girl puts him in his place. Great banter. Sexy. Loved it.\n\n', '\n\n  If weak women and arrogant billionaires are your thing you will get this series more than three stars I gave it. I read the whole series by the way. Most of the women were from poor/humble beginnings and in debt. Not a turn off because they were striving to make their own way. But no matter how sexy or rich these men were, it cheapens the women that A) they werent self-respecting enough to walk away when they were offered large amounts of money for favours, and B) they just ""melted"" and gave in after a kiss. C\'MON!!! Really?? That turn me off on the series. I did give it three stars because The Seven each had their own issues from THE INCIDENT and that was kind of interesting to ferret out and took creativity to come up with. Sadly though they claimed to be strong women to be able to get through to these men, IMHO they were really won over by the lifestyle more than anything. These women seemed to fall madly in love with these guys over the money and sexy looks rather than getting to the bottom of who they were and why first. Made them seem more like opportunists. Would rather they find out what great guys they really were before THEN fall for them. Also like to note these books could have been easily been written with a hundred pages less in each ... you have to get at least halfway through the book before the hero and heroine finally got together and it was really the same pattern just the names, and the INCIDENT changed. Not the worst books I\'ve ever read for sure but In fairness they deserve no more the three star rating.\n\n', '\n\n  Definite hate at first sight between Summer and Sinclair (Sin).  He\'s orchestrated it all for revenge that Summer has no idea about.  Definitely a dark and gritty book, and many, many ways this series can go with all the characters in the 7. ""We are opposite, and yet we fit.""  ""Your every response is my salvation.""  She challenges him at ever turn and I love all the names that she calls him, they are hilarious.  I really enjoyed this book and will definitely read more by this author.  ""Blah-bloody-blah""I voluntarily reviewed this book.\n\n']"

  AN INSTANT #1 NEW YORK TIMES BESTSELLER​ Named one of the most anticipated novels of the season by People, Associated Press, Time, Los Angeles Times, Parade, St. Louis Post-Dispatch, The Guardian, Publishers Weekly, and more. From the #1 bestselling authors Hillary Clinton and Louise Penny comes a novel of unsurpassed thrills and incomparable insider expertise—State of Terror.After a tumultuous period in American politics, a new administration has just been sworn in, and to everyone’s surprise the president chooses a political enemy for the vital position of secretary of state.  There is no love lost between the president of the United States and Ellen Adams, his new secretary of state. But it’s a canny move on the part of the president. With this appointment, he silences one of his harshest critics, since taking the job means Adams must step down as head of her multinational media conglomerate. As the new president addresses Congress for the first time, with Secretary Adams in attendance, Anahita Dahir, a young foreign service officer (FSO) on the Pakistan desk at the State Department, receives a baffling text from an anonymous source. Too late, she realizes the message was a hastily coded warning. What begins as a series of apparent terrorist attacks is revealed to be the beginning of an international chess game involving the volatile and Byzantine politics of Pakistan, Afghanistan, and Iran; the race to develop nuclear weapons in the region; the Russian mob; a burgeoning rogue terrorist organization; and an American government set back on its heels in the international arena. As the horrifying scale of the threat becomes clear, Secretary Adams and her team realize it has been carefully planned to take advantage of four years of an American government out of touch with international affairs, out of practice with diplomacy, and out of power in the places where it counts the most. To defeat such an intricate, carefully constructed conspiracy, it will take the skills of a unique team: a passionate young FSO; a dedicated journalist; and a smart, determined, but as yet untested new secretary of state. State of Terror is a unique and utterly compelling international thriller cowritten by Hillary Rodham Clinton, the 67th secretary of state, and Louise Penny, a multiple award-winning #1 New York Times bestselling novelist.

I was pleased to learn that Louise Penny and Hilary Clinton were collaborating on a political thriller. I preordered this book well in advance. I regret to say that although it contained much intrigue and action, it failed to captivate me. It should appeal more to those more interested in American politics, but definitely not to Trump fans. I have enjoyed Louise Penny's stories set in Three Pines with their kind and quirky villagers. Her part in writing the book was apparent in its style but did not fit the political thriller format well. Hilary brings her vast experience and knowledge gained during her time in the White House as First Lady and as Secretary of State to describe past and present world problems. Some have called this a work of revenge against Trump, depicting the former fictional president in the book under a different name, but it is clearly ex-President Trump referred to in the story. At his Palm Beach estate, the former President is described as incompetent, sleazy, narcissistic, a bully, and acting from his own delusions. He cozied up to the country's enemies and left former allies in a state of distrust causing a loss of prestige for America. In such an environment of division, the Taliban and El-Qaeda have thrived. There is a long, complex and convoluted plot. There were descriptions of thrills, danger, and intrigue in too many places, with characters widely scattered in various countries. I was not feeling the excitement and tension the way I was supposed to but kept plodding along. The book was strongly pro-female, usually brave, scheming, and intelligent women. They were able to outsmart heads of state, even blackmailing the Russian President to achieve their goals. The plot was constantly in motion, zipping back and forth to Pakistan, the Afghan border territories, Oman, Iran, Germany, Russia, Palm Springs, Washington, and even Three Pines, Quebec. The male characters played supporting roles to the women. With a few exceptions, they were duplicitous, treacherous, victims, secretive, or dull.  I thought references to literature and poetry were thrown in for us to admire the writing but didn't work for me except as a distraction.  The phone code between the Secretary of State and her trusted assistant was annoying, except for people wanting to catch up on grammatical terms, and seemed out of place in a thriller. There were repetitions about the newly appointed Secretary of State, Ellen Adams, being dishevelled, dirty, with messy hair and without makeup while rushing from one country and meeting to the next, and speculation why the incoming President had chosen her in an important role. She was head of a newspaper empire that was very critical of this new President, and he carries a hatred for her.  Her first assignment was to South Korea, one designed to fail. The first strike by terrorists was to blow up buses in London, Paris, and Frankfurt. Each bus was carrying a low-level nuclear scientist, and the explosions resulted in many innocent civilian causalities. There are hints and clues that three nuclear bombs have been planted in American locations. These were manufactured in an old warehouse in Pakistan. Ellen Adams has assembled a team, consisting of her good friend and assistant, Betsy, her son and daughter and various trusted colleagues to travel to various destinations to find out in what American cities the nuclear bombs are planted and try to discover people behind the terrorist conspiracy before the bombs detonate. They are prepared to use diplomacy and more underhanded means of coercion to save innumerable lives. There may be someone within the White House providing information to the terrorists.  I was sorry to feel so disconnected from the storyline. I have noticed that many enjoyed the book and found it thrilling. I have noticed that some people who dislike Hilary gave the book abysmal reviews without reading it to skew the ratings downward. This should not be permitted on any review site, and either read the book and judge it on its merits or not rate or comment on something they have not read.\n\n"", ""\n\n  I have read all of Louise Penny's books and eagerly looked forward to this new venture with Hilary Clinton.Sadly, it did not live up to my expectation and I would not recommend to family or friends.\n\n"", '\n\n  Fast paced, extremely well written- and extremely disturbing. Truly a novel of our times, touching not just on the terror of a nuclear bomb threat, but also on the growing chasms in our world. The rising sense of disenfranchisement between people in our society, the threat brought by social media to the perceptions of reality and the growing inability and worse, unwillingness of people to demand facts and truth. Louise Penny brings her exceptional insights into human behaviour and motivations while Hillary Clinton brought the insider knowledge of high level politics and diplomacy. This was an extremely synergistic collaboration between great writers, I hope they have future projects together planned!\n\n', '\n\n  When the CBC News anchor, Adrienne Arsenault, interviewed the co-authors of this political thriller it was abundantly clear that thriller writer Louise Penny and former Secretary of State Hilary Clinton had enjoyed their collaboration so much that the book was sure to be a winner. It is.The plot line is made all the more believable because so much of US politics over the past six years is woven into the experience of the fictional Secretary of State, Ellen Adams. Clinton and Penny base much of their captivating story on real world events and international relationships between both allies and enemies. The authors manage to describe both former and present world leaders when introducing fictional characters. As a perfect example, one leader is described as having dishevelled hair and being an upper class nit-wit. I wonder to whom that might refer? Another character living in Palm Beach spends a lot of time playing golf.The book tells a tale of intrigue culminating in an attempted coup resulting from right-wing activists upset by the result of a presidential election. It holds the reader’s attention from the first page to the last as the fictional Secretary of State hops around the world in her attempts to solve the political puzzles she faces.In their respective acknowledgements both authors express apprehension about stepping outside the boundaries of their normal genres, thrillers (Penny) and non-fiction (Clinton). With this book they have clearly demonstrated that such apprehension was ill-founded.\n\n', '\n\n  Too too too many acronyms for offices in the US administration.  Got bored very quickly. A tedious read. Hope it gets better.\n\n', ""\n\n  I had looked forward to reading this book, as it was written by two women I admire. Unfortunately, it had none of the charm or warmth of Penny's Three Pines series. Neither did it keep me on the edge of my seat, despite the title and subject matter. It seemed dull and lacking personality, and I eventually gave up reading before reaching the end.\n\n"", ""\n\n  I loved how it switched to Three Pines and the Gamache characters from Louise Penny's mystery series about Inspector Gamache. It softened the harshness of the previous parts about the Rangers all dying etc. It brought the story home to family and friends. Just as two friends wrote the book it kept the weaving of the politics with the humaneness we hope to find in our democracies. I hope there'll be more of these books.\n\n"", '\n\n  I’ve read all of Louise Penny’s books and thoroughly enjoyed them.  This one did not disappoint.  Great storyline, well developed characters and kept me enthralled to the very end.  A great  fictional story but makes one think about the things that could actually happen given the situation in our world right now.\n\n']"

  A guide to the surprising benefits of music on your mind, spirit, and body—complete with sound-based breathing and meditation exercises Since 1991, Dr. Mitchell Gaynor has been achieving remarkable results by integrating music, vocalization, breathing, and meditation techniques in his work with patients. In The Healing Power of Sound, he presents his sound-based techniques for self-healing—techniques that anyone can use, whether faced with a life-threatening disease or simply seeking relief from the stresses of daily life. Numerous studies have demonstrated the health benefits of music: it can lower blood pressure and heart and respiratory rates; reduce cardiac complications; increase the immune response; and boost our natural opiates. Gaynor shows how, when integrated as part of a mind-body-spirit approach to wellness, music can play a significant part in maintaining a healthy lifestyle or in healing serious disease. The Healing Power of Sound includes twelve exercises involving breathing, meditation, and “toning”—using pure vocal sound to resolve tension, release emotion, and spur the healing process—that can be used by anyone to improve health and quality of life.

The Huntress is an interesting story but didn't capture my heart the way that one did.\n\n"", '\n\n  The Huntress /  Die JagerinThis book captures your attention immediately at the beginning. The Huntress character Lorelei Vogt,  is based on two real people who embodied such evil. The set up of the book of the main characters is educational and interesting. It embodies women pilots in Russia during WW2 called the Night Witches. The stories of their lives, their flying expeditions over the German Lines is informative and interesting. The way the author connects a Russian female pilot to a British escaped Prisoner of war and their escape through Poland captures the reader to want to know the outcome. Fast forward to the Nuremberg trials and 2 men looking for a woman they call the Huntress. Their trips around Western Europe, then across to USA, the difficulties they had, the people they met who The Huntress had influenced and killed. The chase and the people she wouldn’t hesitate to kill was frightening. She went to great lengths to save herself.The team of four people whose lives had been affected by The Huntress wanted to obtain justice, and they did through a lot of hard work.

You can never read too many books about the Holocaust because we must never forget!!  This book is another great one!  It is simple in its structure and therefore accessible to every level of reader.  The character of Nina and the historical facts make this book amazing. Highly recommend!  It is also a good Holocaust literature book for a younger reader (teens 14-18) too because it is accurate but also not as gruesome in every detail as some others.  It would be good for a high school class actually. It has gay themes too, which is important for younger readers.  I loved this book. However, if you are a racist, sexist or homophobic, this is not the book for you....or is it? ;)\n\n', ""\n\n  I could hardly put this book down!  The characters were vibrant and so real.

The author certainly knew what she was doing when she wove this particular tale together.\n\n"", ""\n\n  This was a real page turner.  I liked the format.  The chapters alternate between the three chief characters.  The chapters are short which makes for easier reading.  The chapters on Nina and her flying excursions are so real that one thinks they're with her.  One learns early on who the huntress is which adds to thrill of the chase.  Highly recommend.\n\n"", '\n\n  This is a riveting story of the search to bring a diabolical female Nazi war criminal to justice.

This is a fun, down-to-Earth, clean rom-com and I look forward to reading the next book in the series. I recommend it.\n\n', '\n\n  I throughly enjoyed this novel. Read it in one day, just couldn’t put it down 😍 such a lovely read with great characters, some you love and some you love to hate. Well worth the purchase.\n\n', ""\n\n  -My first thought of the story was that it would be foolish of Emma. Foolish dressing up in sweats while everyone else is dressed up to the nines, including Mr. Darcy and his BFF and the hostess, Mrs. Watson. Not only you would bring everyone's eyes on you but you would be kicked out of the show ASAP, and not necessarily by the producers. None will remember you in a good way either (and they didn't), which is bad marketing for your business Timothy.-Editing: I'm not sure if I received an ARC or not but the editing needs another pass. Mostly apostrophes where they don't belong (historian's), special characters (wish I didn't \\), too many words (But I what none of us).-Any kind of competition, especially with a great prize, will get you these kind of people: mean, sweet, totally naïve, and the weird ones. Dating Mr. Darcy's competitors are completely in character with this. One by one, you see their real personality and that was fun.-Sebastian and Emma's romance is fast and hidden from everyone. I'm not too sure when Emma did fall but I can understand Sebastian's time when he did. Emma is a walking disaster.-It's delightful all through the book but the end is to die for. It made me cry so much I loved it. I was racking my brains, along with Emma, to try to understand what had gone wrong.\n\n"", '\n\n  What a delightful book! It was witty and funny and had me chuckling throughout. The author definitely has a way with words and her many characterizations were spot on.Both Emma and Sebastian had agreed to be on the Bachelor type reality TV show (with a Regency twist) for reasons other than finding true love. What they didn\'t expect was falling for each other! I liked that Emma wasn\'t pretentious and nor did she take herself too seriously. Being told solely from the heroine\'s point of view made Sebastian that much more elusive and I was eager to find out more about him as the story progressed.It was a clean rom-com that is sure to bring some humour and lightness to your day. I loved the modern references to Jane Austen\'s literary world that weren\'t over the top or too literal as is often the case. Now I can\'t wait for the sequel ""Marrying Mr. Darcy"" due out November 10, 2020.I received a free copy of this book and am voluntarily leaving a review. All opinions expressed are solely my own.\n\n', '\n\n  I tend to be disappointed with contemporary romances, but wow, I loved this charming story.I was with Emma for the entire story: there were moments when I was laughing, stubborn, or jealous, and there were moments when I was blindsided by the twists. However predictable the story may be, it was impossible not to be fully invested. This felt like re-reading your favourite story; deep down you know how it will end, but your heart is racing flipping pages just in case you\'re incorrect. There is drama and rivalry, the dating show is a competition and would be pretty boring without out, but there is also endearing depictions of female friendships that are not comprised throughout the story I was not expecting.This is NOT a Pride and Prejudice retelling in any way, if anything, this is much more of a Dating Show story. Emma signs up for a dating show that happens to have P&P theme, which if you think is a silly premise for a dating show, I will remind you there was an actual, real life, dating show called ""I Want to Marry Harry"" where the contests actually thought the bachelor was Price Harry of England. Go watch a trailer than tell me Dating Mr. Darcy isn\'t much more realistic than that mess. You do not need to be a fan of Jane Austen to read this book, but you will equally enjoy it if you are.\n\n', '\n\n  I laughed so hard my sides still hurt. In this adaptation of Pride and Prejudice with a reality-TV spin, we get humor, sweetness, angst, drama, and a dose of just plain crazy. Emma is just adorable. She’s the everywoman-kind of character that I can relate to easily. She’s occasionally clumsy, often snarky, and someone I just couldn’t help but cheer on to victory. Sebastian could be the poster child for the classic British reserve and stiff upper lip. But he’s hiding a world of secrets that could bring them closer or tear them all apart. I think this is the first book I’ve read from this author, but it certainly won’t be my last.I received a complimentary advanced copy of this book through Hidden Gems Books.\n\n', '\n\n  I shouldn’t have started this book so late in the day, because I stayed up until past 4:00 a.m. to finish it.  Once I started reading, I couldn’t put it down.  It is a fun, modern, P&P romp that had me laughing out loud.  The dialogue is thoroughly entertaining and funny.  I could see this done into a Bridget Jones-type screenplay.  It’s a bit cheesy in places, and I would have liked to see more time given to their budding romance, but otherwise, I thought it was well done.  Some proofreading misses.  I do recommend it for JAFF addicts like me who may enjoy a break from the typical P&P variations that take place during Regency.\n\n', '\n\n  A surprisingly wonderful book! Emma and her partner are looking for a way to promote their new clothing line. What better place to do that than on a reality dating show. Sebastian is the bachelor, a perfect Mr. Darcy with an English accent and a mansion in England. Emma is feisty and determined. I delighted in the interplay between these two, each with their own secrets. The other characters are varied and interesting, the relationships feel real and the humour made me laugh-out-loud. I recommend this book. I received a free copy of this book. The honest opinions in this review are my own.\n\n']"

Romeo and Vittoria’ s story is gripping and passionate. Captivating intense characters with a tantalizing and alluring storyline. Congratulations Jane! 👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻\n\n', '\n\n  I voluntarily reviewed a cooy of ""OATH OF SILENCE"".  This story hooks you right from the start full of suspense, intrigue, deception, secrets, lies, betrayal, humor, steamy scenes, mystery, family loyalty, danger, killing, twists you never saw coming addicting story for sure.Vittoria DeSanto was totally ripped off everything she had in her bank account her ex-boyfriend took her everything now living out of her car in Boston she was invited to Gustav Montavio\'s reading of his Will his lawyer Gerardo Rocco sent her the invite at his request she was summoned so didn\'t think she couldn\'t not go.Vittoria stops at a bar for a drink when a stranger sits at the bar with her buys her food & drink hes looking for a one might stand she sneaks out back he catchs her & almost rapes her when Romeo Rossi steps in she ends up seeing him kill the guy he tells her if I hear whisper of this on the wind what he was going to do to you is nothing compared to what I\'ll do now take off.Romeo Rossi & family all gather for his mother Tosca\'s father Gustav Montavio\'s Will reading only certain family members are allowed in the room to his shock when the lawyer asks where Vittoria DeSanto is everyone one but Marialena knows who that is Romeo when their eyes meet she sees the deathly stare he gives her she knows something about him that could cause problems.I definitely recommend to get this book such an interesting entertaining story the chemistry between Vittoria & Romeo heats up he needs a wife to take over the throne become Boss of Rosso family his father Narciso Rossi is crazy insane needs to be removed but thorough all this Vittoria doesn\'t who they all are what will happen when she finds out will try to run you have to get this very well written book to see what happens.I\'m so looking forward to the next hook in this series ""OATH OF OBEDIENCE""  which is Orlando\'s story, all the characters were well written hope they all get their own story especially Marialena I loved her character she a little spitfire.\n\n', '\n\n  Vittoria DeSantos, homeless and hungry, goes int a bar in Boston for a much needed food and a drink.  She is approached by a stranger who buys her dinner and expects a one night stand in exchange.  Running away, she is caught and assaulted by him.  She is rescued by Romeo Rossi, another stranger who kills her assailant.  Witnessing the murder, Romeo orders her to flee, keep silent, forget the “ unfortunate turn of events” and to never approach him again unless she wants to pay the ultimate price.  Although Vittoria is clueless as to who is Romeo, she takes the warning to heart. And thus, begins Vittoria’s daring and bizarre journey into what is known as the Rossi Family. The plot is engrossing as nothing is what it seems. The characters are genuine and entertaining. It is especially amusing that Romeo’s sisters do their best to teach him about romance in order to help him with seducing Vittoria.  Regrettably, the advise is not always helpful and provides another layer of enjoyment to the story.Definitely a ‘must read’ and am very much looking forward to reading about the other Rossi family members.\n\n', ""\n\n  Vittoria is way out of her league when she is sent to a reading of a will for someone she does not even know. She walks in to find the man that saved her the previous night.  Talk about throwing the lamb to slaughter. Nice intrigue in this story with people you love to hate and you hate to love.

  Clark Griswold was onto something, at least with his annual holiday meltdown. And since the last three weeks of my life have been riddled with humbug—another breakup, a broken toe, an office promotion I deserved and didn’t get—I’m not at all in the mood to celebrate nor have the happ, happ, happiest Christmas EVER.When Mom insisted that we all gather at my Grandparent’s ancient cabin for an old school family Christmas, I fully intended to get into the holiday spirit with the help of the three wise men, Johnnie Walker, Jack Daniels, and Jim Beam. But those boys did absolutely nothing to offset the shock or temper the sting of seeing my EX on our doorstep the first day of our holiday soiree.Apparently, Santa missed the memo, and this elf is pissed.Stuck for a week with the man who obliterated my heart nearly two decades ago, I did the only thing I could do and put on my game face, thankful for the home advantage.I knew better than to drink that last cup of eggnog.I knew better than to get tongue tangled beneath the mistletoe with the only man to ever break my heart.I knew better than to sleep with Satan’s wingman on the eve of the Lord’s birthday.I could blame the nog. I could blame the deceitful light blue eyes, thick, angelic hair, and panty evaporating smirk…but mostly, I blame Eli because he always knew exactly which of my buttons to push.I foolishly thought a family Christmas filled with nostalgia was going to turn my inner Scrooge around, but this year’s festivities went up in flames.

  From bestselling author Scarlett St. Clair comes a dark and enthralling reimagining of the Hades and Persephone Greek myth. ""Let me worship you,"" he said.She remembered the words she had whispered to him in the back of the limo after La Rose. ""You will worship me, and I won't even have to order you."" His request felt sinful and devious, and she reveled in it.She answered, ""Yes.""Persephone is the Goddess of Spring in title only. Since she was a little girl, flowers have only shriveled at her touch. After moving to New Athens, she hoped to lead an unassuming life disguised as a mortal journalist. All of that changes when she sits down in a forbidden nightclub to play a hand of cards with a hypnotic and mysterious stranger.Hades, God of the Dead, has built a gambling empire in the mortal world and his favorite bets are rumored to be impossible. But nothing has ever intrigued him as much as the goddess offering him a bargain he can't resist.After her encounter with Hades, Persephone finds herself in a contract with the God of the Dead, and his terms are impossible: Persephone must create life in the Underworld or lose her freedom forever. The bet does more than expose Persephone's failure as a goddess, however. As she struggles to sow the seeds of her freedom, love for the God of the Dead grows—a love that is both captivating and forbidden.

You would never hear me complain about sex scenes at all. I love them.\u2029Whenever I see a Hades and Persephone retelling, it’s a automatic buy for me. I love reading how everyone takes the story between them and made it their own and I will say this one is will entertaining. It did not take long for Hades and Persephone to meet in the book and I liked that, perfect amount of waiting. As soon as we meet Hades, he’s just so intriguing and delicious.\u2029Let’s talk about Persephone, I liked her very much but there’s something about her that I couldn’t pin down. I think it’s because she still trying to find herself since her mother had her locked away for her entire life that she still learning and we have to learn with her progress as well. But we can agree she’s not that good with journalism. Like she did nothing at that internship and she was barely there as well. I was surprised they did not let her go at all, that one little article must have been amazing or her boss has something up his sleeves..I liked her their relationship progress throughout the book and how Persephone was starting to feel Underworld as home to her. My favourite “side characters” were Hecate, Hermes and Lexa. I loved them all whenever they were on scene and I want them as my BFF please.I would definitely recommend if you like different takes on mythology retelling plus explicit sex scenes. I would also recommend listening to the audiobook because it captured the story so perfectly and the way the sex scenes were read was so good.\n\n', ""\n\n  This book was so hyped on book Tok and I was let down. I really liked the idea but the execution was poo. The smut wasn't badly written but the plot and some characters were lacking. Persephone for example I wanted to love but just found her so annoying and immature. Hades I feel was well done and was by far a more complex and developed character. It reads more like a contemporary novel than a fantasy so if you're into that go for it.\n\n"", ""\n\n  This book was an experience, let me tell you.I knew this novel was a modernized story of Hades and Persephone but I didn't expect that the main characters would actually BE Hades and Persephone. I know, if I read a synopsis I would have known this easily but I like to go into my novels with little to no information about the story.So with that being said, expect this novel to be somewhat of a fantastical/paranormal romance. I wouldn't say there is a lot of fantasy elements but it's combined into the story to make it more of an urban fantasy.As I made my way through the story, I warmed up to it more and more. I became fascinated with how the author modernized greek mythology and made this story her own. It was a uniquely different story, it was certainly entertaining, and the writing is done in a way where it captures the reader making it difficult to put the book down.I actually rounded up my rating after reading because I couldn't stop thinking about this story and started the next book in the series the very next day.\n\n"", '\n\n  I’m a huge fan of Greek lore, and the stories of Persephone and Hades is among my favourites. I’m always interested on new takes, and this one did so in unique way while still keeping close ties to different legends. It also has a ton of steam and great characters, which have made me eager for more.One of the highlights for me was Persephone. She is such a realistic character. I relate to her so much and cheered her on as she learned to stand up for herself and live the life she wanted. She was a great foil for Hades, who fills the role of kind, brooding protector. I liked seeing their bond blossom, but I also found it interesting just watching Persephone grapple with her own abilities and self.The romance is red hot and leads to some great intimate scenes. I also loved the scenes of Persephone speaking with various gods and legendary figures like Minthe and Adonis. This seemed to be a book more based on emotion and action, though there were some intense scenes near the end. Persephone’s power is not to be trifled with!I had so much fun reading this book. I genuinely looked forward to starting it every single day and am very interested to see what could happen next. The ending could make this seem like a standalone, but I’m attached enough to Hades, Persephone, Hecate, and Lexa that I want to experience more of their adventures. Highly recommended for anyone who loves Hades/Persephone lore, urban fantasy, steam romance, and new twists on old tales!\n\n', '\n\n  The book was really interesting. It’s a retell of Hades and Persephone’s love story. It challenges the reader on their view of Hades, to see him as more than what many have grown accustomed to. The Devil, Hercule’s evil uncle. It’s really interesting. It was also intriguing to learn about the Goddess of Spring and how she ends up becoming Queen of the Underworld.There were some parts where the writing was on the weaker side, but overall I enjoyed the contemporary feel of the book and the ideas and themes explored. Can’t wait to start the next book!\n\n', '\n\n  This book was recommended to me by someone with similar taste, and the premise of a modern Hades & Persephone story intrigued me. I am an avid fan of Rick Riordan, so I thought this would be similar, but more focused on the romance. I got a disappointing x-rated-focused novel, with no depth, and barely any character development. I liked the imagined world where greek gods live and mingle with mortals, but other than that the story is bland and the writing is not the best.\n\n', ""\n\n  So first of all, the book cover is beautiful and has a really nice texture.It's a light easy read and if you liked 50 shades of gray you'll like this book too.  It's a neat rendering of the Greek gods.  I did however find it fell a bit flat, from story line to character development.  The spicy scenes certainly delivered though! Considering it wasn't my most enjoyable read I think I'd still read the rest of the series\n\n""]"

Once I started reading, I couldn’t put it down. Secrets surround Jes and her family which also added mystery to the story. By the time I finished, I was an emotional wreck and needed a hug. Yes, I grew that attached to Jes.Note: This is book one of five so obviously there are loose ends and a semi cliffhanger but it doesn’t detract from the overall story.

  She fears the dark.He rules it.Her dresses are too tight, her heels too tall. She laughs too loudly, eats without decorum, and mixes up most sayings in the book. Little do most know it’s just a sparkly disguise, there to hide one panic attack at a time.Nobody can crack Gianna’s facade . . . no one anyway, until he comes along.Most see a paragon of morality; a special agent upholding the law. In the New York underworld, others know him as a hustler, a killer, his nature as cold as the heart of ice in his chest. Christian Allister has always followed the life plan he’d envisioned in his youth, beneath the harsh lights of a frigid, damp cell. With a proclivity for order and the number three, he’s never been tempted to veer off course. But perhaps one should never say never . . .One winter night and their lives intertwine. She hates him—his stone-cold demeanor, his arrogance and too-perceptive eye—but over the years, even as their games consist of insulting each other’s looks and intelligence, she begins to live to play with him.Nowhere in Christian’s plans had he ever prepared for Gianna. She’s chaos embodied, not his type, and married, but none of that can stop his eyes from following her wherever she goes.All along, she doesn’t even know that she’s his—his frustration, his fascination.His maddest obsession.*Can be read as a standalone, though it is recommended you read The Sweetest Oblivion first to avoid spoilers from Book #1   Read more  ","['4.0 out of 5 stars', '5.0 out of 5 stars', '5.0 out of 5 stars', '4.0 out of 5 stars', '5.0 out of 5 stars', '5.0 out of 5 stars', '5.0 out of 5 stars', '5.0 out of 5 stars']","['\nLoved these two!\n', '\nObsessed!\n', '\nAmazing !!!

  In Oceania, one of three totalitarian states that rule the world, Big Brother is watching. The Thought Police are listening. Reality is defined by the Party.

In defiance of the State, he falls into a criminal love affair with his coworker Julia. But it isn’t until he joins the Brotherhood, an underground network of revolutionaries, that Winston discovers how high the cost of freedom may be.

A false sense of security so to hide long-term goals ...Most of all we become more conscious of how the manipulation of information is a real and profound threat to the world and the environnement who sustains us.This book should be read by people who really care about their children.

They wrote exciting novels, adventures that made me dream.This book is difficult to read. The author occasionally describes action and romance, but spends much more time hammering totalitarian ideas and describing a dark future. George Orwell spent several pages detailing torture! Why?He wanted to scare us -- I\'m scared. He warned of a possible dystopia if we don\'t change, but did not offer a solution. Orwell repeated the core ideas several times without much purpose, which made reading boring.Every character in this story feels miserable. I reached the end and still found no relief or resolution of the protagonist\'s troubles. Winston Smith did not learn anything from his terrible life; he was not rewarded for suffering.""Nineteen eighty four"" is far from enjoyable to read. I am giving ** out of ***** for some world-building and fantastic crime scenes. Overall, though, this made me feel depressed, which is not the goal of a literary piece of entertainment.\n\n']"

  From USA Today bestselling author of The Highland Fling comes a brand new romantic comedy about a desperate billionaire seeking to find a fiancée. This modern day take on Pretty Woman is brilliantly clever and hilariously page-turning. How did you two meet? The quintessential question asked to every couple. And the answer is usually some bubbly, lovey dovey tale of being struck in the bum by Cupid’s arrow.  My meet cute (well not so meet cute) is slightly different. I was trolling a wealthy neighborhood in Beverly Hills, searching for someone to take me as their bride, you know, to make my arch nemesis jealous who consequently just fired me.  He was stomping around the block like some sort of gorgeous ogre, mumbling about a business deal gone wrong and attempting to finagle his way out of it.  And that's when we bumped into each other. There were no sparks. Not even a hint of blossoming love.  But next thing I knew, I was scarfing down free chips and guac, listening to this man lay out all of his problems which led to his big ask . . . he wanted me to be his Vivian Ward, you know, from Pretty Woman--minus the frisky behavior.  We're talking about living in a mansion, intimate double dates, and pretending we were head over heels in love . . . and engaged. Can you imagine? The absolute audacity. But people do crazy things when they’re desperate. And I reeked of desperation. So, I struck up a deal. My one big mistake, though . . . big . . . HUGE? I accidentally fell for the incomparable Huxley Cane.

I\'ve been reading romances for years but for some reason, had never read any of her books. The first book was ""The Strike Out"" and now this one, which in my opinion was marginally better than the first one. I am going to give her one more try to see if I\'ve just landed on some of her mediocre offerings because there is potential here. I\'m going to give the author the benefit of the doubt here because I\'m not sure if as a woman in her forties , I am her key demographic. I am finding a common theme with a lot of romance authors when writing their female characters. I get that their intention is to present a strong female with a kick ass attitude that doesn\'t take any guff from anyone. I like strong women being portrayed...but very few of them get the balance right between strong and vulnerable so a lot of these heroines end up coming across as immature, melodramatic harpies. In both of the books I read, her female characters tended more towards the latter. It is a fine line to walk and the authors that get it right, create strong beautiful heroines that you remember for a long time afterwards. The characters we\'ve met in Meghan\'s two books don\'t achieve the right mix and end up coming across as borderline unlikable, arrogant drama queens. I also found that both books were really hard to get into and the ""Meet-Cute"" moments weren\'t cute or believable. They got better as they went on and I was glad I hung on to the end of this one...to be honest though..if I had stopped where I first wanted to..I never would have tried another Meghan Quinn book. Short story long..there\'s potential but there are a lot of rough edges to work out when it comes to character development. I would love it if anyone here could recommend a MQ book that you loved because I would like to try one more...\n\n', '\n\n  I was hesitant to read this book after reading all the accolades on TikTok.  With most reviews, I hope I am hearing an honest perspective and not some false praise just for a social media post.“A Not So Meet Cute” did hit the nail on the head.  From the characters (main and secondary) to the storyline - it was a hit for me.I really enjoyed the banter of this book and the spice from “Chef’s Kiss”.I would recommend this book to read.  Not because thousands of others have read and remarked on it, but that it was a great story.\n\n', ""\n\n  4.5! Great read! First half was full of hilarious parts -especially the internal dialogue -  that made me laugh until my stomach hurt. I have to say that I think everyone was very unfair to Lottie though and not taking her feelings into consideration or her side in some instances that they should've which honestly irritated me a lot. It was an insane plot which was a fun spin on things but the moments they landed into made it worth the crazy. So funny and bonus for the Pretty Woman undertone!

  The most important fact about the coronavirus pandemic that turned the world upside down in 2020 is that our response to it has been an epic overreaction driven by a disastrous confluence of public and private interests—all of them purporting to “follow the science.”  Since the lockdowns began, millions of Americans have relied on the reporting of Alex Berenson. Exposing the hysteria and manipulation behind the worst failure of public policy since World War I, this clear-eyed journalist has been a critical source of reason and truth.  The product of relentless investigation and research, Pandemia explains how an illness that many people will never even know they had became the occasion for economically ruinous lockdowns and the suppression of personal freedom on a previously unimaginable scale. Dispassionate, factual, and untainted by any agenda other than telling the truth, this is the account that pandemic-weary Americans desperately need.

The book surpasses my expectations. I am familiar with the history of Covid 19 and the public response our political leaders and their medical advisors have forced on us. I am also an individual that has strongly disagreed with what has taken place in that, from the start the citizens  have never been treated as having the ability think objectively about their own well-being. Every thing that has been done has been mandated and human freedom discarded. This book recognizes what has happened and the author fully understands the dire consequences of relinquishing our freedom will have on a stable, prosperous society. A dictatorship, even one that professes to be benevolently concern with public health spells disaster.Can we re-establish a society that seeks informed consent, a society that strives to persuade rather than dictate public affairs? Can we recognize that our future does depend on our willingness to fight to reclaim a freedom lost because we panicked? Mr Berenson has laid out the case ...I urge everyone to take his words seriously.\n\n"", '\n\n  Well written and meticulously researched with 60 pages of references.

He’s been a trusted voice of reason in these trying times.Alex backs up his work with concrete data published from globally respected and publicly available sources of scientific evidence. There hasn’t been ONE source out there that has been able to discredit him, because he is relentlessly honest and meticulous in his work. Although they do try… When a reporter of this caliber gets booted off Twitter for speaking the truth, we should pay attention.I’m thankful for Alex and the very few other courageous truth tellers out there who truly follow the science, because they’ve kept me sane in these insane times.No matter which camp you’re on in terms of your medical decisions or whether you necessarily agree with all that is written in this book, it is brimming with the very best investigative journalism out there and is a MUST read. Or listen. I have both the hard copy and audio book!Congratulations Alex, on this great body of work!\n\n', '\n\n  Alex Berenson is truly dedicated to educating the world on the facts.  His opposition are enraged that he would dare to be honest and unbiased - something they have been unable to do.  I am only a few chapters into the book but, already at this point, things are falling into place.  I will have no trouble sharing this with those who have been entrenched in all the fear that our governments have shoved down our throats.  Not as an “I told you so” offer, but as “this is something very interesting most of us never knew”.  As a Canadian, I can see how influential US policies are on us eventually as we will follow suit sooner or later.  Thank you Mr. Berenson for your fortitude in pressing forward with this book!\n\n', '\n\n  Really simple. This book was written by an actual journalist. He 1) investigates, 2) uses his brain to make sense of what he finds out and 3) writes it down. Not many people using this method these days. Get your head out of the propaganda before it is too late.\n\n', '\n\n  Audio book was awesome. The written word will be just as good.\n\n', '\n\n  I loved the book, gave it a five star rating, and have repurchased it as a gift already. Since other reviews likely go into the pros to a great extent, I\'m going to list two cons I found a bit annoying. They don\'t detract from my recommendation of this important book, but just to let you know they are there.First, governments around the world continue to double down on invasive and rights-infringing strategies focused on scapegoating and discrimination (strategies which also clearly do not work), the subject of the vaccines is of great importance. I was a bit frustrated to learn that a bit of the content there was in the form of excerpts from Alex\'s previously released booklet on the subject. I suppose I would have liked to have seen those (short) booklet excerpts re-written at least to make me feel like I was buying something new. (Part of my frustration about the vaccines section, too, is inherent to the problem of releasing a book about current events: time marches on. By the time this book went to press, quite a bit of new information was already available and more continues to pop up every day. Hopefully Alex will follow up with a second book specifically on this topic.)Second, Alex has the endearing quality of wanting to be accepted and liked by as many soi-disant intelligent people as possible, despite the fact that many of such people are as far from reasonable as you can imagine, and will refuse to like him anyway. This desire to be accepted tends to crop up in passages about Alex\'s Twitter ban as well anything related to the most recent former US president if you know who I mean. In the former case, you can really tell how desperately he wants to get back on Twitter. (Let it go, Alex, that place is a desolate wasteland of everything that is wrong with humanity and the internet.) In the latter case, I personally find it grating that even reasonable people like Alex can\'t give that former president credit for anything whatsoever without first talking about what a terrible person he is. Maybe that\'s the world in which we live, but for me personally I find the constant stream of ""45 actually was right in this one instance but it\'s his fault nobody listened because of muh mean Tweets and so don\'t you get to thinking I like the guy"" a bit grating and off-putting.So those are my cons, and they don\'t outweigh the pros. Amazing book, buy it for yourself and your friends.\n\n', '\n\n  The first chapter sums up the government and civilian response to Covid: Extreme. Over. Reaction.A must read to understand how we got to this point.Team Reality needs to get a copy onto every desk in the CDC, FDA, NIAID, state and provincial health authorities.And then, into the hands of friends, family and neighbours.The spell of Covid must be broken and this will do it.\n\n']"

  I’m a Gemini. Impulsive. Curious. Headstrong. A twin. Heir to a throne I know nothing about. And it turns out, I’m Fae. But of course there’s a catch - all I have to do to claim my birth right is prove that I’m the most powerful supernatural in the whole of Solaria. And sure, technically that’s true as I’m the daughter of the Savage King. But the bit they didn’t put in the brochure was that every single Fae in this Kingdom would claim my throne if they could. The school they’ve sent me to is both dangerous as sh*t and one helluva party. Vampires bite weaker students in the corridors, the Werewolf pack has orgies in the Wailing Wood at every full moon and don’t even get me started on the dark and twisted ways the Sirens use their powers on people’s emotions, or how my sinfully tempting Cardinal Magic teacher hosts detentions that leave people needing therapy. Classes are totally interesting if you manage to live through them. And that Gemini star sign I mentioned? It now determines my elemental magic and affects my destiny, so learning astrology is essential if I’m going to beat down my classmates – which is actively encouraged by the way. My biggest problem is the drool worthy Dragon shifter who has his eyes on my throne. He and his three psycho friends are determined to make my time here hell. All I’ve got to do is survive. But fate might have other ideas. Dammit, why couldn’t I have gotten a letter to Hogwarts? ***This is a dark, bully romance – don’t go expecting a sweet school for magic with friends around every corner. Fae fight for everything they own and Zodiac Academy is a cutthroat school for students aged 18+ where only the strongest prevail. There’s no Dumbledore here to save anyone’s ass and Lionel Acrux will give Voldemort a run for his money in the evil dictator category.

  The national–bestselling biography on the country singer and songwriter known as “The Man in Black.”In this, the definitive biography of an American legend, Robert Hilburn conveys the unvarnished truth about a musical superstar. Johnny Cash’s extraordinary career stretched from his days at Sun Records with Elvis Presley and Jerry Lee Lewis to the remarkable creative last hurrah, at age 69, that resulted in the brave, moving “Hurt” video.As music critic for the Los Angeles Times, Hilburn knew Cash throughout his life: he was the only music journalist at the legendary Folsom Prison concert in 1968, and he interviewed both Cash and his wife June Carter just months before their deaths. Drawing upon a trove of never-before-seen material from the singer’s inner circle, Hilburn creates an utterly compelling, deeply human portrait of a towering figure in country music, a seminal influence in rock, and an icon of American popular culture. Hilburn's reporting shows the astonishing highs and deep lows that marked the journey of a man of great faith and humbling addiction who throughout his life strove to use his music to lift people's spirits.“Hilburn has written a brilliant story of an even more brilliant songwriter, warts and all.” —Keith Richards“The ultimate Johnny Cash biography . . . Rock writer great Robert Hilburn goes deep.” —Rolling Stone“Veteran music writer Hilburn . . . masterfully separates fiction from fact in an exhaustive, but never exhausting, biography of the legendary musician...The personal knowledge aided by extensive archival research and always compelling, accessible writing makes this an instant-classic music biography with something to offer all generations of listeners.” —Kirkus Reviews (starred review)  Read more  ","['5.0 out of 5 stars', '5.0 out of 5 stars', '5.0 out of 5 stars', '3.0 out of 5 stars', '5.0 out of 5 stars', '5.0 out of 5 stars', '3.0 out of 5 stars', '5.0 out of 5 stars']","['\nA great bio maybe the best on Cash\n', '\nThe book should be called, Living Death\n', '\nA Look in to the Life of a Legend\n', '\nMore Than I Wanted to Know\n', '\nA realistic portrayal of a famous life\n', '\nFive Stars\n', '\nwas okay\n', '\nFive Stars\n']","['\n\n  I read this book after hearing about it on a radio show about new releases. The book is an in depth bio of the life of Johnny Cash, the good, the bad, the ugly, no details are spared. He was a great songwriter and artist but he was also very human and had many faults though he was always trying to make amends. Much loved by his family and many children, he made mistakes, used drugs all his life and there was lots of booze and many, many women. In the end you cannot but feel closer to him and realize that all great artistic icons have their very human frailties. A beautiful book and I now understand why he is still selling records 11 years after his death.\n\n', '\n\n  From the start of the book, it was very up-beat. How J.R. grew up and broke through in to the music field.His early days with Sun and Sam Phillips are carefully detailed; almost like a ""You are There"" documentary. The start of the downfall , and the consequences are blamed on drugs; his marriage blamed on days on the road .Everytime the author builds us up, Johnny lets us down.Friends and producers, band members come and go like so many names. The marriage to June Carter is looked upon as a ""life preserver"", as is the birth of John Carter.Again our hopes are raised only to be dashed upon the rocks. The Man in Black was adeath image; always  bobbing to the top of a foaming storm, then sinking again.If the perils and troubles of Cash are not true, they would be hard to believe. His Christian outlook on life, and his constant hope for redemption was the fuel of this great entertainer, and great man.A must read for anyone interested in behind the scenes of the record industry, and how one man coped, or didn\'t cope, with his life.\n\n', ""\n\n  An entertaining and insightful look into the life of one the world's most legendary songwriters and performers. As always, Robert Hilburn doesn't disappoint. His well-researched material and ability to easily narrate a story make him one of North America's most respected music writers.  He knows his subject well, and was the only member of the press allowed to accompany Cash to Folsom, site of one of the most legendary of Cash's performances\n\n"", '\n\n  A very well written and well researched biography. Brutally honest. Sometimes difficult to read. I have always been a Cash fan, saw him probably 15 times in concert. I would just as soon not know all of his story, for his actions and lifestyle very much lowers him in my estimation. He was a religious hypocrite, claiming to be a godly man, while being a raging drug addict virtually his whole life. He had the nerve to preach to other people, while his addiction brought misery to almost everyone he came In contact with.\n\n', '\n\n  For those who recognize that Johnny Cash was a complicated multidimensional man and are not afraid to see the seedier side with the good, it is a well-written portrayal. It does not sensationalize\n\n', '\n\n  Great Stuff !!\n\n', '\n\n  Was a good read. Was a little long  in some  about other people and could have used more photos.

That’s like if I ever wrote a book about a murder mystery or something and had a character wearing a red crop top with their belly hanging out and I started marketing it as a retelling of Winnie the Pooh.

  NEW YORK TIMES BESTSELLER “If you’re looking for a book to take on holiday this summer, The Seven Husbands of Evelyn Hugo has got all the glitz and glamour to make it a perfect beach read.” —Bustle From the New York Times bestselling author of Daisy Jones & the Six—an entrancing and “wildly addictive journey of a reclusive Hollywood starlet” (PopSugar) as she reflects on her relentless rise to the top and the risks she took, the loves she lost, and the long-held secrets the public could never imagine.Aging and reclusive Hollywood movie icon Evelyn Hugo is finally ready to tell the truth about her glamorous and scandalous life. But when she chooses unknown magazine reporter Monique Grant for the job, no one is more astounded than Monique herself. Why her? Why now? Monique is not exactly on top of the world. Her husband has left her, and her professional life is going nowhere. Regardless of why Evelyn has selected her to write her biography, Monique is determined to use this opportunity to jumpstart her career. Summoned to Evelyn’s luxurious apartment, Monique listens in fascination as the actress tells her story. From making her way to Los Angeles in the 1950s to her decision to leave show business in the ‘80s, and, of course, the seven husbands along the way, Evelyn unspools a tale of ruthless ambition, unexpected friendship, and a great forbidden love. Monique begins to feel a very real connection to the legendary star, but as Evelyn’s story near its conclusion, it becomes clear that her life intersects with Monique’s own in tragic and irreversible ways. “Heartbreaking, yet beautiful” (Jamie Blynn, Us Weekly), The Seven Husbands of Evelyn Hugo is “Tinseltown drama at its finest” (Redbook): a mesmerizing journey through the splendor of old Hollywood into the harsh realities of the present day as two women struggle with what it means—and what it costs—to face the truth.

It isn\'t as ""fluffy"" as you think of when you think of a great beach read, but I would have loved to read this book while laying out on a beach somewhere.

Does anyone need to be essentially lectured to about this while they are reading a fluffy book at the beach?\n\n', '\n\n  This book is very popular for a reason.

I started reading it in the middle of finals week and it was a terrible mistake because suddenly I could not focus on anything until I finished it. I even read it during my breaks at work. It is marvelous, a beautiful love story that I needed, but mostly a character so flawed that she became perfect for me. Evelyn is by far the most interesting, well-crafted character I have had the pleasure of reading. I loved every single page, cried and laughed and cried a lot more. I cannot wait to re-read it over and over, for I simply missed her the moment I turned the last page.Please, please indulge into this purchase. You won't regret it\n\n"", '\n\n  I really enjoyed reading this book. There is a suspense hanging in the air throughout the read, but the ending was still a surprise. This is a perfect beach read.

Actually asking because I think that I’ve gone from like “likes her books” to absolutely obsessed and I’m in awe.Now to start on Window Shopping itself instead of fan-girling over Tessa Bailey for another 500 words. Conceptually, this book had me hooked. If you love grumpy/sunshine, this reverse grumpy/sunshine is like the crème de la crème, Aiden is pure bow-tie wearing sunshine, Aiden is the spirit of Christmas itself, Aiden is the present I want under my Christmas tree this year. In contrast, Stella is brooding and dark and she has a deep, tragic backstory and it just all works together to make them the perfect grumpy/sunshine pair!!Now if you don’t want any spoilers, quit here, turn back! Last warning!Watching Aiden transform from this bow-tie wearing, wholesome, rule-following dork to an absolute dirty-talking, possessive, protective HUNK without giving up any of the innate goodness of himself was honestly my favourite part of this book. I also loved that Stella didn’t just become this ray of sunshine, she still had her difficulties, she still had her background, she still had to work through her own issues and a man didn’t just up and solve that for her! However, their relationship is so meaningful and passionate and perfect. You know when you’re working on a puzzle and you look at a piece that doesn’t seem like its going to fit and then lo and behold that’s the piece! And then it’s so obvious, of course that was the piece, how did I not see that?? That’s Aiden and Stella.PLUS, in between being absolutely HOT and also so wholesome (because Aiden is Aiden of COURSE), this book was so funny. When Stella catches Aiden getting drunk in the store after hours??? Their banter is incredible and so funny.

This story was so unique and fun! I was honestly hooked from the opening chapter. It's definitely an insta-love romance, but it worked for me.Set within an upscale department store, Stella has dreamed of becoming a window dresser ... and she now has her chance. Despite her prison record and the giant gap in her employment, general manager Aiden hires her to style the window for the upcoming Christmas season at Vivant.Not wanting to jeopardize her opportunity with a relationship, I loved the tension created in this workplace romance. Prepare yourself for some intense heat. Wowza!Stella was a true grump with a tender heart, simply trying to find her footing after a four-year sentence. And Aiden was so selfless. I loved his nonjudgmental personality, immediately welcoming Stella into his life. Perfectly festive—I simply adored these two together!\n\n"", ""\n\n  Tessa Bailey has yet to disappoint. This beautifully written novel is absolutely perfect for a cold winter Sunday, accompanied by hot chocolate, of course.Stella and Aiden are a wonderful pair.

I thought it was a bit ridiculous how the two main characters immediately fell for each other in such a love struck way, the boss/employee dynamic made my stomach turn… not a fan. Lots of awesome reviews so maybe it’s just me being a pessimist!\n\n', ""\n\n  This was my first book from Tessa Bailey and boy did she not disappoint! The intricate writing, the romance that holds you by the guts, and the humor that is just perfectly dosed not to be cheesy and for you to connect even more with the characters. This grumpy sushine romance with the man being the sunshine was everything I didn't know I needed. Tessa Bailey is now a trusted author from whom I will not hesitate to buy more books. I loved the male main character's humor, and the duality in his personnality where he has a sunshine personnality and also a very intense side. He can be very intense, in a calm and sweet way, and other times in a very hot and sexy way. Seriously, don't be fooled by the cartoony cover, this is hot hot hot and steamy. But there is more to the smutt, because it is written with so much feelings and depth that it makes the tension and angst even better. I also adore how the male character is turned on by romance and intimacy. If you were hesitating, stop right now and go buy this. It's worth it for every reasons you're thinking, and more.\n\n"", '\n\n  What a treat this book was!

  The Instant New York Times Bestseller!As seen on THE VIEW!A BuzzFeed Best Summer Read of 2021 When a fake relationship between scientists meets the irresistible force of attraction, it throws one woman's carefully calculated theories on love into chaos.As a third-year Ph.D. candidate, Olive Smith doesn't believe in lasting romantic relationships--but her best friend does, and that's what got her into this situation. Convincing Anh that Olive is dating and well on her way to a happily ever after was always going to take more than hand-wavy Jedi mind tricks: Scientists require proof. So, like any self-respecting biologist, Olive panics and kisses the first man she sees.That man is none other than Adam Carlsen, a young hotshot professor--and well-known ass. Which is why Olive is positively floored when Stanford's reigning lab tyrant agrees to keep her charade a secret and be her fake boyfriend. But when a big science conference goes haywire, putting Olive's career on the Bunsen burner, Adam surprises her again with his unyielding support and even more unyielding...six-pack abs.Suddenly their little experiment feels dangerously close to combustion. And Olive discovers that the only thing more complicated than a hypothesis on love is putting her own heart under the microscope.

It was well written, though after a while, tbh, I did find the heroine's lying and lying for the sake of others tiresome.  Ok, at one point I wanted to take a hammer to my reader.  Same with the sex scene, it was lovely, nice that consent was made obvious, but the stop, start, stop, oh wait, stop, but...Adam? was laid on a bit thick and I was tempted to throw said reader.  But aside from that, I still found it very enjoyable and fun to read, and it kept my interest, so that was the main thing.  Thanks for a good read.  Five stars. :)\n\n"", ""\n\n  This book was heavily recommended in my reader group. I'm always nervous about books with cartoon covers.I absolutely loved this book! Ali managed to top all other fake dating trope romance novels out there. This book was hilarious. The writing was entertaining while informative. The dialogue was really fast and smart. The back and forth banter reminds me of Gilmore Girls.Nothing bad to say what so ever about this book. Amazing. Definitely lives up to all the hype.\n\n"", ""\n\n  This novel deserves every bit of the praise that it’s been receiving. As soon as I began reading The Love Hypothesis, I knew that I had found a gem. This is a fabulous debut that, after finishing it, had me wanting to go back to page one and read it all over again.I adored Olive right from the very beginning. She’s intelligent, sweet, loyal, and quirky. I wanted to be her friend! When she needed to convince her friend that she was dating someone new (which she wasn’t), she grabbed the first guy that she came across in the hallway of her department. Lo and behold, she ended up kissing a highly revered, unapproachable, and feared professor. Yes!Dr. Carlsen was everything that I wanted in a grumpy, scholarly, unfriendly character. With his uptight, rigid personality and Olive’s awkward, witty charm, these two were pure gold.As a fan of slow-burning romances, this one was perfection. I felt Olive and Adam’s attraction from the get-go, but the author took her time to build their connection and, in turn, built up my anticipation. There’s nothing better than falling in love right alongside the characters, and that’s just what I did. From the butterflies in my stomach to the pins and needles of anticipation, this book put me in my happy place.I honestly loved everything about The Love Hypothesis. It was filled with humor, heart, romance, wonderful characters, and clever writing. If you've already read this book, you know what I'm talking about, but if you haven't read it yet, do yourself a favor and read it! I promise that you won't be disappointed.This is one of the best books that I’ve read this year!\n\n"", '\n\n  “I wish you could see yourself the way I see you.”What You’ll Find:✔️Quirky Romance✔️Fake Relationship✔️Heroine in STEM✔️Broody Hero✔️Single POVMINI REVIEWThis one has been hyped all over bookstagram. So I gave in, it sounded cute, and buddy read it with some lovelies. But for me, it didn’t quite live up to the hype. Hear me out, it’s a sweet read, and I did enjoy it. It just had a slow start for me, feeling younger than I expected. And the chapters are LONG y’all, and felt that much longer in the beginning. The second half is where it really drew me in, and I felt as though I got through the chapters much quicker!I was sure this was a closed door romance. I just didn’t feel the tension or chemistry others seemed to feel. And I NEED to feel that. It goes from fake kissing and holding hands, to an abrupt flip to FULL steam ahead! There was no real build up. Not that I think every romance needs steam, but the steam in this one is ultimately what helped me feel their romance and connection finally. In the end, a cute read. And a solid debut, with what I think will result in promising stories to come from this author.\n\n', '\n\n  Boy, did this book ever live up to the hype! I absolutely LOVED it! It was so refreshing to read a rom-com set in academia. I loved all the academic references, from getting excited about lit searches to mentions of predatory journal emails (LOL do we ever get a lot of those!). I also loved that the heroine was Canadian (The jokes about the metric system killed me, though I’ve never heard of people eating moose heart. It hurts <i>my</i> heart to think of doing that to such a majestic creature 😩)I love both the heroine and the hero in this book so much. The heroine is relatable, and not just because she’s a female scientist (I’m not a scientist, but my first two degrees were in the sciences). I am a huge fan of the grumpy/sunshine trope, and while this book doesn’t quite fit that mold, I love how curmudgeonly Adam is. The entire book is told through Olive’s point of view, and I enjoyed how, as a reader, I could still infer what Adam was thinking the entire time.While the plot is quite predictable, I didn’t care one iota. I freaking loved every single page!5 million stars!\n\n']"

I will try to avoid spoilers because the book takes a lot of twists.The book isn’t so much a novel as a series of vignettes, half of them going through the years prior to the opening scene.  The second half, interleaved with the first, are the chronicles of the protagonist, going on from that first scene.  For those familiar with The Martian, we again see the universe, and Murphy, working together to present endless challenges which our hero defeats (for the most part) with the diligent application of Science.  The book is wrtten almost entirely  in the first person.  Each of the scenes are easy reads, and many I read multiple times, because they’re fun!  (Court battle.)While this format is distracting it is entertaining.  It probably slowed my reading down, which could be good or bad.The author uses foreshadowing ... alot.  At least half the twists i saw coming.  Between that, and Murphy, you knew when things were going well, it was going to crash.But it was STILL an easy and very entertaining book.\n\n', ""\n\n  Having read The Martian and seen the movie, I was anxious and excited to read Project Hail Mary. First, let me explore some of the problems causing mixed reviews. It is very heavy on science and technology. I thought the explanations by Andy Weir were difficult to follow for anyone without a strong background in mathematics, physics, chemistry or astronomy. Still, the author did this as well as possible. I found I did not need to fully follow the explanations to be along on the wild ride through space. It was sufficient to read about the actions, danger, and problems faced. I found the story so exciting and thought-provoking that it was enough for me to follow what was happening and be captivated by the suspense and tension without understanding the scientific theories involved. I imagine that readers with a strong background in science or math might enjoy fact-checking the accuracy of the explanations, but this is not necessary to believe this thrilling story. The earth is facing annihilation in the not-too-distant future. Alien microorganisms, astrophages, are absorbing energy from the sun. The sun is cooling, and it is predicted that this will lead to an ice age, famines, wars for resources, and the eventual extinction of most of the life on earth. There seems to be a glimmer of hope on a planet, Tau Ceti, in a distant solar system. This is the only place discovered where astrophages are being destroyed. The Petrova task force has been set up consisting of the worlds' greatest minds from many nations. They establish Project Hail Mary under the leadership and authority of the director (dictator) Eva Stratt. She is driven to save the world from impending catastrophe at all costs. What she possesses in authority puts her on a power trip. She is cold-hearted, lacks scruples and willing to set aside legalities, morality and ethics to achieve her goals. She will select a three-person crew of the best scientists and astronauts capable of withstanding a prolonged coma on their long one-way suicide journey into interstellar space. Sometime in the future, aboard the spaceship Hail Mary, Ryland Grace awakens from an induced coma. Tubes, electrodes and IV lines are attached to his body. Nearby are the mummified bodies of his two crewmates. He cannot recall his name, where he is, or why he is there. As his physical body gains strength, he recovers snippets of memory of the past.He was a dedicated, enthusiastic, and popular Junior High science teacher whose work was inspiring to his students. He had few friends.  How did he come to be selected for this mission, and for what purpose?  He is horrified to learn he is somewhere in deep space with no way back to earth.  He knows he doesn't want to die, but there is no way home with insufficient food and fuel. His two crewmates could have explained the mission and helped him, but they are dead. He realizes this will soon be his solitary fate. As bits of his memory and thoughts begin to clarify, we learn more about his life and how he got to be on this mission into outer space. If only he could remember what he is supposed to do now! He makes contact with a masterful engineer and mechanic named Rocky. To say more about this endearing and wonderful character would be a spoiler.  Ryland Grace has a snide, witty, and sarcastic sense of humour, usually directed at himself. It is a wild, exciting journey towards his destination, Tau Ceti. The ride is full of danger, twists and excitement. Through his tireless ingenuity, he manages to overcome obstacles never before faced by anyone. Does Grace muddle through and save the earth?  What difficult choice must now face him?  Of all the endings I could envision, I never thought of its fantastical conclusion which was most unexpected and satisfying for me.\n\n"", '\n\n  As I got into Andy Weir\'s latest, early on I decided on four stars as the first person narrative was very close in style to Mark Watney in ""The Martian""  I almost expected the character to be revealed as him!  But in the end, this was such a fun, creative yarn that it gets the full five stars from me!  Great premise, great science, great ......... (avoiding spoiler).  In my eyes, the author is formally redeemed from ""Artemis"".  Looking forward to the next - seems open to a sequel!\n\n', '\n\n  Amazing!... or as Rocky would say, ""Amaze! Amaze! Amaze!""I was a huge fan of The Martian. I especially liked how Andy Weir ""did the math"" in that story to describe technical problems and their solutions. Even though I\'m terrible at math and it was my worst subject in school, the author makes it so approachable and interesting. So when I learned that Andy Weir had written an interstellar, alien first-contact novel, I was concerned that he would focus on the dramatic and get less into the guts of individual problems and the details of their solutions. I am pleased to say that my concerns were unfounded.The story is compelling from start to finish and, although it includes the techie stuff that I like, character development was superb, the drama was intense, and the emotional aspects of the story were compelling.Overall, Project Hail Mary is the best book that I have read this year, and possibly ever!\n\n', '\n\n  I read this book in 2 days which is rare for me. I couldn’t put it down.It is a fun and fast moving book. There is a fair amount of science and technical jargon but not enough to put off the average reader.It is a well told story and even though it isn’t the Martian, it is a very worthwhile read.\n\n', '\n\n  I have become an Andy Weir fan, on the basis of his earlier books, *The Martian* and *Artemis,* and I didn\'t know what to expect with his latest book. The title didn\'t particularly ""grab"" me. But immediately upon opening it, I was hooked. The protagonist, who tells the story in the first person, wakes up in an unknown environment, with only two corpses and a set of mechanical arms for company, and he has no idea where he is, or even his name and identity. So the story begins with the hero\'s first experiments to uncover his whereabouts, and short flashbacks as he begins to remember bits and pieces of his past history. That may sound a bit off-putting - it shouldn\'t be! Weir is a rivetting writer, and he includes much dry humor, and the book is not just a solo journey for long - I will say no more! MOST highly recommended!\n\n', '\n\n  Familiar Weir first person perspective tells a story of another reluctant hero with an unusual sidekick named Rocky. They help each other and work together to save their people. Mostly this is a funny, engaging story of two aliens forging a friendship. Exciting and hilarious, this is well worth the read for any nerdy science geek but also anyone who has ever dreamed of space travel.\n\n']"

At this point, I sound like a broken record, but it NEEDS to be made abundantly clear that Lark is one of the most talented romance authors of our time.While Lark started with mafia romance and succeeded in writing exceptional books, such as The Spy and Brutal Prince, this new endeavour only serves to prove her literary prowess.Serial killer romance books are notoriously difficult to execute, and especially difficult to execute well. The author has to dance on the fine line between love and hate, moreso than any enemies-to-lovers requires. The killer must be ruthless enough to despise but human enough to understand, and ultimately fall for.Cole Blackwell is one of the best examples of this that I've ever seen. The way his chapters prove his moral compass, or lack thereof, is mesmerizing. The way he easily admits that he hasn't killed a woman, not because it goes against a moral code, but because none have made it worth his time, is one of the my favourite parts about Cole.Lark has several fantastic skills. Building universes, developing morally grey characters (and ensuring the reader can love them), writing smut that leaves the reader breathless, and, of course, the spectacular narration style that is so uniquely LARK. My only qualm with this book, and the reason it's not a 5/5, is the plot. I think Lark could have done better because I've read so many of her other books where she DOES so much better. There Are No Saints set the bar high, and while There Is No Devil meets some of the expectations set, its story falls a little flat after the tidal wave of the first book.I would have loved to see more interaction between Shaw and our MCs. I think after so much buildup, it was a bit cruel to not have Shaw be more present in this book. I kept waiting for Lark to wow me with the story, similar to how she's done in the past with Kingmakers and Brutal Birthright, but instead I found myself disappointed.Perhaps I'm being a bit harsh, after all, this is a romance novel and the cardinal rule of this genre is that there must be a guaranteed HEA. BUT, I wanted Lark to push the boundaries. I wanted an ending that shocked me. I wanted to be taken aback by the plot, enraptured to find out what happened next, like I was with the first book, but that was not what happened.I think that this book is sort of like the calm after the storm. The hurricane that was the first book may have influenced my mind into thinking that the inclement weather would last forever.Mara and Cole are layered, complex, phenomenal characters. Mara's sensory issues, which I heavily relate to, heighten the efficacy of the delivery when Lark is describing the various sensations Mara feels. Cole's drive to constantly push Mara to be the star he knows she can be is beautifully written. At a glance, these characters are flawed and could be considered broken, but as we explore the depths of their minds, we find that they are only bent, waiting for the other to right them.Lark does another thing extremely well, and that is making the reader feel immersed in the setting. Her apt descriptions of places, people, decorations, rooms, and so on, are brilliantly done. As with every Lark book, this one played like a movie in my mind, and I've never even been to California.Overall, this is a superb duet. I recommend it and I hope to see Lark continue to expand the range of her works.\n\n"", ""\n\n  This is the brilliant conclusion to this masterpiece bathed in darkness and light, joy and pain, love and hate. And since one doesn't exist without the other, so does Cole need Mara. This is an interesting, fast-paced, and incredibly steamy conclusion  that will absolutely etch Cole and Mara as favorite characters in our memories forever.\n\n"", ""\n\n  This is one enthralling read that captivated me in the first book and blew me with this finale. On the surface this seems a serial killer book but is so much deeper. The beautiful descriptions of Mara's childhood as told in art were incredible.  The relationship that grows between Cole and Mara was compelling. Incredible read.\n\n"", '\n\n  A duet requires two whether it is two books or two characters. As usual Sophie does not disappoint. The changes that Cole and Mara go through are pivotal to the story and provide the pinnacle transformation needed to keep us on the edge. Another extremely  satisfying offering by the creative and talented Sophie Lark.\n\n', '\n\n  *SPOILERS* OMG. First off this series is dark and twisted and may not be for all readers. That being said I loved it. Cole and Mara are this awesome couple who are twisted in their revenge on those who hurt them. They are 2 soul halves that complete eachother. Sophie Lark keep up the amazing work!\n\n', '\n\n  I honestly did not expect to enjoy this book. Way out of the norm for me. However, it was this perfect blend of philosophy and soulmates. I’m off to read more from this author to make sure this duet wasn’t a fluke.  Going in with much more excitement and expectation this time around. ❤️\n\n', '\n\n  Cole and Mara were each the missing piece the other needed.  The crazy to the others storm. I loved how they settled the trouble within the other and everything made perfect sense.  Loved their story.\n\n', '\n\n  Sophie Lark has done it again. She has created two characters that seem nothing alike but share a deeper connection. You can’t help but fall in love with their journey! A must read series!!\n\n']"

Turns out, the answer is, A LOT! And all in a good way! I absolutely LOVED this book. It is bolder, darker, sexier and taps into the lore and mythology way more. The gods play pivotal roles and each one has a distinct personality. I couldn't get enough!Seeing the darkness in Hades, his skewed moral compass and the secrets he has and continues to keep from Persephone make him a far more layered character. He isn't just a sex, brooding god, but a man with complex and uncertain emotions who will do anything for his lady. I loved his interactions with Hecate and Hermes, who have officially become my favourite side characters. There were new scenes added to familiar ones, which amplified the steam ten fold.The plot has so much going on, so many unique threads that change how scenes in ATOD unfolded. I thought it was cleverly done and it was a joy to read. The banter and chemistry between the two leads was fantastic and they are becoming one of my favourite bookish couples. There were also side plots and threads left open for future books, and I can't wait to see how they tie together.A Game of Fate is perfect for anyone who loves new, urban takes on mythology and legends, super steamy fated romance, and morally grey heroes who keep their secrets close to their hearts. I can't wait to see what happens next!\n\n"", ""\n\n  Well, ohh my flippin glorious gods!!!! This is Hades' POV but it is so much more than that. Once you've read Touch of darkness, Touch of Ruin, and Touch of Malice, PLEASE PLEASE read this book! I need the rest of the books, like now 😫Ughhhh...... his thoughts, his intentions, his fears, it gives you so much more than that, and man do I love him even more than I did in the Persephone's POV. You also get to see other sides of the supporting characters interactions with Hades, and just wow..... I laughed SO much in this book and ahh... the butterflies I got, there was a couple times where I also squealed like a school girl because of them, no joke.I love how you can see his sense of humour more so in this book and its just so hot! Soo hot.......You get to see how he runs his Underworld and how he feels about his Upperworld  ventures. Very cool book if you ask me, I really enjoyed it. Cant wait for the rest of the books. They can't come fast enough. I will definitely be reading more from this author!\n\n"", '\n\n  This is so much more then just his side, it’s an entire story unto it self. It’s Hades story, his truths, his darkness, strengths (weaknesses shhh 🤫 don’t tell him I told) and how he learned to open him self up and be vulnerable.Some pain is deep, some truths we hide from our selfs. He was  helping build Sephy‘a confidence and helping her to see her value and her strengths. While she was destroying the walls and repairing his heart. 🖤🔥🖤🔥\n\n', ""\n\n  This is a touch of Darkness retold from Hades pov. At first I was skeptical that it was just going to be a boring retelling of a story I've already read but I think I enjoyed it more than Persephones pov! Hades is complex and sexy and the added scenes really flesh out the whole love story. You get more insight to his motives. This book definitely did not fell like a rehash of an already published book. It was so much more and so fun to read! In love with this series and can't wait for more Hades and Persephone!\n\n"", '\n\n  I’m so glad that I read this book! I love the first two books of the series and in anticipation of the third book coming out in a few days, I thought I’d read this to get me back into the universe. This book made me love Hades even more! I also liked his storyline that we didn’t get to see in Persephone’s POV. Highly recommend!!!\n\n', '\n\n  For fans of ACOTAR & Crescent City, or TOG, to Cassandra Clare or Blood & Honey, this is for you. In the second instalment of Persephone x Hades, which is technically like book 1.5 - book one from Hades’ view - we get a back door feel to what was happening in his world. I am usually not a fan of this type of storyline, however I was elated to read on. The book covers main plot points from the first but really follows how they arrived at those points. Really well written to discover more about Hades.\n\n', '\n\n  Now this book is exactly what I have wanted since the first book. The writing was strong, the plot was great, and I loved reading the lengths Hades would go through to have and protect Persephone!\n\n', '\n\n  Excellent addition to the HXP story, this time from Hades perspective. I recommend reading in combination, or right before/after ATOD\n\n']"

  When paramedics find a malnourished six-year-old boy near a burning car that holds a dead woman, they wonder who he is—and why he won't speak. From the New York Times bestselling author of The Mountain Between Us comes a story of self-discovery, healing, and hope.On a stifling summer day, an old Chevy Impala ignored the warning signals and was annihilated by the oncoming train. What no one realized until much later was that the driver had paused just before entering the tracks and kicked a small boy out of the car. A small boy with broken glasses who is clutching a notebook with all his might . . . but who never speaks.Chase Walker was one of the lucky ones. He was in foster care as a child, but he finally ended up with a family who loved him and cared for him. Now, as a journalist for the local paper, he’s moved on and put the past behind him. But when he’s assigned the story of this young boy, painful, haunting questions about his own childhood begin to rise to the surface.And as Chase Walker discovers, learning the truth about who you are can be as elusive—and as magical—as chasing fireflies on a summer night.Praise for Chasing Fireflies:“Colorful, memorable characters; Southern regional flavor that’s drop-dead accurate; and lyrical, intelligent writing make Chasing Fireflies an exceptionally good read.” —Aspiring Retail“Martin understands the power of story and he uses it to alter the souls and lives of both his characters and his readers . . .”—Patti Callahan Henry, New York Times bestselling authorFull-length emotive Southern fictionIncludes discussion questions for book clubsBonus excerpt from Long Way GoneAlso by Charles Martin: The Water Keeper, The Mountain Between Us, Send Down the Rain, and When Crickets Cry  Read more  ","['5.0 out of 5 stars', '5.0 out of 5 stars', '4.0 out of 5 stars', '5.0 out of 5 stars', '5.0 out of 5 stars', '5.0 out of 5 stars', '5.0 out of 5 stars', '5.0 out of 5 stars']","['\nan exceptionally well written story\n', '\nGreat author\n', '\nAnother good read by a good author\n', '\nBeautifully written - good story\n', '\nA great read\n', '\nBrilliant\n', '\nFive Stars\n', '\nGerry S\n']","['\n\n  I read 3 novels every wk, and this is a standout book among the many dozens upon dozens I have read in recent years.

  When a pseudonymous programmer introduced “a new electronic cash system that’s fully peer-to-peer, with no trusted third party” to a small online mailing list in 2008, very few paid attention. Ten years later, and against all odds, this upstart autonomous decentralized software offers an unstoppable and globally-accessible hard money alternative to modern central banks. The Bitcoin Standard analyzes the historical context to the rise of Bitcoin, the economic properties that have allowed it to grow quickly, and its likely economic, political, and social implications. While Bitcoin is a new invention of the digital age, the problem it purports to solve is as old as human society itself: transferring value across time and space. Ammous takes the reader on an engaging journey through the history of technologies performing the functions of money, from primitive systems of trading limestones and seashells, to metals, coins, the gold standard, and modern government debt. Exploring what gave these technologies their monetary role, and how most lost it, provides the reader with a good idea of what makes for sound money, and sets the stage for an economic discussion of its consequences for individual and societal future-orientation, capital accumulation, trade, peace, culture, and art. Compellingly, Ammous shows that it is no coincidence that the loftiest achievements of humanity have come in societies enjoying the benefits of sound monetary regimes, nor is it coincidental that monetary collapse has usually accompanied civilizational collapse. With this background in place, the book moves on to explain the operation of Bitcoin in a functional and intuitive way. Bitcoin is a decentralized, distributed piece of software that converts electricity and processing power into indisputably accurate records, thus allowing its users to utilize the Internet to perform the traditional functions of money without having to rely on, or trust, any authorities or infrastructure in the physical world. Bitcoin is thus best understood as the first successfully implemented form of digital cash and digital hard money. With an automated and perfectly predictable monetary policy, and the ability to perform final settlement of large sums across the world in a matter of minutes, Bitcoin’s real competitive edge might just be as a store of value and network for final settlement of large payments—a digital form of gold with a built-in settlement infrastructure. Ammous’ firm grasp of the technological possibilities as well as the historical realities of monetary evolution provides for a fascinating exploration of the ramifications of voluntary free market money. As it challenges the most sacred of government monopolies, Bitcoin shifts the pendulum of sovereignty away from governments in favor of individuals, offering us the tantalizing possibility of a world where money is fully extricated from politics and unrestrained by borders. The final chapter of the book explores some of the most common questions surrounding Bitcoin: Is Bitcoin mining a waste of energy? Is Bitcoin for criminals? Who controls Bitcoin, and can they change it if they please? How can Bitcoin be killed? And what to make of all the thousands of Bitcoin knock-offs, and the many supposed applications of Bitcoin’s ‘blockchain technology’? The Bitcoin Standard is the essential resource for a clear understanding of the rise of the Internet’s decentralized, apolitical, free-market alternative to national central banks.

It has been for me.In this pragmatic coverage of monetary history and economics, the author, Saifedean Ammous, eloquently reveals what makes money, and why it matters for human societies.This book pierces through the opacity of the multi-decade fiat currency experiments held by many countries all around the world. Consuming this writing will most likely trigger you to question a core axiom about the current financial system: should nations be sovereign and control money? As you advance in the reading, you will come to realize that government-issued money is a historical outlier—a 90 years old societal anomaly. Bitcoin is introduced as what it is slowly becoming: the next global reserve currency and settlement network—free of governmental agents manipulating it.That book is the start of the Bitcoin rabbit hole for many, as it was for me. I highly recommend it to anyone who is interested to learn about the monetary evolution we are seeing unfold in front of us. Along this book, Bitcoin will most likely morph your thinking around economics, money, human societies, nutrition, art and many other things. All these subject matters may not seem related at the moment, but they are.Enough said. Enjoy!\n\n', '\n\n  I\'m only on chapter 8, where he finally gets to Bitcoin, but all the preceding chapters have been an eye opener. (I thought Keynes was supposed to be a bona fide economist; instead he seems to have been many other things, most of them unsavoury.)If you\'re of the Austrian School, you will love this book. Fascinating.I\'ll try to get back and update this when I\'m done.UPDATEFinished reading the book. The title of this review should now be Great book on money, BitCoin, and cryptocurrencies..The author cuts through so much of the enormous hype surrounding this technology, and the semi-mythical origns of BitCoin. He gives a clear, straightforward discussion of what makes bc special and its strengths and weaknesses (no it is NOT for buying lattes at Starbucks, regardless of how hip that might make you look; yes it makes an excellent digital store of value and could well become digital gold if it is not already that).He gives logical reasons for why no other alt coin so far can compete with bc or is likely to dethrone it.He does not enlighten us as to who or what Nakamoto actually is, but interestingly shows how this missing, anonymous creator of bc is actually another point in its favor.And all that ""wasted"" electricity? Well, that is part of what justifies the whole thing, and becomes a matter of your point of view.I think my favorite aspect of the book, aside from his take on gold, was how beautifully he explains that bc is now, effectively, a living thing with a life of its own and beyond anyone\'s control. If Satoshi is a single person, he is a genius.The one thing the author failed to show, and that is one of my main concerns, is how bc can be considered beyond the reach of government and its bankster masters. Sure, They can\'t ever get control of bc, but kill it? That is another story. If anything, the author shows WHY They would want to do that. BitCoin is money they can\'t control. He does suggest that central banks could start to buy and horde bc, just as they do gold now. I ask: But would it be cost effective to print even more of their fake money to corner the bc market? We\'ll see.One more thing: Refreshingly, compared to so many websites, blogs, YT channels, etc., the author never promotes  bc; he is always realistic about its pitfalls and problems and what a risky investment it has been and will continue to be.\n\n', ""\n\n  When I picked up this book I thought it was about Bitcoin.  It's so much more.  This is by far the best book I've ever read on the history of money and economics.  Saifedean Ammous manages to lay out information in a way that allows you to build a context or framework from which you can better understand what is going on in the world today.  The book covers everything from the Roman Empire to the formation of Constantinople to how WWI was funded and the Bretton Woods Act of 1944.  It is one of the most important books I've ever read and have purchased multiple copies to hand out to family and friends. Understanding money's role in our past has helped me feel better about our future ... even with all the challenges ahead.  My personal view of Bitcoin has completely changed.  Thank you for taking the time to write this Saifedean.  It's very much appreciated.\n\n"", '\n\n  I did not expect a lesson in economics when I picked up this book. But, the author makes the concepts of economics as they apply to his chosen subject matter simpler to understand.Definitely a worthwhile read for those interested in the rise of FIAT currency. This book explores the more recent birth of Bitcoin. Discussing the fact that Bitcoin addresses several of the challenges faced with government money.\n\n', '\n\n  Saifedean makes a great case here as to the value of sound money to create and maintain civilization. He then explains how Bitcoin fulfills the requirements of sound money even better than gold did during the gold standard era. An absolute must for anyone seeking an understanding of what makes Bitcoin valuable and how it can change our world for the better.\n\n', '\n\n  After a great introduction to monetary theory, I was looking forward to coverage of BitCoin that extended beyond the usual technical breakdown. Unfortunately the author goes down a rabbit hole of Keynes bashing and proselytising the Austrian school and the Gold Standard, ultimately failing to deliver much of substance on Bitcoin.\n\n', '\n\n  Took a while to reach but the delivery estimate was accurate. Nice quality book. Didn’t read it yet but looks like a good read. Bought it because of the reviews. Expensive but good quality.\n\n', '\n\n  Understandable teaching about money and what is required for a good to become money.  Explains the monetary policy of Bitcoin and how it compares with other money.  Author has a no-nonsense style which I appreciated for this subject.\n\n']"

  NOW A MAJOR MOTION PICTURE directed by Denis Villeneuve, starring Timothée Chalamet, Zendaya, Jason Momoa, Rebecca Ferguson, Oscar Isaac, Josh Brolin, Stellan Skarsgård, Dave Bautista, David Dastmalchian, Stephen McKinley Henderson, Chang Chen, Sharon Duncan-Brewster, Charlotte Rampling, and Javier Bardem.Frank Herbert’s classic masterpiece—a triumph of the imagination and one of the bestselling science fiction novels of all time.Set on the desert planet Arrakis, Dune is the story of the boy Paul Atreides, heir to a noble family tasked with ruling an inhospitable world where the only thing of value is the “spice” melange, a drug capable of extending life and enhancing consciousness. Coveted across the known universe, melange is a prize worth killing for....When House Atreides is betrayed, the destruction of Paul’s family will set the boy on a journey toward a destiny greater than he could ever have imagined. And as he evolves into the mysterious man known as Muad’Dib, he will bring to fruition humankind’s most ancient and unattainable dream. A stunning blend of adventure and mysticism, environmentalism and politics, Dune won the first Nebula Award, shared the Hugo Award, and formed the basis of what is undoubtedly the grandest epic in science fiction.

Bad guys are so demonstrably evil for no justifiable merit. Lots of characters talking about prophecy.Reading the first few chapters is a slog, and the main character\'s POV isn\'t explored more congruently until much, much later in the book. Most of the adult characters are characteurs or stilted, often internally monologueing to themselves ad nauseum about their distrust in others. Problem with the book is unfortunately the first 1/4 of this is that, and it makes it hard to penetrate into the later parts of the book with Dune, the Freman, and the evolving plot. The backstory of the adults is relatively unnecessary. Later on, the book is its own ""this will be a series"" and ""spoiler alerts,"" so it struggles to live on its own, not that I\'m invested in these people to begin with. Author kills a child with such little fanfare by the other characters at one point. There is a lot of ""it works because we say so"" mechanics that the reader is forced to accept.The one thing that is consistently modern was the discussions on ecology and water preservation. Even more relevant today than it was back then, and I appreciate the extent of research the author put into it. Impressive. Once the 1/3rd of the book comes along, the Freman lifestyle is explored, then I found myself more engaged in it, could read through it. But that first bit is rough.\n\n', '\n\n  This is the third time I read the book. This is the book that inspired George Lucas\' Star Wars and George RR Martin\'s game of Thrones. Enough said.This is NOT an adventure sci-fi book. It\'s more like an intrigue novel à la GoT, in a futuristic environment. Don\'t get me wrong, the sci-fi part is amazing, everything is there for a reason and can be ""explained""\n\n', ""\n\n  Only about halfway through the book, it has been absolutely amazing so far. But this review is not about the content. halfway through the book and I have come across 2 pages that are illegible! as if the printer broke and ink spilt all over the page. It is not a deal break for me, but it pains me to think about what I could be missing in those three pages!I recommend the book highly, but maybe don't buy this version of it.\n\n"", '\n\n  I haven’t finished it yet, I’m part way through part 2, but I find the story far really boring. This could be possibly because I’m more interested in fantasy books I don’t know. I’ve read other sci-fi’s like the TekWar, The Martian and those were really exciting.I haven’t picked up the book in a week and I’m considering reading something else.I may try to finish it before the movie at least, we’ll see.\n\n', '\n\n  Buy the book. The story in this book is very intriguing. My lower rating doesn’t reflect on this amazing book. My rating reflects the shape I received my book in. Bent pages and cover. So if you want a collectors copy, be aware.\n\n', ""\n\n  If you've never read Frank Herbert's 'Dune' you owe it to yourself to give it a go.  Honestly, it gets branded as science fiction all the time but there's actually not much of that about it, other than it taking place in the far future.  It's a story about a noble-born young lad who becomes a messiah figure, and all the politics, warmongering and intrigue that surround him.  Also honestly, it wasn't as good a read as the first time I took it in (forty years ago) but I have, after all, thumbed my way through a heck of a lot of books since then so I guess it simply has more competition now.  With the new movie version by the execrable Villeneuve—who will doubtless turn Dune into Dung—coming along I decided to revisit this classic tale and I enjoyed it again.  Recommended.\n\n"", '\n\n  I love Sci-fi Fantasy and this did not disappoint. I have read quite a few series now, including, ‘Thomas Covenant’ and ‘The Ara’Aki’ and thought it was time to read the well known Dune. It takes you to a completely different world, draws you into the plot with intriguing characters that you come to care about. The setting on Arrakis is unique, along with all the circumstances that come with a planet in which there is little water, i.e. surviving with a stillsuit. I would highly recommend this book and series to sci-fi genre lovers.\n\n', '\n\n  Dune is a great introduction to the series. You can read it as a stand-alone in anticipation to the film but the story really spans throughout the 6 books. There’s a lot to unpack but Herbert is a very accessible writer so even if you’re not an avid reader it’s an enjoyable read. It can be dense with the lore and characters but following an audiobook helps since there are voice actors to help distinguish characters. Read dune and then messiah and then children of dune and so on and so forth.\n\n']"

  #1 NEW YORK TIMES BESTSELLER • From the author of Small Great Things and The Book of Two Ways comes “a powerfully evocative story of resilience and the triumph of the human spirit” (Taylor Jenkins Reid, author of Malibu Rising) Rights sold to Netflix for adaptation as a feature filmDiana O’Toole is perfectly on track. She will be married by thirty, done having kids by thirty-five, and move out to the New York City suburbs, all while climbing the professional ladder in the cutthroat art auction world. She’s an associate specialist at Sotheby’s now, but her boss has hinted at a promotion if she can close a deal with a high-profile client. She’s not engaged just yet, but she knows her boyfriend, Finn, a surgical resident, is about to propose on their romantic getaway to the Galápagos—days before her thirtieth birthday. Right on time.But then a virus that felt worlds away has appeared in the city, and on the eve of their departure, Finn breaks the news: It’s all hands on deck at the hospital. He has to stay behind. You should still go, he assures her, since it would be a shame for all of their nonrefundable trip to go to waste. And so, reluctantly, she goes.Almost immediately, Diana’s dream vacation goes awry. Her luggage is lost, the Wi-Fi is nearly nonexistent, and the hotel they’d booked is shut down due to the pandemic. In fact, the whole island is now under quarantine, and she is stranded until the borders reopen. Completely isolated, she must venture beyond her comfort zone. Slowly, she carves out a connection with a local family when a teenager with a secret opens up to Diana, despite her father’s suspicion of outsiders.In the Galápagos Islands, where Darwin’s theory of evolution by natural selection was formed, Diana finds herself examining her relationships, her choices, and herself—and wondering if when she goes home, she too will have evolved into someone completely different.

Highest praise\n', '\nThought provoking\n', '\nanother great read from Jodi Picoult\n', '\nAwesome\n', '\nAll. The. Stars.\n']","[""\n\n  Brilliant and stunning. I preordered this book months ago when I saw it was about a trip to the Galapagos. I visited the islands 30 years ago, and memories of that enchanting place are still fresh in my mind. Unfortunately, a couple of the early reviews I read gave away the mind-boggling twist but did not interfere with my reading pleasure when the book was finally published. No twists were revealed in this review. This deals with the horror of COVID in heartbreaking, riveting storytelling. Wish You Were Here explores the world that changed almost two years ago when the pandemic entered our lives. It addresses loss, grief, death, pain, isolation, resilience, hope, dreams, sexual identity, and art. It is well-researched on a scientific level but also has some powerful metaphysical themes. This emotional read brought me to tears, and I had to resist a strong urge to peek at the final chapter. Diana O'Toole is approaching her 30th birthday. She has her life well planned and is on a path where everything she hoped for is falling into place. She has decided to be married by age 30 and have two children by the time she is 35. She shares an apartment in New York City with her boyfriend, Finn, a handsome surgical resident. She knows that he is going to propose marriage on an upcoming romantic vacation in the Galapagos. Their future plans are right on schedule. They will live in upper New York and have a bucket list for future travel, children, and a dog. Diana works for Sotheby's in the art acquisition field. She has a new wealthy celebrity client (easily identified as Yoko Ono under a different name.) By selling her valuable painting, she is bound to be awarded a prestigious promotion at the auction house. What could go wrong?  The time is early 2020, and the pandemic has reached NYC. The world we are living in is about to change drastically. So far, there are 19 patients in the hospital with the disease. Finn has been warned that it will rapidly become much worse, despite the denial of President Trump of danger. As the sick and dying flood into the hospital where Finn is working, he cannot leave on holiday. He urges Diana to go on her own since the trip is already paid for. Diana has not gone to movies or a restaurant by herself. Besides Finn, her main friend and confidant is a flamboyant, gay black man, also an employee of the auction house. He plays an important part later in the story. Diana accepts Finn's wish that she travel to the Galapagos on her own for the two-week vacation. This suggestion takes her firmly out of her comfort zone, but she is determined to follow his suggestion and heads to Isabela Island in the Galapagos by herself. As the hospital becomes overwhelmed by patients, Finn is afraid, sleepless, and very stressed. He resents that Diana followed his suggestion rather than staying in their apartment to comfort him when he returns home after long hours on duty and the hopelessness of it all.  He thought she would reject his advice. Frontline workers, like Finn, have shown great heroism during the pandemic. When Diana arrives on Isabela Island, tourists are rushing to leave the Galapagos. It is going into lockdown. Diana is determined to prove herself by staying the two weeks. Her luggage was lost in route. She does not understand the language. Her prepaid hotel is locked down, as are the shops and restaurants. Worse. The banks are closed, and there is no ATM. She does not have sufficient cash on her person. All communication with the outside world is unreliable and spotty. She wants to confirm that she can cope. While wandering in distress, trying to figure what to do, a kindly, older lady leads Diana into her home. People are distant at first because she is an outsider and tourist. As the two-week lockdown is extended and there is no way to leave, they regard her as one of their own. She gradually makes friends with the son of the homeowner. He is a gruff, charismatic man who has a small farm and his daughter, an unhappy, self-harming 14-year-old. She is developing close bonds with these people. She is delighted to explore the wonders of the island with her new friends. The animal life, the landscape, the volcanoes, swimming in the clear waters amongst penguins and sea lions. Nature is described in vivid, atmospheric detail. As the weeks pass, Diana is feeling quite content in her surroundings. Her time there is not without problems. She has written postcards to Finn, assuring him that everything is fine and that she misses him. These were never posted as promised. She is unable to reach him by phone. She gets occasional text messages from him describing the sickness and the horrors he is witnessing and his resentment that she didn't remain home with him. She also must face the news that her much absent and neglectful mother, a Pulitizer Prize-winning photojournalist, had died in a nursing home with early-onset dementia in Diana's absence. She is re-evaluating her life choices, her well-planned schedule, and her past hopes and dreams. She is evolving a new, different identity while trying to work out what is important to her. She is in no hurry to leave the island and her new friends. One day, while swimming in the ocean, she almost drowns and is rescued close to death. Then something very unexpected and shocking occurs that makes us doubt everything we thought we knew. I loved this book, with its location, well-developed, fascinating characters, unexpected revelations, unique plot, and thought-provoking storyline. Some people will find the description of the pandemic too disturbing at this point in time. Highly recommended for readers who can cope with intense images of the chaos inside the hospital wards.\n\n"", ""\n\n  I thought it might be too soon for this subject matter, but I trust the author.  I'm glad I did.  She brought up possibilities and angles that I had never considered during all this.  Not to mention giving us all some excellent advice about how we live our lives, and how we need to examine that from time to time.  Well done.\n\n"", '\n\n  timely and interesting, easy read\n\n', '\n\n  This is by far one of the best books I have read in 2021. I highly recommend it\n\n', ""\n\n  Oh where do I begin with this perfectly beautiful book!? It was everything I want in a novel. Diana goes on a trip alone to the Galápagos Islands,  to avoid losing the money she and her boyfriend spent on the vacation of a lifetime. Finn stays home in New York just as covid hits because he is a doctor and is needed at the hospital. He thinks Diana will be out of harms way while there. The trip gets off to a rocky start, first Diana's luggage is lost, there is no wifi, cell phone connections are almost non-existent and the entire island is going into lockdown. Luckily Diana meets Abdula, her son Gabriel and her granddaughter Beatriz. They help her with food, shelter, companionship and how to navigate the island. One day she and Gabriel go snorkeling and Diana believes she is going to drown...that's where the real story begins.This book read like non-fiction which is understandable seeing as Ms. Picoult based it on a man who got stuck in the Galápagos Islands during lock-down and of course covid being very real these days. The storyline was so heartbreaking and raw and real, while reading these pages I felt so many emotions and loved getting a doctors point of view on covid. This will definitely be one of my favourite reads of the year. I finished it days ago and it is still with me, it is one I won't soon forget, that's for sure. I highly recommend this read to everyone.\n\n""]"

I must confess that even with its excellent writing style and world-building, the story did not manage to thoroughly hook me before the halfway mark, and nothing else but its slow pacing is to blame for that. Nevertheless, looking retrospectively, I am quite relieved to have felt that way as every seed that was sowed and the multitude of stories told, many regarded as legends, all expertly solidify to an overwhelming sense of accomplishment and relief.Sometimes I could barely distinguish reality from fiction, while immersed in this epic tale. The scattered fragments of worldbuilding and characterization finally coalesce, in the latter half, into a world so real and complex that might just exist somewhere out in the universe, and characters that might as well exist besides you, leading their way into a journey I could not help but feel part of.  I haven't experienced this, to this extent, in any other books. That I can safely say.The conclusion is bittersweet and surprised me with the lack of dramatic cliffhangers. That will not fool me, though, as the subtleties sprinkled throughout the book strained the notion that every decision and interaction can provoke irreversible and drastic changes in the Pattern. Needless to say that I will keep reading this amazing story, and can not wait to peer into what the Wheel has weaved around the Two Rivers' folk.\n\n"", '\n\n  There are ink stains on top of the pages and the cover is bent.

  SOMETIMES THE ONE WHO LOVES YOU IS THE ONE WHO HURTS YOU THE MOST Lily hasn't always had it easy, but that's never stopped her from working hard for the life she wants. She's come a long way from the small town in Maine where she grew up - she graduated from college, moved to Boston, and started her own business. So when she feels a spark with a gorgeous neurosurgeon named Ryle Kincaid, everything in Lily's life suddenly seems almost too good to be true.  Ryle is assertive, stubborn, and maybe even a little arrogant. He's also sensitive, brilliant, and has a total soft spot for Lily, but Ryle's complete aversion to relationships is disturbing.  As questions about her new relationship overwhelm her, so do thoughts of Atlas Corrigan - her first love and a link to the past she left behind. He was her kindred spirit, her protector. When Atlas suddenly reappears, everything Lily has built with Ryle is threatened.  With this bold and deeply personal novel, Colleen Hoover delivers a heart-wrenching story that breaks exciting new ground for her as a writer. It Ends With Us is an unforgettable tale of love that comes at the ultimate price.This book contains graphic scenes and very sensitive subject matter.   Read more  ","['1.0 out of 5 stars', '1.0 out of 5 stars', '1.0 out of 5 stars', '1.0 out of 5 stars', '5.0 out of 5 stars', '1.0 out of 5 stars', '5.0 out of 5 stars', '5.0 out of 5 stars']","['\nSame cover, different book.\n', '\nI DIDNT GET THE RIGHT BOOK!!!\n', '\nDEFECTIVE\n', '\nNot even the same book!\n', '\nA Real Page Tuner\n', '\nPoor writing; juvenile\n', '\nHeart wrenching\n', '\nEmotional and Personal\n']","['\n\n  The book has the same exact covers but has a different story inside.

It’s such a deep book and just like the main character it makes you feel different waves of emotions. I cried several times throughout the book which is the telling of a great author.

The spoilers pertain mostly to the set up of the story, and don't give away any major plot points, but I know some people prefer to go in totally blind!This is a super personal story for the author, and I'm sure for many readers. It's touching and emotional in every way.  I don't know that I would go so far as to say it is unlike anything Colleen has written before, but it has the uniqueness that pervades all of her books, while still following a similar journey of finding your way in life in your early 20's.[start spoiler]Naked truth: I didn’t love part one of this book. It was slow building and very focused on Lily’s past rather than immersing me in the current story. I get why – it’s very important context for part two, but I still didn’t love it. Part of what I loved about November 9 (my favourite CoHo book), was how quickly the reader is immersed in and invested in the story – because the characters live a whole year apart, and it makes the time actually spent together so much more dramatic and interesting. The set up with the diary entries isn’t my favourite style of writing, and so, I thought this book would end up being around 4 stars for me.Then I got to part two. The story shifts pretty dramatically. The chapters are shorter and much more plot driven. Everything is more emotional, and it felt like everything I love about Colleen Hoover’s writing. It was heart wrenching and beautiful and so compelling I couldn’t stop until I was done. I loved every second of part two, even when it was tearing my heart into two parts. All the stars for part two. I think that evens out to 5 stars in general for the book.This was a painful story, but one that I highly recommend. If you’ve loved Colleen in the past, just know that the first half is a little slow building, but please please please keep reading. It is so worth it. You’ll be a different person by the end, I promise. If you’ve never read Colleen or had no interest in her previously, read It Ends With Us even if you read nothing else by this author. I have a feeling this book will hit a lot of people very hard, and while I have no personal experience with the subject matter, I was loudly sobbing by the epilogue. I was so invested in this story and ALL of the characters. The last chapter was a punch in the gut in the best way, leaving me loving the overall story completely.(end spoiler)Review immediately upon finishing: *sobs audibly in the corner*I just need a minute...or a couple days.

  The best-selling investing ""bible"" offers new information, new insights, and new perspectives  The Little Book of Common Sense Investing is the classic guide to getting smart about the market. Legendary mutual fund  pioneer John C. Bogle reveals his key to getting more out of investing: low-cost index funds. Bogle describes the simplest and most effective investment strategy for building wealth over the long term: buy and hold, at very low cost, a mutual fund that tracks a broad stock market Index such as the S&P 500. While the stock market has tumbled and then soared since the first edition of Little Book of Common Sense was published in April 2007, Bogle’s investment principles have endured and served investors well.  This tenth anniversary edition includes updated data and new information but maintains the same long-term perspective as in its predecessor.  Bogle has also added two new chapters designed to provide further guidance to investors:  one on asset allocation, the other on retirement investing. A portfolio focused on index funds is the only investment that effectively guarantees your fair share of stock market returns. This strategy is favored by Warren Buffett, who said this about Bogle: “If a statue is ever erected to honor the person who has done the most for American investors, the hands-down choice should be Jack Bogle. For decades, Jack has urged investors to invest in ultra-low-cost index funds. . . . Today, however, he has the satisfaction of knowing that he helped millions of investors realize far better returns on their savings than they otherwise would have earned. He is a hero to them and to me.” Bogle shows you how to make index investing work for you and help you achieve your financial goals, and finds support from some of the world's best financial minds: not only Warren Buffett, but Benjamin Graham, Paul Samuelson, Burton Malkiel, Yale’s David Swensen, Cliff Asness of AQR, and many others. This new edition of The Little Book of Common Sense Investing offers you the same solid strategy as its predecessor for building your financial future.  Build a broadly diversified, low-cost portfolio without the risks of individual stocks, manager selection, or sector rotation. Forget the fads and marketing hype, and focus on what works in the real world. Understand that stock returns are generated by three sources (dividend yield, earnings growth, and change in market valuation) in order to establish rational expectations for stock returns over the coming decade. Recognize that in the long run, business reality  trumps market expectations. Learn how to harness the magic of compounding returns while avoiding the tyranny of compounding costs.  While index investing allows you to sit back and let the market do the work for you, too many investors trade frantically, turning a winner’s game into a loser’s game. The Little Book of Common Sense Investing is a solid guidebook to your financial future.

  New York Times BestsellerThe new must-read epic from master storyteller Ken Follett: more than a thriller, it’s an action-packed, globe-spanning drama set in the present day.   “A compelling story, and only too realistic.” —Lawrence H. Summers, former U.S. Treasury Secretary “Every catastrophe begins with a little problem that doesn’t get fixed.” So says Pauline Green, president of the United States, in Follett’s nerve-racking drama of international tension.   A shrinking oasis in the Sahara Desert; a stolen US Army drone; an uninhabited Japanese island; and one country’s secret stash of deadly chemical poisons: all these play roles in a relentlessly escalating crisis.   Struggling to prevent the outbreak of world war are a young woman intelligence officer; a spy working undercover with jihadists; a brilliant Chinese spymaster; and Pauline herself, beleaguered by a populist rival for the next president election. Never is an extraordinary novel, full of heroines and villains, false prophets and elite warriors, jaded politicians and opportunistic revolutionaries. It brims with cautionary wisdom for our times, and delivers a visceral, heart-pounding read that transports readers to the brink of the unimaginable.

  If you see her, then you're dead...All Rob wanted to do was fit in at his new school after being torn from London so his parents could fix their marriage. But when Rob's journalist father dragged him along to investigate the legend of the Witchopper for the local paper, her curse became their reality.She was priestess to the pagan god of the wild wood, hanged by a rabid mob for her unspeakable crimes. Now, something far worse than the hell of high school is after Rob and his dad...In the vein of The Wickerman and Midsommar, Witchopper is an epic ordeal of a father and son relationship, where past sins echo in the present. Dan Soule delivers another of his terrifying Fright Nights, with a tale of love, lies and truth that will leave you sleeping with the light on. Praise for the author'Powerful and haunting' Adrian J.

His novel ‘Neolithica‘ was highly recommended to me by both Ross Jeffery and Joseph Sale, but, unfortunately, with how swamped I was at the time with review requests, I didn’t get to reading it. When ‘Witchopper‘ was announced, I was immediately intrigued. Look at that cover! That is a thing of beauty. Add in the premise of a horror-folklore story and I’m hooked. I’ll be diving into ‘Neolithica‘ here now shortly, as well.What I liked: While the premise is simple in it’s set up, trust me when I say, this book has layers. Meet Rob. Rob is a teen, struggling to fit in at school, moved away from his friend’s when his dad takes a new job. His dad is a journalist. Always up for following the story, going where it takes you. But Rob and his dad are struggling to keep some semblance of a relationship.This relationship dynamic adds a significant amount of tension and one thing I enjoyed was it grounded the story in the here and now, especially when the curse of the Witchopper begins to wrap its talons around the story itself.Soule crafted a fantastic take on this folklore story – truthfully, I don’t know if the Witchopper is a real being in history, I haven’t wanted to Google it all, simply because I don’t want to spoil any of the charm Soule conjured within this book.What I didn’t like: At first, I wasn’t too keen on the Father-Son dynamic, it felt a bit rushed at the beginning, but that worked itself out shortly thereafter. The book goes full slow burn at the start, which may be tougher for some folks who don’t do well with slower beginnings, but the payoff is worth it.Why you should buy it: Soule is a fantastic writer and ‘Witchopper‘ is a worthy addition to the growing list of folklore horror. While I haven’t seen the movie ‘Midsommer‘ which is listed on the synopsis as a comparison, I definitely see the influence of the seminal ‘The Wicker Man,’ which should be all you need to know to decide if you want to dive into this fantastic book!\n\n', '\n\n  This book is absolutely impossible to put down. Dan Soule sure knows how to capture us and keep us prisonner in his narrative so that a short night of sleep is ahead as well as constant anxiety if we dare to leave the book to go, say eat or wash the dishes.I had a ball reading this book in which it is the story of a journalist, trying to put his family back together and getting closer to his son, ends up following a story of the Witchopper, but ends up getting much more than he previously thought he would have to deal with, putting the very life of his son in danger in the process.If you have read previous books by Dan Soule, you will find common themes and an obsession for you reader to finish his book in one sitting. Trust me, there is no other way of doing it.\n\n', '\n\n  Dan Soule is pure gold. This is an amazing trip in so many ways.

  From New York Times Bestselling authors Vi Keeland and Penelope Ward comes a new, sexy standalone novel.It all started with a bet.When my young son inherited half of his great grandfather’s historic inn, I decided to move us both to the place where I grew up.Notice I said half of the Inn.  The other half now belonged to Levi Miller, the famous quarterback who had other ideas about what we should do with the property.We won’t mention that I accidentally injured him during our first meeting, causing him to get eight stitches.You could say we got off on the wrong foot.We bickered a lot as we both moved into the property while we figured things out.He wanted to unload the rundown place which, admittedly, needed a lot of work.I wanted to restore The Palm Inn to its original beauty and re-open it as a bed and breakfast.We couldn’t agree on anything.  So Levi made me a proposal.  One he thought I would surely lose.  If I could sell out the place by the time he had to leave for training at the end of summer, he would back off and let me run it.But in the weeks that followed, we got more than we bargained for while we were living under the same roof.Levi and I got closer, and before I knew it, my nightly fantasies about the brawny Adonis became a reality. Not to mention, he was so great with my son.We were in over our heads in more ways than one.Because not only was he the last man on Earth I should be falling for because of our deal, but Levi was also my ex’s older brother.And now the inn was the least of my problems.

I hated the main character so much I cannot even remember her name! I am searching for the character that was the show stopper and there isn’t one. I had to go back i to the book to get her name, Presley! Not sure how well played this one was. Alex the son was okay. Tanner is the ex, but not really cause he never married Presley and he was a drunk who decided to come back and “claim” what wasn’t his to begin with…leaving his brother Levi who had fallen for Presley in a quandary. That quandary was mostly Presley whining about “not telling anyone, or getting caught, or hurting her son” to the exclusion of all the others. And it was so painful watching her waffle between the two brothers…Seriously, if I were Levi I would have left too. So Levi leaves, as the right thing to do to go back to his NFL career and try to let Presley and Tanner have a shot, at what I am still not sure…Tanner was a serial cheater, drunk, gambler, absent dad and came back entitled as all get out. Him cheating again, surprise was one of the highlights. Fern, the old lady living in the Inn with them not sure what her role was. I am so sad that this whole thing was as confusing as my review. Seriously these writers rock! What happened. 3 stars is pretty generous for this story that had so much potential.\n\n', '\n\n  This  story  moved fast and made a fantastic read. The  secrets  and  strong  family ties  are  a few events in this book that  made it a very awesome must read.

I can feel his eyes on me over the breakfast table, and my heart pumps so hard when I hear him pull in the driveway after work.I have to stop this. It can't happen.My sister once told me there are no good men, and if you find one, he's probably unavailable.Only Pike Lawson isn't the unavailable one.I am.PIKEI took her in, because I thought I was helping.She'd cook a few meals and clean up a little.

I can't touch her, and I shouldn't want to.The more I find my path crossing hers, though, the more she's becoming a part of me.But we're not free to give into this.

While parts of this book are definitely cute the taboo tone the blurb and text was promising was not much of a success.The angst and longing promise because the heroine was pining after her boyfriend’s dad does not land well. This book is a conventional romance with a a lead couple with a large age difference. In that light it does well enough but it isn’t why I picked up the book.The heroine, Jordan, was a good character. She is young so her pride (read stubbornness) and her constant doubting of her self worth were realistic. A bit much if you’re older but nothing unreal. She read a little older than her age but I guess that was the point - she was a old soul in a young body. It made the romance between her and the hero, Pike, all the more believable.The boyfriend on the other hand was real non-entity. He is objectively a jerk but he hardly appears in the story and gets no POV. This hurt the story as I really didn’t care that Jordan was thinking of his dad or that she was afraid of cheating. Pike’s angst about lusting after his son’s girlfriend was a little more believable, but again, without knowing the son it didn’t really matter to the emotional core of the story. I just wanted the leads to get together.The story is definitely more of a slow-burn romance which takes it time. For being this sexy book, there is actually no sex in the first half. Once the couple gets together they go at it but the relationship part of the book is actually pretty short. They spend more time mooning after each other which can get a bit dull to read. It would have been nice to see more steam - or perhaps shorten the book by 10% or so.I do give the book credit for making Jordan more aggressive than typical heroines - she knew what she wanted. Good for her.In the end, I am giving this an average rating of 2 as it was ok. It wasn’t what I was promised. I will say that if expectations are adjusted this will likely be enjoyable for people. The writing is nice enough and parts of the book are pretty cute and sexy\n\n', '\n\n  It hurts me to write this review. I love Penelope’s writing soooo much, and I was so sad I didn’t love this book more 😔. This is still a decent book, my issues with it are spoilers, so you’ll have to read on my blog if you want my juicy thoughts…This book explores an age gap theme with an interesting twist in my opinion. Jordan and her boyfriend Cole have lost their apartment and need a place to stay while they regroup and save up money. Cole’s father Pike offers them to stay with him in exchange for chores around the house to try helping them out. Even though the relationship between Pike and Cole has been struggling and estranged for the past few years and the beginning is kinda super awkward for everyone, this seems like the best solution. The kids can save money and Pike can work on his relationship with his son.Only when Pike and Jordan see how much disdain Cole has for his father, they see him spending less and less time at home. Which means Jordan is picking up the slack with everything to cover both of them. Which also means she ends up spending more time with Pike than Cole is… also spending more time with Pike THAN Cole since they never seem able to find him…This book is interesting with a few different twists that come up along the way. Read on my blog the issues I have with specifics that include spoilers. It’s still a decent read with some suspense, hot scenes, and a lot of tension building constantly throughout the book until things explode everywhere. Even though o didn’t love it as much as I usually do a Penelope book, I still couldn’t put it down and still do recommend giving it a shot cause you might love it more than I did!\n\n', ""\n\n  I definitely went in with the wrong expectations.I wanted something quick and dirty (more erotica-esque but still has substance) and this was nothing of the sort. It was painfully slow. Like, I'm all for slow burn romances but we really don't light a match until the 50% mark. It didn't read like a forbidden romance or have that delicious tension. It just made the whole book drag; the exposition is far too long.Jordan was a little all over the place; during the sexy times she would become this whole other person that just seemed so out of character. Easy could have cut out 100 pages and still got the same story across.\n\n""]"

  COVID-19 and the Global Predators is much more than an analysis of the current exploitation of humanity under cover of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. It discloses for the first time the actual blueprint and master plan that that was ten years in the making by global predators before the pandemic: a plan to reorganize the world in the name of public health. Billionaires, government agencies, giant funds, and major industries collaborated years ahead of time to lay the groundwork for what would become Operation Warp Speed and the Great Reset in 2020.  All this is disclosed, individuals and groups are named, and their plans for the future are documented. The book concludes with chapters on what America and the world must do in the coming weeks and months to save humanity's freedoms. Many top medical and public health experts treating and examining COVID 19 agree this is the most comprehensive book about who and what is behind the draconian measures that are crushing individual freedoms and many of the societies and economies of the Western World including the United States, Canada, Great Britain, and Australia.Three of these medical doctors have confirmed this in their introductions to the book: physicians Peter McCullough MD MPH, Vladimir ""Zev"" Zelenko MD and Elizabeth Lee Vliet MD. They are echoed by endorsements from Robert F Kennedy Jr. and Paul Alexander PhD. This book thoroughly documents solid answers to these tragic questions about the global predators who are reaping enormous benefits from COVID-19 suffering including wealth, power and the destruction of America as an opposition to globalism. Who are the ""they""-these Global Predators? What are their motives and their plans for us?How can we defend against them? Why did they:■  Plan Warp Speed for a SARS-CoV pandemic years before it came?■  Distribute mRNA and DNA vaccines that killed lab animals and now humans?■  Collaborate with the Chinese making pandemic viruses & bioweapons?■  Hide the origin of SARS-CoV-2 in the Wuhan Institute?■  Let China spread the virus around the world on passenger planes?■  Give so much power to Dr. Anthony Fauci?Why do they continue to:■  Prohibit cheap, available, safe and eﬀective COVID-19 treatments?■  Impose draconian closures on our society and economy?■  Disproportionately harm or destroy small businesses and churches?■  Make us wear masks and distance ourselves from each other?■  Exaggerate the death rate from COVID-19 to frighten us?■  Hide the high and growing vaccine death rate from all of us?■  Make experimental ""vaccines"" that turn our bodies against ourselves?Dr. Breggin is a physician with 70+ scientiﬁc articles and 20+ medical texts and popular books. Heis among the world's most experienced medical experts in landmark legal cases in psychiatry andneurosurgery, and now in COVID-19. The Breggins' bestsellers include Talking Back to Prozac andToxic Psychiatry. Their research led the United States to cancel the deadly Chinese collaboration.Breggin is an intrepid scholar and is assiduous and methodological as he assembles all the pieces to the puzzle. His research, carried out with his wife Ginger, is impeccable, and his incisive approach sears the neck of those whose aim it is to wield power, control, and instill fear among the world's wealthiest nations.

And read it carefully!  It is not an easy read, but it is an essential read.  I say essential because before anything in this chaotic, fearful world can improve, the public needs to understand the WHY of what is taking place, who are the players, both major and minor, and what is their motivation.  Once this is understood,  much of the confusion about what is happening throughout the world will fall away and things will become clearer.Peter Breggin, M.D. and Ginger Breggin, in this thoroughly researched book, ""connect the dots"" between the globalist billionaires,  the one per cent of the total population who, in collaboration with the Communist Party of China, released SARS-COV-2 on the world to purposely remake society, economically, politically, socially  and indeed in every other way,  as per Klaus Schwab and the Great Reset.  This is all in order to further their agenda of power and profit at the expense of the rest of humanity.The authors have cited multiple documents providing evidence that the pandemic was preplanned by the global ""elites"" and the CCP to kick start this plan and gain unprecedented power over the global population, all the while amassing further billions for themselves.  Overwhelming evidence is presented that U. S. laboratories were indeed collaborating with ones in China, primarily the one in Wuhan, performing gain of function research.  This was all done under the auspices of the mainstream media darling and science ""icon"", Dr. Anthony Fauci.Dr. Breggin is eminently qualified to write on the subject of pharmaceutical companies,  their research methods,  marketing strategies and their incestuous relationships with federal health agencies, including the FDA and CDC, and how politics intertwine with both.  He is a former teaching fellow at Harvard Medical School and has published dozens of scientific articles and more than twenty books on the subject of psycho pharmaceuticals.  He has served as a medical expert in both civil and criminal trials involving psychiatric drugs, as well as product liability lawsuits against drug manufacturers.  To say he is well versed in the ways of pharmaceutical companies is an understatement.In this book, the Breggins also present evidence of how early mortality predictions were grossly overestimated and how scare tactics,  euphemistically renamed ""fear appeals"" have driven government agendas in order to obtain compliance vis- a- vis lockdowns, restrictions on assembly, travel, vaccines, etc. around the globe.  They also document how effective, inexpensive treatments have been purposely made unavailable to so many COVID-19 patients, resulting in untold numbers of unnecessary deaths.The authors point out the loss of fundamental freedoms suffered in all western democracies,  including the United States, all to the benefit of the CCP and the globalist billionaires.This book compiles, in an orderly, precise manner, the disparate pieces of information that are actually in the public domain, that the reader needs to actually make sense of what at times seems so incomprehensible.  These pieces of information will never be put together by any mainstream media outlet, as both mainstream media and the tech giants are complicit actors in this scheme toward total globalization and totalitarianism.  When all of these pieces of information are assembled logically, the reader can make sense of why SARS-COV-2 was unleashed on the world and the ultimate objective of those who contrived this crime against humanity.  It should serve as a wake up call to citizens of every country to stand up to this nefarious authoritarian, top down power grab.  The globalist one per centers and the Chinese Communist Party have no morals, ethics or loyalties to anything other than power and profit.  If we do not stand up, once freedom is lost, it will be nearly impossible to regain.Peter Breggin comments that once the CCP gains the dominance it seeks, it will then devour the globalist billionaires who aided and abetted its rise to global preeminence.  This is akin to the snake that ultimately devours its own tail, and history abounds with examples to support this assertion.  Be that as it may, it is no comfort to WE THE PEOPLE to know that we are to be devoured in the process, reduced to serfs, existing only to do the bidding of global power, bereft of our God given rights and freedoms.Read this book, absorb its facts and ponder the evidence presented.  You will then be in a much better position to understand both how you are being manipulated and the urgent need stand up to the tyrants who are systematically taking away our freedoms.\n\n', ""\n\n  Great, exhaustively researched book.  Will change your entire outlook on what's really going on in the world.Get the hardcover....Kindle sucks.\n\n"", '\n\n  The authors give 100% proof of the title.

He was the perfect boyfriend, but on the day he was going to propose, she broke his heart. A year later he married his travel agent, while Sophie has been mortifyingly single ever since. Now Thomas is back in her life because Sophie has unexpectedly inherited his aunt Connie's house on Scribbly Gum Island—home of the famously unsolved Munro Baby mystery.Sophie moves onto the island and begins a new life as part of an unconventional family, where it seems everyone has a secret. Grace, a beautiful young mother, is feverishly planning a shocking escape from her perfect life. Margie, a frumpy housewife, has made a pact with a stranger, while dreamy Aunt Rose wonders if maybe it's about time she started making her own decisions.As Sophie's life becomes increasingly complicated, she discovers that sometimes you have to stop waiting around—and come up with your own fairy-tale ending.

  “If you liked Chaos, you’ll love Complexity. Waldrop creates the most exciting intellectual adventure story of the year” (The Washington Post).   In a rarified world of scientific research, a revolution has been brewing. Its activists are not anarchists, but rather Nobel Laureates in physics and economics and pony-tailed graduates, mathematicians, and computer scientists from all over the world. They have formed an iconoclastic think-tank and their radical idea is to create a new science: complexity. They want to know how a primordial soup of simple molecules managed to turn itself into the first living cell—and what the origin of life some four billion years ago can tell us about the process of technological innovation today.   This book is their story—the story of how they have tried to forge what they like to call the science of the twenty-first century.   “Lucidly shows physicists, biologists, computer scientists and economists swapping metaphors and reveling in the sense that epochal discoveries are just around the corner . . . [Waldrop] has a special talent for relaying the exhilaration of moments of intellectual insight.” —The New York Times Book Review    “Where I enjoyed the book was when it dove into the actual question of complexity, talking about complex systems in economics, biology, genetics, computer modeling, and so on. Snippets of rare beauty here and there almost took your breath away.” —Medium   “[Waldrop] provides a good grounding of what may indeed be the first flowering of a new science.” —Publishers Weekly     Read more  ","['5.0 out of 5 stars', '3.0 out of 5 stars', '5.0 out of 5 stars', '4.0 out of 5 stars', '5.0 out of 5 stars']","['\nGood quality by company\n', '\nThree Stars\n', '\nWonderful reading for every science enthusiast!\n', '\nThe Making of the Santa Fe Institute\n', '\nThinkers from the Land of Enchantment.\n']","['\n\n  My book came on time. It is in good condition.\n\n', '\n\n  Dated\n\n', '\n\n  The cover of the book says "" If you liked Chaos, you will love complexity"". I just finished reading the book, that validated the claim. While Chaos is written as story of discovery of a new science, Complexity excels as a saga of men who ventured into previously unchartered domains addressing for the first time issues like:What is life? What is driving force that caused cells to appear from a primordal soup of all elements, when the probability of so happening is infinitesimal? What causes evolution? Do nice guys finish last? What makes evolution, coevolution, adaptation, extinction work? Why do we organize ourselves into families, cultures, nations?Why do stock markets crash, boom? What controls the emergence of economies? Why can USSR go from one of strongest nations/economies to the state of divided helplessness in less than a few years?Why are we here? What is life? Artificial Life? Are we still evolving? What is the cause of increasing complexity?On mundane level: What is non-linearity? What is Chaos? If this science is all that important, why did we wait this long for recognizing it?What are the paradigms in which sociology and physics settle into same patterns? How neural networks were born, brought up and mastered?This novel/book is as much about these questions as it is about the scientists who engaged in unravelling many of these mysteries. It speaks about their failures and successes, their approach, ethic and driving force, their fears, fights and friendships. For most part it reads like a thriller, and by the time you are done, you find yourself searching for another book on Chaos, complexity, life at the edge of chaos, genetic algorithms, artificial intelligence. After just 358 pages, your imagination and knowledge of science leaps from Newton\'s linear models to the twentyfirst century stuff.\n\n', '\n\n  I bought this book back in 1994, when it was released as a paperback in the UK. I liked it tremendously, and although I let a dozen friends or so borrow it from me to read, I was keeping its track very meticulously in order to get it back every time. Complexity is one of those books that easily gets lost if you are not careful, you know.In short, the book is a chronicle of at the time seemingly unrelated ideas that finally led to forming of the Santa Fe Institute in 1984, and the people who created them: the economist Brian Arthur and his lock-in theory of ""increasing returns"" (better known to engineers as ""positive feedback""); Stuart Kaufmann and his ""autocatalytic"" models for evolving biological systems; John Holland and his genetic algorithms and genetic programming; Christopher Langton and his ""artificial life""; Doyne Farmer with all his experience with chaos theory; and of course the ""founding fathers"" of the Santa Fe Institute: George Cowan, Kenneth Arrow, and two Nobel-prize winners, Murray Gell-Mann and Philip Anderson.With a PhD in Physics, MA in Journalism and over ten years of service as a senior science writer for one of the world\'s most prestigious science journals - Science - M. Mitchell Waldrop seems like a role-model science writer. Complexity is his second book, being predecessed by Man Made Minds, a survey of artificial intelligence. This book, however, bears much greater resemblance in style with James Gleick\'s bestseller Chaos than with his own previous work.Some ""historical distance"" allows us also a somewhat more critical view on the complexity theory itself. Contrary to the popular expectations of the time, complexity was since forced to follow the same path that chaos, fractals or catastrophe theory - to name a few - traveled before it, and admit that is not The Great Universal Theory of Everything. On the other hand, while the hype is gone, we have to admit that complexity - or ""nonlinear science"", if you want - is still very actively worked on.So is this book for you? Yes, if you want vivid explanation of one of the most important ideas that shaped the end of the 20th century, and colorful portraits of the people behind it. If nothing else, it will wet your mouth. If Complexity will succeed in winning your interest, you may want to proceed with other popular reading on this topic - almost everyone of the people mentioned before has himself published at least one book. For learning more hard science, however, you should reach for other science monographs and papers.\n\n', '\n\n  The recombinant DNA technology pioneers had their heyday at Asilomar; the Manhattan Project brought together some of the best minds in physics at a pivotal time of the century just passed; lately, tucked between the Jemez  Mountains and the Sangre de Cristo Mountains of northern New Mexico,  think-tankers at the Sante Fe Institute brought us the concept of order at  the brink of chaos.  The universe, and life as we know it, teeters close to  the edge of all-out disorder and boring, predictable superorganization and  ""super-stability"", and somehow has managed to stay always in  between.  Roll the tape of the evolution of the universe and life backward,  allow it to move forward, and see whether complexity is an intrinsic  property of the cosmos rather than happenstance.  Does Stuart Kauffman\'s  ""order for free"" tendency for self-organization operate in past  and future---or other---universes?This book is a good primer to the  concept of complexity as applied to economics, life, and the universe, and  is an engaging read.  I can imagine some biologists would tend to check out  Kauffman\'s book ""At home in the universe"" after reading  ""Complexity"".\n\n']"

A great read for Christmas time with the kids. Do note that in order for the lights at the back of the book to flash, you will need to have a light source available (almost as if it's solar-powered, but isn't). I thought the battery was already dead but when I brought it into a well-lit room they appeared. They do not appear in the dark.\n\n"", ""\n\n  Not as great of a story as the original Little Blue Truck but still fun for the kids with a nice holiday theme.

We read it over and over and he loves the Christmas lights on the last page.

But the problem is she had some sort of accident that gave her amnesia. So we're left wondering how exactly she got into the accident, who her current guardians are and WHY have they made it their/Scarlett's mission to destroy them.Book 1 of this series is such a perfect r set up for a series, hooks you on the characters and story and also leaves you desperate  to know the answers to all of your questions.Now let's talk about these horsemen!Holy hell they are spicy.West is downright psychopathic (well they all are) but west is just so hard around the edges. He is so hurt that the woman he's been in love with since he was 16 doesn't remember him. He's clearly trying to protect himself by keeping her at a distance.Pres - He's your cinnamon roll of the group.

They're possessive, domineering, control freaks who are kinky as f*k. But we haven't managed to Crack their shells yet.And its still hard to really see who Scar is.

This story has very little sunshine and no rainbows, if there were flowers, they would be beautifully black. But not to worry, you are also in for the most amazing treat, the storytelling and writing talents of this fantastic author! Pay attention to the warnings, this story is about two tasks, each determined for revenge and to destroy the other.

  “Dr. Jason Fung has done it again. In easy to follow, simple steps and rules, Dr. Fung gives you the tools to rid yourself of diabetes forever. Get this book!”—Dr. Steven R. Gundry, author of The Plant ParadoxThe must-have guide to reversing and preventing type 2 diabetes through intermittent fasting and a low-carb, high-fat diet—from Dr. Jason Fung, internationally best selling author of The Obesity Code.Today, most doctors, dietitians, and even diabetes specialists consider type 2 diabetes to be a chronic and progressive disease—a life sentence with no possibility of parole. But the truth, as Dr. Fung reveals in this paradigm-shifting book, is that type 2 diabetes is reversible. Writing with clear, persuasive language, he explains why conventional treatments that rely on insulin or other blood-glucose-lowering drugs can actually exacerbate the problem, leading to significant weight gain and even heart disease. The only way to treat type 2 diabetes effectively, he argues, is proper dieting and intermittent fasting—not medication.

This book completely reversed my thinking on diabetes. His book is well-researched with pages of references at the back of the book.  There is a lot on why diabetes is at epidemic proportions in North America and other countries around the world.  He also explains why it is such a serious disease and what it does to our body.

I would give this book 10 stars if it was allowed.  Highly, highly recommend it.\n\n', '\n\n  Finally a book on Diabetes that is truthful. Stopped taking 2 Metformin 500mg and another 2 pills for Diabetes over a month now. No more pills for me, dropped A1C from 7.4 to 5.4 in 1 week, then gradually went up to and holding at 6.

The book is very interesting and dives into great detail about how insulin resistance develops and why more and more people are becoming diabetic these days.

And if you’re planning on enjoying a cup of Earl Grey with this quality e-book, please remember: it’s tea first, milk second. Finally, don’t be afraid to laugh thunderously when reading this novel.

  From USA Today Bestselling author Adriana Locke comes a workplace romance between a grumpy, alpha architect and his new client—who just so happens to have the blueprint to bring him to his knees. Romance is not in Wade Mason’s portfolio.This is tragic. It’s unfair that a man so maddeningly gorgeous—an architect with a deliciously squarish jaw, adorably dimpled chin, and the hottest black glasses that straddle the line between professional and provocative—rebukes all things love. I knew this well before I walked into his office. The man is a conundrum—a complicated, steel wall of a puzzle. On the one hand, he brushes against me in the conference room with a broodiness that sets me on fire. He demands in-person meetings about the house we are working on together. I catch him watching me out of the corner of his eye with a look that’s anything but platonic. But any talk of hookups, love, or relationships—even in general? Completely off the table. I’m determined to peel back his layers until I get to the bottom of the mysterious businessman. But my plan is foiled by a surprise that leaves both of us reeling. Neither of us sees it coming, but it changes everything … forever.

He's been the mysterious one, the broody, sometimes downright rude, grumpy brother who you really didn't know a whole lot about, which made me think there was a WHOLE LOT to uncover where he was concerned. And boy, IS THERE!!!!Adriana Locke saved the BEST for last, in my humble opinion, as far as the Mason's are concerned! Wade and Dara, who is the absolutely PERFECT foil for him, are what slow burn romances SHOULD be! I LOVED everything about this one! It gave me EVERY SINGLE FEEL that an AMAZING Adriana Locke book delivers (X 1000!!!) I would go so far as to say that Resolution is in my TOP 3 BOOKS from this author, that's how much I loved it! I even loved the parts that ripped out my heart and made me cry huge fat UGLY CRY tears, because it all just made the end that much more sweet! It was sooooooo worth every one of them!Ms. Locke has delivered what feels like her soul in a book and I can't recommend this one highly or strongly enough! YOU TRULY DO NOT WANT TO MISS THIS ONE!!!!\n\n"", ""\n\n  Resolution is so much more than I could have even hoped for!  Wade has definitely met his match with Dara, their chemistry is undeniable 🔥  There is so much heart packed into this book, and the interactions between everyone keeps you wanting more!The Mason's (as well as Landry & Gibson families) are all amazing 💜 The way Adriana Locke interconnects them and keeps true to the individual characters makes you want to read them over and over again!\n\n"", ""\n\n  I'm a huge fan of Adriana's writing and the families she writes about. That being said this was one of my absolute favorite books of hers. It was incredibly well done and the emotions were so incredibly real!\n\n"", '\n\n  I had been waiting for Wade story for months now.  I love Wade’s personality.  A wizard, genius and love his witty direct comments.  I might start binge the rest of the Landry stories.\n\n', '\n\n  Finally ! So excited to finally get Wades book. It was worth the wait!! Wade was so uptight. Dara had her sights set on him since the beginning.\n\n', ""\n\n  The title of this book is just right. From being the last book of a series, you want to see things resolved to the grumpy cat of a man named Wade Mason. Who is one ornery ball of irritation and tension or so it seems. He's battling something inside himself and is completely unwilling to let it out. Until he meets Dara Alden, whose bold cheerfulness starts unravelling him by poking holes in tough exterior from the moment they meet.Wade is definitely swoony once you get past his thorny exterior but to me, Dara is the star of this book. I love that she's instantly attracted to him but it's not what motivates her. She's intuitive enough to understand his limitations and instead thoughtfully push Wade's boundaries even when she had no plans to be with him. She wants him to see past himself to the amazing person underneath. Her sunshiny demeanor pulls you into their dynamic.These two characters are so much more than meets the eye and their luggage is slowly unpacked as their chemistry and attraction continuously pulls them together. They're so deep in denial and excellent banter until they get down to their true selves and find they're more similar than they thought.I am so sad to see the end of the Mason brothers but loved all the glimpses of Holt, Coy, Oliver and Boone and their better halves that we got in this book. It's like they've all pulled together to make sure Wade, the most emotionally contained and stubborn of them all gets his HEA. Even good ol' dad makes a significant impact in this one instead of my favourite book mom ever, Siggy Mason. Which leads me to think...this IS called Mason FAMILY series. I would love to see what is going to happen with Siggy and her husband. Their story feels...unfinished.Resolution is a poignant love story with humorous and deeply loving moments. Wade and Dara's story is so worth the read. They will pull on your heartstrings and have you shipping them from the get-go. The Mason Family series is definitely binge-worthy holiday reading. One-click Resolution today!\n\n"", ""\n\n  I've been waiting for Wade's story ... he's been so mysterious throughout the whole series. He tries to avoid everyone, except for family. I just love his niece, Rosie and how she's just so taken with him. It makes me laugh-out-loud how over the top she is about him ... grabbing onto his legs and not letting him go ... CUTE! I love how Dara is so sarcastic and doesn't let Wade get away with anything. Then there's the chemistry between Wade and Dara ... it's so off the charts that even Wade can't ignore it. This has been a great series and I'm presuming this is the last book as all the brothers have had a book. I'm sorry it's over because I have really enjoyed this series. The banter between the brothers is so realistic and the situations are everyday occurrences.I received an early copy courtesy of the author in exchange for a honest review.\n\n"", ""\n\n  Resolution is the fifth book in the Mason Family, and the one I have been waiting for. This is a slow burning, emotional, well written, tension filled, romantic read.  Wade is the last man to fall in love, he is grumpy, and holds his cards close to his chest, but the moment the little tornado comes into his life, nothing is the same.  Dana is so strong willed, and I liked her. I liked the back and forth banter between them, and talk about sexual tension.  I like that the Mason Family make an appearance too.I enjoyed this series, and I'm gonna miss this family so much.\n\n""]"

I think it has to do with the internal monologue of the main character. Our MC in this one was Vanessa, and I must say that I loved her dearly. Her thoughts and emotions and the inner workings of her mind just seemed so relatable and true to what someone would actually experience in those situations. I feel like I was really able to understand her character, and appreciate her even more for it. She was kind, and strong, and generous, and funny, but with a backbone that was rock solid.

Her mother's handwriting on the lined notepaper is so familiar, and the slight German accent Mali hears ticking through her words, so haunting.Mali reads the memories of her mother's Jewish childhood in 1930s Berlin, then her life in war-torn London.

  When Martin McKenna was growing up in Garryowen, Ireland, in the 1970s, he felt the whole world knew him as just that stupid boy.” Badly misunderstood by his family and teachers, Martin escaped from endless bullying by running away from home and eventually adoptingor being adopted bysix street dogs. Camping out in barns, escaping from farmers, and learning to fend for himself by caring for his new friends, Martin discovered a different kind of language, strict laws of behavior, and strange customs that defined the world of dogs. More importantly, his canine companions helped him understand the vital importance of family, courage, and self-respectand that he wasn’t stupid after all. Their lessons helped Martin make a name for himself as the Dog Man” in Australia, where he now lives and dispenses his hard-earned wisdom to dog owners who are sometimes baffled by what their four-legged friends are trying to tell them.An emotional and poignant story seasoned with plenty of Frank McCourtstyle humor, The Boy Who Talked to Dogs is an inspiration to anyone who’s ever been told he or she won’t amount to anything. It’s also a unique, fascinating look into canine behavior. In these pages, Martin shows how modern life has conditioned dogs to act around humans, in some ways helpful, but in other ways unnatural to their true instincts, and how he has benefited enormously from learning to talk dog.”   Read more  ","['5.0 out of 5 stars', '5.0 out of 5 stars', '4.0 out of 5 stars', '5.0 out of 5 stars']","['\nSurprising.\n', '\nGood summer book\n', '\nVery enlightening\n', '\nPage turner\n']","['\n\n  This is an amazing true story.

  From New York Times Bestselling Author, Penelope Douglas, comes the latest New Adult romance... ""We were perfect together. Until we met.""  Misha I can't help but smile at the lyrics in her letter. She misses me. In fifth grade, my teacher set us up with pen pals from a different school. Thinking I was a girl, with a name like Misha, the other teacher paired me up with her student, Ryen. My teacher, believing Ryen was a boy like me, agreed. It didn't take long for us to figure out the mistake. And in no time at all, we were arguing about everything. The best take-out pizza. Android vs. iPhone. Whether or not Eminem is the greatest rapper ever... And that was the start. For the next seven years, it was us. Her letters are always on black paper with silver writing. Sometimes there's one a week or three in a day, but I need them. She's the only one who keeps me on track, talks me down, and accepts everything I am.  We only had three rules. No social media, no phone numbers, no pictures. We had a good thing going. Why ruin it? Until I run across a photo of a girl online. Name's Ryen, loves Gallo's pizza, and worships her iPhone. What are the chances? F*ck it. I need to meet her. I just don't expect to hate what I find. Ryen He hasn't written in three months. Something's wrong. Did he die? Get arrested? Knowing Misha, neither would be a stretch. Without him around, I'm going crazy. I need to know someone is listening. It's my own fault. I should've gotten his phone number or picture or something. He could be gone forever. Or right under my nose, and I wouldn't even know it. *Punk 57 is a stand alone New Adult romance. It is suitable for ages 18+.

This was my very first read within the ""bully romance"" genre, and I wasn\'t sure how I would feel about it.  As someone who was bullied quite a lot growing up, I couldn\'t fathom the idea of falling for your tormentor.  But Punk 57 by Penelope Douglas changed that for me, and I finally understood.The past two days has been a back and forth between my and my sister, me texting her variations of ""WTF?!?"" several times as I read through this novel.  Misha - the tortured bad boy who doesn\'t care about fitting in, only about being himself.  Ryen - the closet geek and timid girl who hides behind a cruel facade and cares far too much about fitting in.  My heart broke and jumped into my throat on several occasions as I glared, teared up, laughed, and even bared my teeth once or twice at my Kindle.Misha and Ryen find solace and comfort in each other for 7 years whilst never meeting, only communicating via good old fashioned snail mail.  The way they torture and torment each other throughout the book stole my breath away, her trying to show off for her friends while he\'s trying with everything in his power to find the girl he knows and loves beneath the mask.It\'s heart breaking, thought provoking, gut wrenching, and raw.  Two people who would probably never associate under normal circumstances coming together and sifting through the lies to finally figure out who they are.Now I could go on for hours, but it would give the entire book away, and I really encourage you to read it.  But please, I am begging you - be kind to one another.  If someone is down, try to lift them back up.  You don\'t need to be cruel to gain attention - you simply need to be you.  Throughout this book, I kept thinking of a quote from a movie that I\'ve always loved, so I\'m going to leave you with it to mull over.""Why are you trying so hard to fit in when you were born to stand out?""  - Ian Wallace, What a Girl Wants\n\n', '\n\n  I loved everything about the is book. I’ve had it on my TBR for forever and finally dove in, I was not disappointed! Falling for someone solely based off of their words, having that one person you can tell all of your hopes,dreams and fears to, without judgement was a beautiful thing. Mesha and Ryen were perfectly imperfect, their ups and downs, their secrets and lies kept me hanging on their every word. Loved this book!\n\n', '\n\n  Angst, sexual tension on the precipice of exploding, and emotionally damaging pasts that lead to brooding teenagers… This book is the perfect blend of anguish and self discovery. I loved every single minute of it. It captured me from the start and didn’t let go even well after I finished.What starts out as a school pen pal mixup from unique names turns into a year long friendship through letters in the mail. These two have only ever communicated through written words, yet somehow created a bond that could never be broken… until one night it is broken. When Misha stops writing, Ryen is slowly losing it. Trying to adjust to a life without her letters is a difficult road, and no matter what happens with others in her life, she can never stop thinking of Misha. Misha has been scarred and has to work through his issues. He doesn’t have time to deal with Ryen, yet somehow keeps finding himself around her and it’s hard to stay away…Can these two figure everything out going on with themselves, each other, and the other factors all around them? Every time I thought I figured things out in the book, another twist came. I was on my toes the whole time, it’s one of the books I was up at 2am reading because I. Couldn’t. Put. It. Down. I need to own a copy of this book, it’s getting added to the TBBL.\n\n', ""\n\n  I read this in one sitting as I do most books that get heavy on my mind and heart because I don't like carrying the weight around if I procrastinate reading it.I didn't expect this book to be a hard read for me because of people raving how spicy it was bit but it was. Bullying tropes really get under my skin and I went in blind reading this so I didn't know that was gonna be the case. It took me until about 25% of the book to even start getting comfortable but after that the story flowed a little bit better for me.Though through the little sniffles I had and an almost mental break down reliving my own pain through Ryen, I appreciated how flawed she was and how she persevered through everything that happened and of course her beautiful relationship with Misha... the light of this book. He was flawed but also all sorts of wonderful.This book got me typing a review (which I seldom do) at 6am with no sleep says it all.This book was the good kind of pain and I loved it.\n\n"", '\n\n  ""We were perfect for each other. Until we met.""Sometimes you read a book blurb and the book doesn\'t live up to your expectations at all. Then there are those books that the blurb gives you just enough to get you interested and then the book is such more than you expected that you just let it completely consume you. Then when it ends your feelings are a big mumble jumbled mess and you wish you had savored it more. That is this book to a T. Don\'t be put off by it being high school because it is so much more!!\n\n', '\n\n  Punk 57 was my first PD read and it did not disappoint.Misha and Ryen have been pen pals since fifth grade and have never met, but when they do…“We were perfect together. Until we met”This book was the perfect enemies to love, bully romance. Once I started it, I couldn’t put it down.I’ve heard so many people say that PD’s books were next level spice and they weren’t wrong.I loved this story, I loved the characters and I loved the mystery.Misha and Ryen’s chemistry was INTENSE and I loved how their relationship started off so innocent through their letters but once they came face to face it was instant angst.I’ve now read many of Penelope Douglas’s book and I can truly say they are all incredible but this one hit different and will always have a special place in my heart.\n\n']"

It’s been a while since I’ve had a book do this and I loved it.The first half continually ramped up then it slowed down a little bit and picked up right until the end. I was trying to figure out how this book would lead into a second book because it kind of seemed like things were being tied up. Then there were multiple surprises and plays on emotions within the last few pages and you know book 2 is going to be a whole new adventure.We learn a decent amount about the female main character, River. I’m sure will delve a little bit more within the next book. Although the book was multiple points of view, we were only given glimpses of the men, enough to make you very curious.

Penelope constantly keeps you on edge with action, steam, and mystery. Her story telling was done phenomenally in this novel, everything was written with precision and the pace was absolutely perfect for this novel.————————————————————————-This is a novel I can’t say much about because I dont want to ruin it for others. I posted the other day stating that this novel was a “triangle” and I was definitely wrong. Its something alright, but a triangle it is not. The connections between the characters in this novel is like no other that I have ever read. Its an un-explainable relationship that grabs your heart and twists. Some of the events between characters was incredibly shocking; but hell, it was so so good. I was left with my mouth agape at multiple points during this novel. Just when I thought I was on a roll, I was thrown in a loop. The characters are so multi-dimensional and I loved, LOVED getting to know Tiernan, Jake, Noah, and Kaleb.————————————————————————-Also, if your looking for a read that will give you the perfect steam, this is it. I love steam in a novel, its one of my favourite parts of Romance and Penelope KILLED it.————————————————————————-This novel was hypnotic, intoxicating, and honestly Romantic. I highly recommend this novel. You wont regret it.————————————————————————-I would rate this novel a 5📖\n\n', '\n\n  I won’t say much in this review, since it is a book that should NOT be spoiled whatsoever! Like the synopsis hints at, it ends in a HEA. The synopsis makes sense after only a few chapters. We start realizing who has her, who wants her, and who is determined to keep her.Jake plays a larger part in the first half than he does in the end bit, but boy, does he heat up the pages from the very beginning. Although Noah too knows how to use his words, I was never a fan. HIs personality is too brotherly. Kaleb is the dark character we all love to read about. My heart broke and grew for him.They all have unique interactions with Tiernan that needed to happen. I wish I could say more, but I won’t. I think despite the topic the author introduces, she did it well and in a way that showed that it needed to happen before the end of the book. She didn’t hold back in this one and it definitely worked for her.Another 5 star read from Penelope Douglas!\n\n', '\n\n  I never knew what to expect with this novel. Penelope really out did her self with all of the twists and turns. I truly love her work! There is going to be a lot of controversy about all of the taboo content and I’m still not sure how I truly feel about everything in this novel. But that is also what made it such a good read. It makes you digger deeper and even after finishing the novel your left wondering about how you really feel about the whole work. I love that although this is 100% a steamy novel, there is so much more too it then anyone can image by just reading the back of the book! I can’t wait for Penelope’S next standalone!\n\n', '\n\n  This book is the first I’ve read by Penelope Douglas and so far it’s been a 10/10 read. I started reading it for the erotic behaviours between characters and stayed for the story line this book literally takes you and drags you into the story so much so it’s very hard to put the book down once you’ve started. Absolutely love it!\n\n', ""\n\n  I heard mixed reviews on this book so I was hesitant to read it, but I couldn't put it down.

Despite that I stuck with it, which I’m very glad for as this book pulled on all of my heart strings. Definitely recommend if you haven’t already read the book!!

  Is it ever too late to leave the friend zone?Hi, my name is Bree Camden, and I’m hopelessly in love with my best friend and star quarterback Nathan Donelson (as is half of America, judging by the tabloids and how much the guy dates). The first step is admitting, right? Except I can never admit it to him because he clearly doesn’t see me that way, and the last thing I want is for things to get weird between us.Nothing but good old-fashioned, no-touching-the-sexiest-man-alive, platonic friendship for us! Everything is exactly how I like it! Yes. Good. (I’m not crying, I’m just peeling an onion.)Our friendship is going swimmingly until I accidentally spill my beans to a reporter after too much tequila, and now the world seems to think Nathan and I belong together. Oh, and did I mention we have to date publicly for three weeks until after the Super Bowl because we signed a contract with...oops, forgot I can’t tell anyone about that!Bottom line is, now my best friend is smudging all the lines and acting very un-platonic, and I’m just trying to keep my body from bursting into flames every time he touches me. How am I going to make it through multiple weeks of fake dating Nathan without anything changing between us? Especially when it almost-sorta-kinda seems like he’s fighting for a completely different outcome?Send help.XO BreeThe Cheat Sheet is a closed-door, sizzling-with-chemistry, romantic comedy that will have you laughing and rooting for these lovable best friends from the first page!

  From the number-one bestselling author of The Nightingale and The Great Alone comes a powerful American epic about love and heroism and hope, set during the Great Depression, a time when the country was in crisis and at war with itself, when millions were out of work and even the land seemed to have turned against them. “My land tells its story if you listen. The story of our family.”Texas, 1921.  A time of abundance.  The Great War is over, the bounty of the land is plentiful, and America is on the brink of a new and optimistic era.  But for Elsa Wolcott, deemed too old to marry in a time when marriage is a woman’s only option, the future seems bleak.  Until the night she meets Rafe Martinelli and decides to change the direction of her life.  With her reputation in ruin, there is only one respectable choice: marriage to a man she barely knows.By 1934, the world has changed; millions are out of work and drought has devastated the Great Plains. Farmers are fighting to keep their land and their livelihoods as crops fail and water dries up and the earth cracks open.  Dust storms roll relentlessly across the plains.  Everything on the Martinelli farm is dying, including Elsa’s tenuous marriage; each day is a desperate battle against nature and a fight to keep her children alive.In this uncertain and perilous time, Elsa—like so many of her neighbors—must make an agonizing choice: fight for the land she loves or leave it  behind and go west, to California, in search of a better life for her family.The Four Winds is a rich, sweeping novel that stunningly brings to life the Great Depression and the people who lived through it—the harsh realities that divided us as a nation and the enduring battle between the haves and the have-nots.  A testament to hope, resilience, and the strength of the human spirit to survive adversity, The Four Winds is an indelible portrait of America and the American dream, as seen through the eyes of one indomitable woman whose courage and sacrifice will come to define a generation.

It\'s all the same.""\n', '\nPerseverance\n']","['\n\n  I must admit that I am stranger to these type of pedastrian plot driven popular novels.  I loved the quasi historical fiction element of the Dust Bowl migration outling the classist inhumane treatment of migrants in their own  country.  This is despicable and although no where even close to the abomination  of slavery, we do get to see the areas where classism and racism have similarities.My problem with the novel is that is so simplistic. I suppose this author knows her audience and clearly it is not me.The portrayal of the Italian American family alerted me immediately to the many flaws in this novel. Italians living in rural farming communities were not buying imported olive and the other stereotypical Italian foods. This part is just silly. These imported products would not have been readily available.Also, the idea that Italian parents would disown a SON and prefer his ""white"" girlfriend who shows up pregnant, is again very silly. Anyone who knows anything about Italian sons knows that their mothers never reject them in favour of pregnant white girls. The next thing about this is the casting of Italians as another race using expressions of ""dark"" and ""olive skinned.""  Italians are members of the white race and although they were cast as different and discriminated against for their culture, they were still white.As for the ""communist"" labour organizers there is nothing out of the ordinary about this, but it interesting to see reviews about how offensive any reference to communism is to some readers. One must remember this is before the realizations about totalitarian governments were very different than true Marxism.Now for our heroine, she is an OK character. She sacrifices everything for her family and the majority of women understand that deep love of one\'s children that permeates and consumes our lives.Overall, I could not finish this repetitive novel. It seems the author who I see churns these types of books out for her legion of fans, also just rehashes the same chapters over and over. It\'s like each new chapter is just a rewritten summary of the one before it. I was astounded she gets away with this to be honest in her attempt to churn out 400 pages... I must also add that the bedroom  scene near the end where Jack wants the ""lights on"" so he can ""see her"" made me laugh out loud. So hokey.This book is an attempt to write a Harlequin romance version of Grapes of Wrath.\n\n', ""\n\n  I grew up with a Dad who lived through the dirty 30s in Saskatchewan, where there are a lot of similarities in terms of what the dust storms, etc., were like.  Everything described in this book in regard to the weather matches the stories he told me.  I also read the Grapes of Wrath many years ago and this book reminded me of that, in terms of illustrating the despair of the people.  I found this book to be just stunning.  I learned a great deal about the migrant workers in California at the time.  I thought that Elsa was one of the most powerful females I've read in a book in recent memory.  The author did a beautiful job of depicting how Elsa finally found her voice.  Every bit of this book was believable.  Every character was living and breathing and speaking in my mind's eye.  I could hardly put it down and stayed up late last night because I simply had to finish it.  Yes, the subject matter is filled with despair and hopelessness, however, there is a thread of hope and positivity and strength that runs through the whole thing and saves it from being a depressing read.  This is a book I will likely read again and I expect I will find even more depth in each character when I do.\n\n"", ""\n\n  This excellent book about the Dust Bowl and the Great Depression has taken me back to my grandmother's stories about the era. After one year of COVID-19, this book showed me how this period, tragic as it is, pales in comparison to what the greatest generation endured for more than a decade.\n\n"", '\n\n  ""Be Brave... or pretend to be. It\'s all the same.""This is one of my favourite quotes in this inspiring, touching and eloquently written novel by Kristin Hannah.Elsa pretended to be brave her entire life, was quiet and at times subdued, until she was faced with her children\'s survival, and their future. Then she realized that she was brave.I gave this novel 4 stars, although it touched me deeply, and I did shed multiple tears throughout the time it took me to read it. It was a depressing tale, that during these dire times today, made me feel the ultimate sadness; for the people during the depression, for the Oakies, and for those during today\'s epic tales of struggle and despair.""Hope has taught me to stand up and find my woman\'s voice even in this mans world.""Elsa\'s character was always afraid to step out of her comfort zone, to do the inexplicable and to live and love a mundane life because that was all she knew, or that she thought she knew.She is a character to be admired, and unlike any character that I have known Hannah to write. She depicted Elsa as a true heroine in every sense of the word, her struggles with being a wife, being a mother, and being a woman were written in such a way that you were sentenced to sit back and reflect on your own struggles.As usual the imagery associated with Hannah\'s writing was second to none, as was her character definition, because every character in this novel is ultimately unforgettable.Another great one from Kristin Hannah.Thank you for writing this novel.\n\n', '\n\n  Someone on Good Reads suggested this was their favorite book, I must admit it wasn’t my favorite , nor was it her best in my opinion. I believe books come to us when we need them and had I read this during a different time in my life it might have meant more to me. That being said, it was well written and taught us about a part of history I’d never read much about before. It teaches us about hardships and how that makes us better people, slowly and almost without us realizing it . Elsa was a warrior in so many ways.\n\n']"

This kind of pattern always screws me up (I’m a one or two session reader, often just one!) and leaves me uncertain how I feel about a story. Enter, FOR THE WOLF.I liked so much of this but was equally confused by just as much. This is a story that I definitely need to reread because I think it’s possible this would be an easy four star if I had read it normally.There are shades of familiar fairytales woven into the roots of this spooky forest magic story. But these parts are made equally their own thing. This is not YA but is written with similar YA beats, yet manages to be dark without crossing any ‘can’t turn back now’ lines.While this had some absolutely lovely turns of phrase, a slowburn romance, and tons of forest aesthetic, I definitely lost track of some scenes or events as they played out, and I did find myself losing the thread of the worldbuiling (probably explained in the beginning and then just forgotten, because I’m dumb and was too slow to read this; though I also think the mythology is supposed to be uncertain and skewed and that doesn’t help?), but I am definitely going to be keen for the follow up.\n\n', '\n\n  “I’d let the world burn before I hurt you.”This adult, gothic reimagining of Little Red Riding Hood somehow reminded me of not just Little Red Riding Hood but also Beauty and the Beast and Snow White too. For the Wolf has all the things I need to get invested in a story. Retelling, romance, mystery, elemental magic, enchanted forest, complicated relationships - I got all these just from reading the first chapter.Fascinatingly twisted from the start, the mystery was more than enough to make me keep reading. I’ve always loved a story set in an enchanted forest/woodland and For the Wolf has all of what I loved and more with its magical world building. Played with the combination of myth, folklore and fairytale, a fantasy lover would love this story that has an eerie and spooky atmosphere.And while I fell in love with the theme of the story and its promising start, my feelings slowly changed mainly due to the excessive amount of exposition that left me confused at times. I also find conflicts that could have been resolved through proper communication is not my favorite.Perhaps because of the image that Little Red Riding Hood planted in my head, I expected more angst and banter from Red and Wolf. I got more interested with the secondary characters and I wish there was more of Raffe.I loved the setting and the overall aesthetic and I’m still interested to know what happens next because I’m definite that For the Wolf is just the beginning of a more twisted and darker world.Trigger Warnings provided by the author:-Self harm for magic use (cutting)-Parental neglect/emotional abuse-Mentions of physical symptoms that might be triggering to those with emetophobia-Anxiety/panic attacks-Parental death-Gore-Mild audio/visual hallucinations-Religious abuse-Medium-heat romance (non-explicit)\n\n', '\n\n  This is a dark, richly imagined world where the Big Bad Wolf isn’t exactly what you were always told.It’s a world where the First Daughter is for the Throne, the Second Daughter is for the Wolf, and the Wolf is for the Wilderwood.Twin sisters Red and Neve are devastated that soon Red will be sent to the Wilderwood forest as a sacrifice to the Wolf. Legend has it that the Wolf demanded that payment in exchange for keeping the monsters of the forest at bay. The people also want the Five Kings back, and they hope that this human sacrifice will appease the Wolf enough to free them. When Red arrives at the forest she discovers that her knowledge of the Wilderwood and the Wolf are mostly tall tales and soon she will have to harness her mysterious and budding powers to save her world.This novel has the classic dark and brooding male love interest, the heroine who doesn’t need any man to save her, and a few evil villains added to the mix. It is a slowly paced tale with rich detail that never feels like information overload. I prefer fantasy with well-developed characters over heavy plot and world-building. This book struck a nice balance between fully imagined characters and a forest that literally comes alive.I took one star off because, sometimes, I found the plot dragged. The romance wasn’t for me, but I’m sure others will enjoy it.Still, I can’t wait for the sequel!\n\n', ""\n\n  This came up as a suggestion at my local public library... I'm glad I took it.- It's modern twist on some older fairy tales... Yeah, the plot is kind of predictable (good vs evil), but eh! it's a fairy tale, not a thriller. Just turn your brain off and enjoy the story and try to imagine the scenery.Looking forward to her next book ;-)\n\n"", '\n\n  I love, love, loved this book. The characters are dynamic and tortured, the imagery rich and beautiful. There is also fantastic interplay between politics and religion and myth, compelling the reader to question what is good and evil and what just is. The bonds of obligation, love, and family tie this book together beautifully. I eagerly anticipating the next.\n\n', '\n\n  Loved this so much! Moody, broody and atmospheric - can’t wait for the next one! Hannah is a word wizard, this was so beautifully written.\n\n']"

The only person who can save me is Nero. We’re not friends. If he saw me drowning, he’d throw me an anchor.But he’s the only chance I’ve got.He’s no hero, he’s a Savage Lover.The Lark Notes:I like to call Savage Lover my “James Dean meets Fast and the Furious” novel. Nero is the ultimate Lothario. But Camille is so genuine and down-to-earth that she finds the soul inside the sinner.

As a member of the Gallo family – the Italian mafia, he’s a man of action and a risk-taker with a devil-may-care attitude and a well-earned reputation for getting into trouble.  I loved Camille!  She was hard working, feisty, smart and quick with a clever comeback when taunted with insults meant to belittle her.  I enjoyed how Nero and Camille first connected through their mutual love of classic cars.  As a mechanic herself, she truly was the rare female who could keep him intrigued outside of the bedroom.  As a couple these two were drawn together like steel to a magnet forming a tight connection through their similar life experiences.While this story is a bit of a departure from the chaos and vengeful scheming we’ve witnessed in the previous tales, it does contain some violence along with plenty of drama, action, adventure and suspense.  I didn’t find the romance particularly dark though, despite some intense chemistry and several seriously steamy encounters.I received a free copy of this book via Hidden Gems and am voluntarily leaving a review.\n\n', '\n\n  This is book three in the Brutal Birthright series. Wow, Nero is full of surprises, the man has some layers to him. How much good can be inside the son of the Italian mafia? Camille is a complex character herself, she is a good girl but she appears to have a little darkness inside as well. Nero and Camille bring out mostly the best out of one another, even when they banned together to commit a crime. I sat down to get started on this book and looked at the clock, two hours had already past! This book will pull you in immediately, it contains twists and turns that drive the story forward and challenge the characters. Nero and Camille figure out they make a good team while they also find themselves in an unlikely but steamy relationship. Enjoy this amazing book!

One being racing, I was a tomboy growing up and loved to race, so this was kind of right up my alley. Nero is the third son of the Gallo crime family and he's been around. Not one girl had captured his attention until he chanced upon Camille. They seemed to keep running into one another at different times. I really suggest you grab this one, you don't have to read the previous two in this series, but I would recommend that you do, this series is amazing. I can not wait for the next one. Way to go Sophie, keep up the great work.I voluntarily reviewed an advanced reader copy of this book via BookSprout.\n\n""]"

This just shows you how loyal and mature Lukas and Ivy really are. Lukas & Ivy have their up and down moments.  I love the OW and YM theme. v\n\n', '\n\n  Lukas and Ivy are such a great couple. I love the connection they share. The book was entertaining and had good depth to it. There was love, sadness, and heartache. This was the first book I read from the Ashes and Embers series, I’ll definitely be checking out the other books.\n\n', '\n\n  I cannot say enough good things about this exceptional author and extraordinary series. Lukas stole my heart and I know so many women that could relate with Ivy. The atmosphere of this town is so captivating that I find myself daydreaming of living there. I will definitely be reading all of this authors books.\n\n', '\n\n  This is very good.  I love the hero even though he is young he is very mature and loyal.  I like everything about this story except the ending.  I dont understand how suddenly the author will insert the baby and ended it that way.  I expected a happy reconciliation in the epilogue but instead i got a cliffhanger.  I cant believe how the heroes keep on having unwanted babies when they say they are always wearing protection when they have sex. It doesnt make sense and inconsistent. I felt cheated in the end.\n\n']"

  Wall Street Journal bestsellerWatch your most innovative ideas take flight by overcoming the forces that resist change The Human Element is for anyone who wants to introduce a new idea or innovation into the world. Most marketers, innovators, executives, activists, or anyone else in the business of creating change, operate on a deep assumption. It is the belief that the best (and perhaps only) way to convince people to embrace a new idea is to heighten the appeal of the idea itself. We instinctively believe that if we add enough value, people will eventually say ""yes."" This reflex leads us down a path of adding features and benefits to our ideas or increasing the sizzle of our messaging - all in the hope of getting others on board. We call this instinct the ""Fuel-based mindset."" The Fuel-based mindset explains so much of what we do, from adding countless trivial features to software, to bolting a sixth blade onto a shaving razor. By focusing on Fuel, innovators neglect the other half of the equation – the psychological Frictions that oppose change. Frictions create drag on innovation. And though they are rarely considered, overcoming these Frictions is essential for bringing new ideas into the world. The Human Element highlights the four Frictions that operate against innovation. Readers will discover:  Why their best ideas and initiatives often get rejected – despite their undeniable value How to disarm the forces of resistance that act against change How to transform the very Frictions that hold us back into catalysts for change  Perfect for business leaders, product managers, educators, and anyone else who seeks to bring new and exciting ideas to life, The Human Element is an indispensable resource to help people overcome the powerful forces of human nature that instinctively resist change.

They do all the work to make the bride’s day perfect. They follow along with the bride’s wishes and deal with the mounting pressure of the big day. The focus is always on the bride. Nina Manning’s, “The Bridesmaid,” mirrors this relationship in an unlikely friendship between two girls.Sasha first met Caitlin at Saxby House when they were children. Sasha’s parents work for the Clemonte’s on their estate. The girls were besties, inseparable, until the day Sasha has had enough. Enough of having to do things Caitlin’s way. Enough of putting up with Caitlin’s odd behaviour. Enough of the secrets.This novel is about toxic relationships and explores the reason behind these types of friendships. A slow burner, and more a mystery than a thriller, you’ll discover that nothing is as it seems. Like the one on the cover, a rose is beautiful to look at and has a beautiful aroma. However, every rose has its thorn and this rose, the bride, has a few. In an attempt to keep secrets for appearance's sake, people fail to connect with the most important people around them - thus perpetuating the problem. This is the bridesmaid’s story from the beginning of the friendship to the end of it.The author studied psychology and applied it to the relationships in this book. It’s a decades-long journey into why people behave the way they do. It’s a unique read because, for most of the book, the main characters are teenagers. Most psychological thrillers I’ve read have adult protagonists.I was gifted this advance copy by Nina Manning, Boldwood Books and NetGalley and was under no obligation to provide a review.\n\n"", '\n\n  I was unsure what to rate this. I really enjoyed this book and got sucked into it and boy was it ever a readable page turner...BUT it was not a thriller...not by my definition. This was more like a dramatic chick lit story with a bit of a mystery thrown in and I really liked it.The plot was interesting and I loved the format of before and now. It is told from the singular point of view and you really got to know the two main characters because of that. I really appreciate Nina Mannings writing style and the way she keeps you wanting to know more. The whole time I was reading this I kept saying to myself ""just one more chapter"".

Most of the story was a slow build towards what I was hoping would be a carefully constructed surprise ending, but instead the last portion seemed rushed and more telling than showing. So great concept but the execution left something to be desired. But then again, I am picky. For readers who are just looking for a good distraction during pandemic lockdown or a distracting beach read, they'll like this. For those interested in authentic characters, clean story line and aha ending, not so much.\n\n"", '\n\n  3.25 stars. This was my first time reading a Nina Manning book and I think it was a good starting place!Sasha moves to the grand estate of Saxby Hall with her parents where they have recently been employed. Not long after moving in Sasha meets Caitlin, the privileged, wealthy, and mercurial daughter of the Clemonte family. The pair become fast friends and Sasha finds herself doing anything to maintain her friendship with Caitlin and to keep her happy. Fast forward about twenty years and Sasha, still the supportive friend, is meticulously planning Caitlin’s wedding to their childhood friend Chuck. As the wedding approaches, things start veering off course.The story is told from Sasha’s perspective during two timelines: when the girls are teens; and later, in their thirties. The chapters are short, which makes it easy to keep flipping the pages.This was a solid thriller, a bit slow at times, but one that I was still compelled to stay up late reading. I don’t know how I feel about the ending. I guess I was hoping for something more explosive to the tension that had been building. It did resolve things nicely, so there’s that. And it certainly changed my perception of some of the characters!Thanks to Netgalley and Boldwood Books for providing me with this ARC in exchange for my honest opinions.\n\n', '\n\n  I found it interesting from the moment I started it until the very end.

I was delighted therefore when I discovered it was on sale for $1.99 and promptly picked it up. And it is worth every good worth every good review it’s received and now I’m adding mine to the rest. It’s a delightful enemies to lovers romance.Lucy and Joshua are two executive assistants who sit side by side each working for a different CEO of a merged publishing company and right from the first day things have been strained. Lucy is a friendly, delightful young woman who is loved by everyone and Joshua isn’t. The first day they met Lucy smiled at him and Joshua ignored her and it’s been war between the two ever since. They are constantly trying to one up the other and their battles are delightfully written. I think I smiled through this entire book. There are so many cute moments in the book from where Lucy speed walks to keep up with Joshua on their way to the kitchen to them both going to HR about the other. The book is told entirely from Lucy’s POV so we don’t get why Joshua is such a jerk to her until later in the book and then are hearts start to melt and we all fall in love with him.There are so many already positive reviews for this book and I’m trying to keep this short so I’ll just finish up with read this book. It’s still only $2.99 and that’s a great price for something you are going to love.\n\n', '\n\n  Okay I’ve heard SO MUCH about this book and Joshua Templeton that I had to check this out for myself. 25% into the book and I was very confused. THIS is what everyone is flapping on about?? 50% into the book and I see the chemistry. But these two characters are so juvenile. It’s like watching wild animals mate. Biting and snipping at each other while getting it on. Where is the romance?? 75% into the story and I still don’t understand what the hell is really going on. It wasn’t until the last bloody chapter that we finally get any real headway into these characters and they are still holding back. I wanted to throw Josh’s ribbon pillow in my face and scream GROW UP!!! GAWD!!!! I’ll admit the way Josh takes care of Lucy is adorable and the way he can tell by a look in her face if she is freaking out. But he could have saved them both a whole lot of time if he just ask her out for pity sake.\n\n', '\n\n  From the very first chapter, I knew this wasn’t a typic  as l romcom. Sally Thorne has s literary style of writing that I’ve rarely encountered in the genre. It’s magically soothing and intoxicating all together.

Thank you!\n\n', '\n\n  I have this book in paperback and on my ereader, so that I will always have it no matter where I am.  That’s how much I love it.  It is so good that I re-read it constantly and then I laugh loudly by myself at all the funny parts even though I know they’re going to happen.  And don’t get me started about Josh Templeman.... I want him to hold back my hair when I vomit ( you’ll understand this if you read the book) and who doesn’t love a guy who saves her lipstick kissed Post-it note and sticks it on his fridge, right?  I had no chance.  Neither do you... read this book... and you’re welcome!\n\n', ""\n\n  I enjoyed it from start to finish.

Would definarely recommend to friends and maybe if I'm feeling nice lend mine!\n\n"", '\n\n  Okay i give up on books easily but this one had me blushing and tearing up i love Joshua and Lucy’s chemistry and relationship development. To me, they are soulmates, and it’s a beautiful romantic journey. I love this book im so glad i read it, just a lovely read and ending. SPICY content. Joshua has certainly raised my standards in men….i recommend!\n\n', '\n\n  This was a gem of a book!  I had just finished ""Whisper Network"" and needed something a little light and not so much work to read.  ""The Hating Game"" was a super fast read as you just couldn\'t put it down as it moved nicely and quickly and had a great story line.  Loved the characters and could for sure see this as a movie.

She's not the experienced Irish maid who was hired to work in one of Pittsburgh's grandest households. She's a poor farmer's daughter with nowhere to go and nothing in her pockets. But the woman who shares her name has vanished, and assuming her identity just might get Clara some money to send back home.Clara must rely on resolve as strong as the steel Pittsburgh is becoming famous for and an uncanny understanding of business, attributes that quickly gain her Carnegie's trust. But she still can't let her guard down, not even when Andrew becomes something more than an employer. Revealing her past might ruin her future—and her family's.With captivating insight and heart, Carnegie's Maid is a book of fascinating 19th century historical fiction.

It interweaves Clara Kelly\'s fictional story to that of ""Andrew Carnegie\'s transformation from ruthless industrialist into the world\'s first true philanthropist.""The focus of this story is really Clara\'s life - she was shipped from Galway, Ireland to America, in hope of finding a job in service or in a factory; allowing her to send her earnings back home to help support her family who are still suffering the effects of the Irish potato famine. Instead, she lands a job in the Carnegie household, an error in identity providing her with a way out of poverty.What follows are ""journal type"" entries (not a formal journal, but all in the first person narrative and dated) of her life with the Carnegies. We get a glimpse into what shaped Andrew Carnegie\'s work-ethic, his relationship with his mother and brother Tom, and we also get a sense of his belief that all people are created equal and deserve the chance to a better life. Clara\'s relationship with Andrew is that of not only romantic interest (all very proper), but also an intellectual one. In her, he finds a sounding board to his ideas, and was challenged by her own ideas.Clara was a well developed character. Perhaps it was a little far-fetched to believe that Andrew Carnegie would have sought out the opinion and advice of his mother\'s lady\'s maid, but their relationship was lovely to watch unfold.This is not a book that is full of tension, nor does it have a ""mysterious twist"". This is simply a well written story of what ""might have been""/ ""could have been"". The entire thing was written in a way that transported the reader to Pittsburgh during the American Civil War, and brought to light what was happening in Ireland at the same time.Well written, highly enjoyable. A book in which you can simply escape the reality of the every day.Recommended.\n\n', '\n\n  This book gave a look into the life of Irish immigrants who came to America for a better life.

The heat between the sheets and many other places was also very well written.  It didn’t seem like too much sex because like I said there was a well written story.

When Daisy finds herself marrying a stranger just 3 hours after hopping on the back of his bike, in hopes to save her job, she has no idea what’s to come. Including a cross country move to live with her mysterious fake husband. And real feelings she told herself wouldn’t happen in their no strings, 3 month marriage arrangement.Jude, move over. There’s a hotter brother in town. I don’t think I can say it enough times. I loved this hero. I loved him. I literally LOVED him. I have a hero type. It’s strong and silent. A man of few words. But means what he does say. Sweet and sexy. Attentive, in all the ways. But can dirty talk too. And that is Flynn to a tee. But where he is calm and cool as a cucumber, Daisy is a wild ball of nerves and restless energy! She did enough jabbering for the two of them and then some. But gosh did I love her too.These two had some serious chemistry. And it gets HOT. Some of the sexy scenes fade out, but even the ones that do are sexy. The newspaper scene for one... (*fans self* thinking about it). That scene will live rent free in my head thank you very much. The humour really had me. The way the authors described scenes, like the ‘grinch’ one, had me cracking up. These brothers, and their hilarious antics, I couldn’t help but enjoy. There were some really sweet moments as well. That epilogue had me laughing and crying. It was perfectly beautiful.At times it felt young (which I typically don’t like) but I had so much fun reading this, I didn’t care. I really loved it. And I look forward to reading more from these sexy brothers! Though it’s going to be tough to beat my love for Flynn.

Some part of me offered to save her because, deep down, I knew she’d save me.”\n\n', '\n\n  For those unfamiliar with the name of the author, they state, ‘A secret duo of romance authors team up under the pseudonym Max Monroe to bring you a sexy, laugh-out-loud new series…& more. ;)  Writing partners and long time friends, Max and Monroe strive to live and write all the fun, sexy swoon so often missing from their Facebook newsfeed. Sarcastic by nature, their two writing souls feel like they’ve found their other half.’One of the many aspects of the authors’ writing skills is the degree of humor that they infuse steamy erotica. The language is a bit overdone in the potty mouth category, but it fits the story just fine. Naughty all the way .A tease of their sparkling writing skills follows as we meet Flynn: “The four Winslow brothers in Vegas. What could go wrong? Ha. Pretty much every-[expletive]–thing can go wrong when all three of my brothers decided a boozy brunch to start the day was a grand idea. Although, so far, their drunken sins revolve around stumbling steps and being a little too loud for the early afternoon casino crowd, but my track record of knowing them my entire life predicts this day to be one hell of a chaotic rife. Says the bastard who always chooses to be the responsible sober brother of the group.’’The plot is summarized as follows, from Daisy’s vantage: “I need a ride,” I said to a sexy stranger on a Harley. Three hours later? A six-foot-tall Marilyn Monroe was officiating our Vegas wedding at the Happy Chapel. But it’s not love—it’s business—a marriage pact made out of desperation so my career doesn’t go up in flames.

I wish it were as easy as telling myself,  Do not fall in love with your fake husband, Daisy, but apparently, when feelings get involved, not everything that happens in Vegas knows how to stay in Vegas.’It is a rollercoaster ride sparkling with erotica and guffaws. Enjoy a naughty outing in Vegas! Grady Harp, November 21\n\n', '\n\n  I laughed, I cried, I laughed some more.  I loved this book.  It’s one of my fav reads. This is the second book in the Winslow Brothers series about Flynn.  He is known as the quiet one.  He keeps to himself and doesn’t speak unless it is necessary but he’s a good guy, loyal and intelligent and a gorgeous alpha.  Daisy is pretty much the opposite- a bit of a scattered brain, bubbly, friendly but still as successful and beautiful inside and,out.  I absolutely loved their banter and smiled and laughed often.  This story warmed my heart.  I voluntarily received an a gorgeous complete arc copy from the author with thanks.\n\n']"

  “Delightful . . . [a] captivating and slyly subversive fictional paean to the real women whose work on the Oxford English Dictionary went largely unheralded.”—The New York Times Book Review WINNER OF THE AUSTRALIAN BOOK INDUSTRY AWARD • “A marvelous fiction about the power of language to elevate or repress.”—Geraldine Brooks, New York Times bestselling author of People of the BookEsme is born into a world of words. Motherless and irrepressibly curious, she spends her childhood in the Scriptorium, an Oxford garden shed in which her father and a team of dedicated lexicographers are collecting words for the very first Oxford English Dictionary. Young Esme’s place is beneath the sorting table, unseen and unheard. One day a slip of paper containing the word bondmaid flutters beneath the table. She rescues the slip and, learning that the word means “slave girl,” begins to collect other words that have been discarded or neglected by the dictionary men. As she grows up, Esme realizes that words and meanings relating to women’s and common folks’ experiences often go unrecorded. And so she begins in earnest to search out words for her own dictionary: the Dictionary of Lost Words. To do so she must leave the sheltered world of the university and venture out to meet the people whose words will fill those pages. Set during the height of the women’s suffrage movement and with the Great War looming, The Dictionary of Lost Words reveals a lost narrative, hidden between the lines of a history written by men. Inspired by actual events, author Pip Williams has delved into the archives of the Oxford English Dictionary to tell this highly original story. The Dictionary of Lost Words is a delightful, lyrical, and deeply thought-provoking celebration of words and the power of language to shape the world.

A friend in Australia sent me a copy of this book as she thought I\'d enjoy it.  I didn\'t just enjoy it, I loved this book.  I loved Esme and her story,  I loved the words and it was interesting to learn how women\'s words (and women themselves) were invisible in the late 1800\'s and later.  This book is based on the Oxford English Dictionary and the work involved in making it and the people involved in the words.  Now that sounds quite dry and that is just the opposite of what the book was like.  A number of reviewers said the book was ""original"" and that is the perfect descriptor of this book.  The women who people this novel are extraordinary, even in their ordinariness.  Such a wonderful read.\n\n', '\n\n  When I was young and I asked my mother how to spell a word she would say “Look it up in the dictionary.” And I would reply I can’t because I can’t spell it.” This historical fiction covers the years 1886 to 1989 and significant events told through the words of Esme Nicoll.At age five she introduces us to the Oxford English Dictionary and how it is compiled, how decisions are made on what words are included and, more importantly, the words, mainly words related too and used by women are omitted. Her father is one of the associates and her first relationship with the dictionary’s workings is sitting under the work table and picking up the discarded slips.Esme becomes friends with an actress who introduces her to the world of the protesting suffragettes. Not a place where she is comfortable and she struggles with what actions in which she can become involved. This friendship leaves another major mark on Esme’s life.The third event is World War One which has a major impact of the progress of the dictionary as young men enlist. Her wedding to Gareth, a compositor with the Oxford University Press who is working on the dictionary takes place before he goes to the front. It also leads her to a new use of words and language working with soldiers who have lost the ability to speak as a result of what they suffered in battle.The dictionary is finally completed in November, 1928 and work has already started on the first of several supplements before the second edition is released in 1989. This is a historical novel for people who love words. The ending brought tears to my eyes.I don’t always read the Afterwords and Acknowledgments but in this case I urge you do so as the history of the dictionary continues. They identify the historical people and reinforce the true activities that are in the novel.Reviewed June 23, 2021\n\n']"

Did I mention that there’s only one double bed in Etienne’s cabin? Suffice it to say, Sam finally realizes he’s in love with his best friend.I really liked the plot in that falling in love with a best friend is one of my favourite tropes.

Sam and Etienne’s best-friends-to-lovers tale is sweet and satisfying, with just the right amount of heat.Set amid the world of figure skating and mostly at an upper-end ski resort in Quebec, Andrews makes the transition in their relationship adorably awkward and fun.  Sam’s bi-awakening was generally non-traumatic in all the best ways.Side characters add to the lightheartedness delightfully, especially Bree and Sam’s grandma.  Despite the characters’ inner turmoil, this is a low-angst, fun, romantic romp.The only downside (for me) is I feel this could have easily been a full-length novel, more fully developing the men’s friendship prior to them getting together.

  A biography examining the final days of Freddie Mercury in the dawn of AIDS and the legacy he left behind. For the first time, the final years of one of the world’s most captivating rock showman are laid bare. Including interviews from Freddie Mercury’s closest friends in the last years of his life, along with personal photographs, Somebody to Love is an authoritative biography of the great man. Here are previously unknown and startling facts about the singer and his life, moving detail on his lifelong search for love and personal fulfilment, and of course his tragic contraction of a then killer disease in the mid-1980s. Woven throughout Freddie’s life is the shocking story of how the HIV virus came to hold the world in its grip, was cruelly labelled “The Gay Plague” and the unwitting few who indirectly infected thousands of men, women and children—Freddie Mercury himself being one of the most famous. The death of this vibrant and spectacularly talented rock star, shook the world of medicine as well as the world of music. Somebody to Love finally puts the record straight and pays detailed tribute to the man himself. “Touts rare—and in some cases, never before seen—images of Mercury and new insight into his life.”—People “The book could be a standalone epidemiological study about the history of HIV/AIDS even without Mercury. But eventually, it weaves him into the timeline, giving a detailed account of his personal life, and his battle with the disease that tragically took him at age 45 in 1991.

Ava is young and still in college. She currently lives next door to her older brother who she’s very close with. Alex and Ava’s brother are best friends and went to college together. When Ava’s brother goes off Central America for a year, he asks Alex to keep an eye on Ava. In order to monitor Ava, Alex decides to move into his friend’s apartment so he’s right next door. That way he can still focus on his business while keeping tabs on Ava. Ava feels as though Alex unfeeling, so she bets her friends that she can get him to feel an array of emotions. There is a deep traumatic event that ties the two of them together and they discover it along with a love that neither of them was prepared for.There are not enough words to describe how amazing this book is. Sometimes a book comes along and it wrecks you in the best way possible. I was dreaming about this book for days after reading it. I ended up re-reading it (along with my favorite parts) over and over again. There were pieces to this mystery surrounding Ava’s past along with Alex that I didn’t see coming. The whole book itself felt like a blockbuster movie it was so good. Alex reminded me of the Grinch in a way where the one woman comes in and melts his ice cold heart and every day he’s around her it grows just a little bit more. There love and attraction wasn’t instant. Ava put in a lot of work when it came to her relationship with Alex and he was an alpha hole like no other. His possessiveness towards Ava should be chauvinistic but I found it utterly romantic. There is a big mystery surrounding the couple and there is a lot of new trauma as result. I like that the ending was hard won on Alex’s part and it didn’t end perfectly. It’s really hard to give an in-depth review without spoiling too much.This book will stay with you long after you read it. It will touch a piece of you that you didn’t know existed. I love reading romance novels and I read quite a few hundred each year. I can say without a doubt that this book is one of the best I’ve ever read. It’ll never forget it.\n\n', '\n\n  This book is a dark romance, full of steamy scenes and twists and turns. Alex is the cold, dominant, hot best friend to Josh, Ava’s brother. Ava is a optimistic, soft hearted woman, who tries to breakdown Alex’s barriers. Both Alex and Ava have a tormented past that seems to dictate their personalities. Slowly, they fall in love, but then their worlds explode and lead to their breakup. There is such heartbreak for both of them. I was rooting for them the entire way and finally they get their HEA.\n\n', '\n\n  A new author for me and I was pleasantly surprised.  Twisted love is a dark romance. The story is aboutAva and Alex.  This is a pair you want to root for.  Ava is beautiful inside and out.  Alex is an intense and dark.  Alex is Ava’s brother’s best friend.  He asks her to lookout for her when her brother goes to another country for school. They are attracted to each other and genuinely like each other and seem a good match. A few unexpected surprises and twists keep the story compelling.  I voluntarily received an arc copy of this book from HiddenGems\n\n', ""\n\n  Ava is sweet and good. She believes in the good of everyone. Complete opposite of Alex who is dark, and authoritative and dominant.The tension was off the charts for the first 3 quarters of the book. It lacked depth for me in the last quarter, but I was quickly reeled back in with those last few pages. Has a princess been naughty?Overall, an impressive standalone in a universe that I can't wait to dive deeper into!\n\n"", '\n\n  Once started to read this book I found it difficult to put down. I read it in one day. The hero,  Alex, is so complex that you could despise him one minute but several pages later you could like him. As for the heroine, Ava, she too has her own deep issues. You felt for her and all she has been through. It takes the both of them to have to work through a lot together to get to their “happy” place. Thoroughly enjoyed this book. Will have to read another Ana Huang book!\n\n', ""\n\n  When I saw that this book had grovelling, best friend's brother, grumpy/sunshine trope,a possessive male character (I can die for those lol) kinda forced proximity, a bed-sharing scene and great friend group, i downloaded this with speed. And it was being recommended all over booktok (I’m on there 24/7 that’s how I found it) so might as well read it.The dirty talking in this book is freaking top notch haha. I loved every part of it. There is a part in chapter 22 page 162, on kindle it says 1695 people have it highlighted. That part touched my spirit!!! Haha.The romance at the beginning of the book was cute. And the operation plan her and her friends had going on was also funny.But towards the end, it wasn’t as much I guess for me. There was more telling than showing. Most people also said that about it. I wouldn’t say it is fast paced but there rate it went from 0-100 was uhm…Although it’s a chill book, there are some TW.It’s a great FICTION book, I enjoyed his possessiveness. The dirty talking like I said is 💯.\n\n"", ""\n\n  I loved this book.  I loved the revenge schemes, the chemistry and how Ava was the light to Alex's darkness.\n\n""]"

Somewhere when I started this series with “The Girls Across The Bay” I read that it was book 1 of a trilogy but ala Douglas Adams “The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy” that reached at least 5 books I have now read book 4 of this trilogy and it has a big hint that book 5 is on the way and am I ever glad. As anyone who reads my reviews has surely noticed I am very stingy with 5 star ratings but this book grabbed me very early and just got better and better the farther I read and I kept telling myself if the author didn’t blow the ending this was going to be a 5 star rating. And what a solid ending it turned out to be! I could hardly imagine how Ms O’Brien was going to tie all of Madigan and Grace’s seemingly unrelated investigations together but somehow after so many twists and turns and false suspects everything came together in an absolutely logical conclusion and enough clues were delivered throughout the story that one should have been able to identify the perp but I admit I had one of the many suspects picked as the culprit and I was dead wrong. Through the earlier books in this series my opinion of Madigan and Grace has waffled back and forth from not liking them much to liking them quite a lot but always feeling a lot of empathy for them and in this book it started out a bit like that but I sure grew to really liking them at the end and I’m looking forward to another great investigation with them. BTW Mac has become a top notch character and possibly the best one in the book. Another big surprise was the ending of the Raven/Melanie subplot which again I never saw coming.

This a dark bully romance and TWs include attempted rape, physical abuse, sexual abuse, toxic masculinity, and just about any other TW you can think of. These are potentially harmful topics so if you are sensitive to any of these matters PLEASE educate yourself before reading.That being said, this author did a fantastic job of weaving all these topics through an exciting and sexy narrative. The story follows Rika Fane, a young woman whos finally about to spread her wings and make a name for herself, beyond the one she was born into and the people around her who do nothing but coddle her. But Rika knows she is so much more. And Michael Crist, a devilishly handsome and dangerous man has seen that fire in her eyes too. They've grown up together, orbiting around each other but never really making a move. Michael knows she likes to play the game and in her, he's found a formidable opponent. Amidst their whirlwind sexual escapades, through a narrative that alternates between present-day and 3 years prior, we discover how something that happened on Devil's Night 3 years ago (Halloween Eve) has changed Rika and Michael's lives forever, as well as Michael's friends Kai, Damon, and Will. Rika betrayed them all, and they demand revenge.This book is a roller coaster. You will find yourself loving and simultaneously hating every character. Rika is rash but she fights for what she wants. Michael has serious anger issues (for real I hope at the end of this book he goes to some therapy) but he's loyal till the end. His friends, however problematic they are and their desire to take what isn't theirs, are a product of the white rich American suburbs. I don't know if Douglas did this intentionally, but I found this book as almost a critique of toxic masculinity and its presence not only in high school but the world beyond those gated communities. Michael and his friends, for most of their lives, are able to evade any repercussions of their actions. They destroy and wreak havoc because they can. But in the end, your past always catches up with you.Truthfully, I enjoyed the romance. I won't apologize for liking a novel with problematic themes because I don't think that's fair. Its like kink (which btw this book has a lot of!!!), just because you enjoy it between the sheets doesn't mean you'll stand for it in the streets. But also, maybe you do and that's totally fine!! Either way, its ok to like books maybe society says you shouldn't. Reading is about pleasure and enjoyment, and this book definitely brought me that.The sex scenes were A1, probably the best I have ever read before. The building tension and romance were sickeningly delicious. If you're a fan of Douglas' other works or just dark smutty thriller romances in general.. you will devour this!\n\n"", '\n\n  🌟 🌟 🌟 🌟 🌟 (5/5 Stars)“𝑂𝑤𝑛 𝑖𝑡, 𝑜𝑟 𝑖𝑡 𝑤𝑖𝑙𝑙 𝑜𝑤𝑛 𝑦𝑜𝑢.“ - 𝐶𝑜𝑟𝑟𝑢𝑝𝑡 𝑏𝑦 𝑃𝑒𝑛𝑒𝑙𝑜𝑝𝑒 𝐷𝑜𝑢𝑔𝑙𝑎𝑠Do you ever buy a book and then hold off reading it for one reason or another and then you finally pick up the book and you’re kicking yourself for not having done it sooner? If so, then you understand me, because that is exactly what happened to me with Corrupt!!🤩Let me just say, this book is AMAZING!! 🙌🏻This was my first dark romance read and it was the perfect ice breaker into the dark romance trope! Corrupt, was dark and suspenseful, but not so dark that I was uncomfortable. Penelope balanced this book perfectly!👌🏻As soon as I picked up this book, I was hooked and became more and more enthralled as the book progressed!😍 Penelope seamlessly transitioned between past and present with this book, giving you just enough information to keep you guessing and at the edge of your seat without giving away too much. (Like I said, Pen kills it with the Balance in this book!)The world Penelope created with this book completely blows my mind, the whole concept is truly phenomenal and unique. The hero, Michael, and the heroine, Rika in this book were amazing! I loved the push and pull between them and the side characters omg I can’t wait for their books!\xa0 Also, if you guys like steamy scenes, this has one of the HOTTEST scenes I have ever read!!🔥🔥🔥\xa0If you like dark romance books, that keep you on the edge of you seat with twists, steam, and having your mind blown, I highly recommend this book!❤️\n\n', '\n\n  Book 1 in the Devil’s Night Series, the story of Michael and Rika.

Michael with the help of his friends Kai, Will and Damon who make up the group called the Horsemen just got out of jail and are about to set in motion the revenge plan on Rika who just happens to be the gal who betrayed them all on Devil’s Night sending 3 of the 4 of them to jail for three years.  This is a revenge plan years in the making.  I gave this book 4 Stars.\n\n', ""\n\n  Pretty unlikable characters. Found myself rolling my eyes at the antics of these spoiled rich kids with almost no discernable redeeming qualities. And omg wow is Rika ever slow on the uptake. That seems to be a trend with Pen's female main characters though.The past/present split way of telling the story was annoying at first but it got better towards the middle.The games they played with each other were pretty intriguing.  The sex scenes were minimal but pretty well written--definitely spank-bankable. Too bad there weren't more of them.Overall decent read.But if you're trying to figure out which Pen Douglas book to pick up first I would direct you to Credence.\n\n"", '\n\n  That book was pretty intense! I had to take a breath in between chaptersBut even though it got me all twisted up on the inside, this book was amazingI did not see the end coming like that.

All I can say is you have to read it to understand the dept of it\n\n', '\n\n  Intriguing, captivating and mysterious. I loved the back and forth between past and present, and Rika’s and Michael’s POV. Details are given so sparingly that the reader is kept guessing and wondering what happened that last night. Rika becomes a cunning adversary. Brilliant. Could NOT put this book down!I’ve never read this author before and I was seriously WOWED!\n\n', '\n\n  This was an amazing story. It was thrilling and I couldn’t stop reading until the end. I loved the characters and I loved that the heroine was strong and tough as nails and no one could take her down.

  #1 NEW YORK TIMES BESTSELLER • PULITZER PRIZE FINALIST • This inspiring, exquisitely observed memoir finds hope and beauty in the face of insurmountable odds as an idealistic young neurosurgeon attempts to answer the question What makes a life worth living? NAMED ONE OF PASTE’S BEST MEMOIRS OF THE DECADE • NAMED ONE OF THE BEST BOOKS OF THE YEAR BY The New York Times Book Review • People • NPR • The Washington Post • Slate • Harper’s Bazaar • Time Out New York • Publishers Weekly • BookPage Finalist for the PEN Center USA Literary Award in Creative Nonfiction and the Books for a Better Life Award in Inspirational MemoirAt the age of thirty-six, on the verge of completing a decade’s worth of training as a neurosurgeon, Paul Kalanithi was diagnosed with stage IV lung cancer. One day he was a doctor treating the dying, and the next he was a patient struggling to live. And just like that, the future he and his wife had imagined evaporated. When Breath Becomes Air chronicles Kalanithi’s transformation from a naïve medical student “possessed,” as he wrote, “by the question of what, given that all organisms die, makes a virtuous and meaningful life” into a neurosurgeon at Stanford working in the brain, the most critical place for human identity, and finally into a patient and new father confronting his own mortality. What makes life worth living in the face of death? What do you do when the future, no longer a ladder toward your goals in life, flattens out into a perpetual present? What does it mean to have a child, to nurture a new life as another fades away? These are some of the questions Kalanithi wrestles with in this profoundly moving, exquisitely observed memoir. Paul Kalanithi died in March 2015, while working on this book, yet his words live on as a guide and a gift to us all. “I began to realize that coming face to face with my own mortality, in a sense, had changed nothing and everything,” he wrote. “Seven words from Samuel Beckett began to repeat in my head: ‘I can’t go on. I’ll go on.’” When Breath Becomes Air is an unforgettable, life-affirming reflection on the challenge of facing death and on the relationship between doctor and patient, from a brilliant writer who became both.

In 'When Breath Becomes Air,' Kalanithi accounts his transition from his childhood and the path that drew him towards an initially unlikely career in medicine through the end of residency, and ultimately the tragic derailment of a once promising outlook. Beyond the difficulty of dealing with terminal illness, the author is able to find some answers about what it means to live a life fully, however imperfect it may be.As an aspiring doctor and having been impacted by a familial death from lung cancer around the time of my reading this, there are many passages in the story that resonated with me. At times it required me to put the book down to really process the feelings that I had, and to understand on a deep level the vulnerabilities we all experience as human beings. I will always appreciate the impact of Paul's story on my own maturing perspective.\n\n"", '\n\n  I don\'t normally write book reviews. But I am super compelled to write one.Paul\'s brave story of journeying through med-school and facing lung cancer, was so inspiring and real.The book is well-written, with a table-spoon of medical jargon (but made me feel intelligent nonetheless), and get\'s to the point without droning on irrelevant details.I personally think the book could have been longer and detailed more in his life as a neurologist and the challenges of the practice. However, his whole book was based on ""to what degree should we sustain life, if there isn\'t much quality or value of life remaining"".This is a must-read for everyone. Helps us realize our mortality, and the realization that bravery comes through vulnerability.\n\n', '\n\n  This is an exploration by an intelligent, highly accomplished neurosurgeon who searched for the real purpose of life by studying and fixing the brain. The miracle of the brain’s workings could hold answers to help humanity understand it’s purpose. The reader travels with him on the intellectual paths he takes with humor, compassion and love. We also travel with him on his journey with an incurable disease, at a tragically young age,  that forces him to face his mortality with the wisdom.I loved this book. It is not religious as so many of this type of books are. It is a deep exploration into topics that help us lead a richer life and a more peaceful and accepting death.\n\n', ""\n\n  I cried so much reading this book. Personally I did an English Specialist with a Psychology Major. I've never quite felt right after graduating and constantly unsure of what to do. But Kalanithi presents such a beautiful memoir that there is real potential for cross-disciplinary understanding that the patient and physician are at the end of the day human- that there's real pain and emotion that only when you inhabit both roles that you start to see that even as we are dying and understanding every unique detail and facet of why we are dying: we can't come to grips with the fact that we absolutely love the world. I have lent this book out immediately after finishing it realizing that how fragile life is, how easy it is to forget that the love of wisdom, the love of psychology, the love of literature: it's all just the love of living. I think even as he described time and space senses erosion as he got sicker that he never stopped loving what he does, the people around him- the fact this memoir is littered with literary and psychological references and even humour just makes it more meaningful- what we know is how little we know and how much still needs to be researched. I hope his wife and his colleagues take the time to keep trying to answer what Paul Kalanithi couldn't in the time he worked and in the time he wrote.\n\n"", '\n\n  Moving, insightful and easy to read.Following Kalanithi on his short journey to the end we all experience, the book is. once illuminating and intensely private. He shares the science, the philosophy, the emotions of imminent death,  in a skilfully written autobiography of the last two years of his life. At a time when he begins the final year of learning his specialty, he is struck by lightning with a diagnosis of inoperable cancer.  Most intriguing is the final chapter written by his wife after he has died. She comes to realize that love doesn’t die even when a loved one has.\n\n', ""\n\n  I was recommended this by a friend who found himself in the same situation - a physician who had what could be a mass detected during a checkup. While he has a happy ending to his story, this is a heartbreaking story of a life that comes to an end too soon and what goes through your mind when you see it coming and can't do anything to stop it.It should be depressing, and you may well find bits here and there that leave you incredibly sad, but overall this is a story about enjoying what you have while you have it and making the most of your opportunities no matter what might come next.\n\n"", ""\n\n  I really loved this book. It is the type of book that needs to be read more than once as one gets tied up in it emotionally and thereby you miss a lot of the more precious meaning that it is trying to convey. It made me sad as here was a man with great intellect that was lost too soon. It was obvious that he was set to work out some of life's deeper philosophical questions. His wide breadth of education and study would have enabled him to give some of us the understanding with some of the deeper of life's questions that we ask but are not able to find an answer to. I believe he would have been able to do that for us and for that reason I mourn his loss. The book is very well written and should be read by all.\n\n"", '\n\n  This book was chosen for our book club. I thoroughly enjoyed it and was extremely touched by the authors honesty and openness about his journey to self discovery in terms of practicing medicine and in realizing the kind of practitioner he wanted to be. The last part of the book, written by his wife, was touching and humbling as she described their journey together. This also gave the reader insight into who he was from the eyes of another. All in all the book was excellent and I felt privileged  to have read it.\n\n']"

When she excepted the truths I felt them. When she felt betrayed I felt it.My favourite part of Scarlett’s writing is that I feel it.

I loved certain aspects of the book such as:-FMC can wield knives, swords + daggers + can fight.-MMC is a broody vampire king who is also gallant with an interesting past.-the concept of vassal + vampire relationships + consent.-steamThe only complaints I had about the book was that the enemies to lovers dragged on + it was to the point of annoying at times. The concept of reincarnation was a huge plot in the story + honestly could have been further developed as it added so many interesting elements yet when it got that point, it became anti-climatic. And I guess for me, this is just a personal thing but I'm tired of reading about strong FMC's that are reactive. I found her to be reactive rather than strategic most of the time, and only a few times did she actually start to show what she was capable of.Overall still a good story if you love an enemies to lovers vampire romance\n\n""]"

It all takes place within one night.I did like the chemistry between the main characters, Jack and Quin. Their scenes together had a lot of spice. I think I was expecting a bit more darkness after reading the blurb, it seemed fairy tame, at least compared to others I have read. Obviously, this might be darker spice for some readers.I think if this was a full length book where we were able to see some of their relationship develop and learn more about their pasts it would have made this book “darker”. I did enjoy the introduction of his friends and at the end of the book there was a spoiler that they will have their own stories. Hoping we will get full novels featuring them because the author did a great job introducing them and enticing us.\n\n', '\n\n  This is a new to me author and after reading this one I’ll be looking for more.  It’s a short novella style book so knowing that it isn’t as detailed as I usually like my stories. That being said it has it all, quick banter, scintillating sex scenes, alittle drama and that golden HEA in the end. I almost wish this was more a prologue because I want more of Jack aka Joker (the recluse gamer with a deviant style in the bedroom) and Quinlan (young fresh faced writer). This is a standalone series and each one is centred around Jack’s friends we meet in this first instalment.\n\n', '\n\n  Holy smoking hotness, this book is insane!!  For being a quick read it was filled to the brim!  Joker and Quinlin are a match made in sexy heaven.  So hot….is it ok to be jealous of a fake person?  I am so jealous of Q…damn.Thank you Dana for writing a hot, continuous burn that doesn’t drag.  I loved it so much!\n\n', ""\n\n  This book was so good, I am obsessed with it. Dana DID her thing AGAIN. The story follows Jack, an anonymous gamer who gets interviewed by Quinlan and makes her an offer she can't refuse. I literally did not put the book down once I got it in my hands. It was short, good and the right amount of spiceI need. This book is everything you need and more.\n\n"", '\n\n  For a quick read novella this was well written and enjoyable to read. I liked how much I got to know the characters in such a short time.It’s not a higher rating for me because some of the kink is just not for me. As other reviews have mentioned it’s not as dark as the synopsis implies but if you like having your MC to use degrading terms as during sex and having them crawl for them you will like this a lot more then me. I’m all for some physical dominance but maybe I’m getting too old because I don’t have any interest in my partner having me act out submissive rolls like that. Too each their own, I’m sure a lot will love it. But that part is just not for me.\n\n', '\n\n  This is such a sexy, great read! It was quick and dirty, but also had such a loving relationship between Jack and Quinlan. Although this is a short story, the characters and the relationship between Jack and Q is well developed. I loved it and can’t wait to read on in the series!\n\n', '\n\n  Everything I love perfectly packed into this novella. As a plus sized girl living her best life with her gamer bad boy this was a home run. Ugh I want moreee\n\n', '\n\n  Honestly…A+It’s hot, it’s spicy, it’s rated R, and it wastes no time!Loved it!

  An indolent college student creates a chaotic fictional world in this classic of Irish literature: “A marvel of imagination, language, and humor” (New Republic).   In this comic masterpiece, our unnamed narrator—a student at University College, Dublin, who spends more time drinking and working on his novel than attending classes—creates a character, a pub owner named Trellis, who himself is devoted mainly to writing and sleeping. Soon Trellis is collaborating with an author of cowboy romances, and from there unspools a brilliantly unpredictable adventure that James Joyce himself called “a really funny book.”   “’Tis the odd joke of modern Irish literature—of the three novelists in its holy trinity, James Joyce, Samuel Beckett and Flann O’Brien, the easiest and most accessible of the lot is O’Brien. . . . Flann O’Brien was too much his own man, Ireland’s man, to speak in any but his own tongue.” —The Washington Post   “As with Scott Fitzgerald, there is a brilliant ease in [O’Brien’s] prose, a poignant grace glimmering off every page.” —John Updike   “One of the best books of our century.” —Graham Greene     Read more  ","['5.0 out of 5 stars', '2.0 out of 5 stars', '5.0 out of 5 stars', '5.0 out of 5 stars', '5.0 out of 5 stars', '5.0 out of 5 stars']","['\nAn absorbing, high quality book\n', '\nNonsense\n', ""\nFlann O'Brien\n"", '\nA Masterpiece!

I just didn’t get it.\n\n', '\n\n  ""At Swim-Two-Birds"", Brian O\'Nuallain\'s first novel, is a hilarious and surrealistic masterpiece.  he incorporated a blend of farce, satire and fantasy in plots within plots, with a distinctive dancing intellect and Celtic wit.  though it\'s been a century since he crafted this astonishing story, it still vibrantly shines.\n\n', '\n\n  This is, above all, a funny and playful book, playful with itself and the various conceits of fiction: the suspension of disbelief, the conventions of  form, and the pretensions of rhetoric.  Think of it as Pirandello meets  the Marx Brothers.""At Swim-Two-Birds"" delights in rapid-fire  wordplay and sophomoric experimentation (there are three alternative  beginnings to the story).  O\'Brien succeeds in this bombastic flair partly  because he doesn\'t take the literary enterprise--his own included--too  seriously.  He  races along at a Groucho-like pace, only to slow down in  wonderfully overwritten and overwrought scenes:""Together the two  strong men, joyous in the miracle of their health, put their bulging thews  and the fine ripple of their sinews together at the arm-pits of the  stricken king as they bent over him with their grunting red faces, their  four heels sinking down in the turf of the jungle with the stress of their  fine effort as they hoisted the madman to the tremulous support of his  withered legs.""Indeed!James Joyce praised O\'Brien as  ""a real author, with the true comic spirit,"" and Graham Greene  called this ""a book in a thousand....in the line of Tristram Shandy  and Ulysses.""  Like Joyce, O\'Brien dazzles us with language and the  sheer sound of words. The narrative is interrupted with rhetorical notes  (""Name of figure of speech: Litotes [or Meiosis]""), populated by  varying narrators ""Tour de force by Brinsley, vocally interjected,  being a comparable description in the Finn canon:,"" and buoyed by  dialogue that variously recalls 30\'s screwball comedies,B-movie Westerns,  and bad courtroom dramas.O\'Brien himself offers some literary  ""theory"" that illustrates his comic sensibility and offers sly  clues for his delighted (and maybe perplexed) reader:  ""...a  satisfactory novel should be a self-evident sham to which the reader could  regulate at will the degree of his credulity,"" and, ""Most authors  spend their time saying what has been said before--usually said much better  (Page 33)."" Flann O\'Brien\'s command of--and upending of--narrative  forms, and the hilarity of his farce make this an essential addition to any  comic library.  Then again, I could be wrong.(Buy it!)\n\n', '\n\n  ""You have left your reader behind,"" James Joyce told Flann, while, as Flann himself put it, he brandished ""Finnegan\'s Wake in his left hand.""  This is the most brilliant book I have read in years, something I read from beginning to end, going back, going over again, laughing out loud in the bathtub.  This book has done things contemporary writers are still afraid to approach, and it will go on that way, because Flann O\'Brien was daring and inventive and made Irish literature his home and Irish literature must thank him for that.\n\n', '\n\n  Excellent copy of the book, mailed in solid packaging, arrived safely and within a week of ordering.

Thank you to Joffe Books, NetGalley and the author for the e-ARC in exchange for an honest review.\n\n', ""\n\n  Rick Mofina is a new to me author. His latest book is Search for Her.Mofina starts off with a frightening premise. Fourteen year old Riley decides to wait in the RV while the rest of her newly blended family heads into the truck stop. When they get back on the road, they assume she is taking a nap in the bedroom. It's not until they're miles down the road that anyone genuinely checks. And yup, you guessed it - she's missing....The search for Riley is anything but easy. The police don't seem to believe Grace and husband John that it was an accident. Instead they're focusing on the family as suspects. The police work in Search for Her is busy, with many agencies involved as the case crosses state lines. Although all the right words are there, I had a hard time believing some of the investigation. Information or leads are discovered at fortuitous points in the story. Technology breaks down and isn't discovered for days. Mofina gives us lots of suspects right from the get go including the family. It seems every one of them is hiding something. The listener is given hints as to each family member's hidden secrets, but it takes a while before they are revealed. This does serve to keep the listener engaged. There are also lots of peripheral characters that may or may not have a bearing on the case. One caught my eye as the way they were portrayed was just too 'good' IMO.Understandably, the family is panicked. Especially Grace. And I felt for her - I really did. But I got so tired of her caterwauling 'Where's Riley?' I know, I know, her child is missing. Character development takes a back seat in Search for Her. Instead, it action that propels the book forward. There are twists along the way, but some of them seemed awkward to me, including the reasoning and mind set of the initial suspect.I chose to listen to Search for Her. The reader was Jennifer Jill Araya. This was a first listen of this narrator for me. She has a nice clear speaking voice, enunciates well, paces her speaking speed, and is, for the most part, really easy to listen to. She provides tones and voices for many, including males that are believable. She is indeed a very expressive reader and captures the tone of Mofina's book with her interpretation.Mofina hits all the right notes for what I would call 'light suspense.' But, I prefer my suspense a little darker and my police procedures a little more believable. Overall, an easy read for the beach bag this summer.\n\n"", ""\n\n  Rick Mofina is one of my go to authors when I want a captivating read and Search For Her is his latest mystery/thriller.A family's cross country move turns into a journey from hell when the 14 yr old daughter goes missing at a busy truck stop. What follows is a relentless police investigation into a troubled family (resulting in many suspects) and a race against time to find her.Various storylines are weaved together making it confusing at times. However, it's full of action-packed twists and turns making you wonder what's next.

I started with Look the Part because I have heard nothing but good things, and she definitely did not disappoint! I absolutely ADORED this novel. If you love the single parent, lust-hate and beautiful connection relationship then this one is for you!.This story is about two individuals who have both been through so much and with love, compassion, sacrifice, and acceptance they learn to move on. When our heroine Ellen has an interview to move into the office space above Flints office she immediately is taken aback with how attracted she is to him.. Flint agrees to move Ellen into his complex not knowing that she was a music therapist.. and therefore creating immense amount of noise all day.

There are those special books that come into a reader’s life, the ones that tug at your heartstrings, pull you in, completely captivate you, and give you everything that you could have possibly hoped for in a book.  Look the Part was that book for me.  When I began reading it, I didn’t want to put it down.  When I wasn’t reading it, I was constantly thinking about the story and the characters and counting down the minutes until I would be able to return to this beautiful, all-consuming story.From beginning to end, this book owned my heart.  Look the Part is my definition of a well-rounded contemporary romance.  It just has it all.  It is filled with humor, great dialogue and banter, chemistry, tons of emotion, and that push and pull between the characters that offers up all of the tension that I enjoy.I felt an instant connection to the characters, not because my life mirrored theirs or because I shared their experiences, but because of the care that the author took in creating them.  They were real, emotional, flawed, and I was rooting for them from the very first page.  The whole cast of characters was done to perfection, each one adding their own special flair to the story.Whenever I read a book, I want to be invested in the characters and the story, but even more than that, I want to be able to feel everything that the characters are experiencing.  Well, I certainly felt this story.  From the laughter to the squeezing in my heart to the pangs in my stomach, I felt every bit of the joy, heartache, pain, need, and all of the love right along with them.  I wasn’t merely reading the words on the pages, I was living the story.I could go on and on about everything that I loved about Look the Part, but that would take too long.  I honestly can’t sing this book’s praises enough.  It is overflowing with heart, wit, and clever, flawless writing.  There aren’t too many books that I say this about, but I wish that I could read it again for the first time.\n\n', '\n\n  This is the first book I’ve read from this author and it was beautiful.  First she’s a good writer but she also offers the readers some jewels of wisdom.  The way she allows feelings to be felt and have their place is something us as women struggle with.  We often rush through our feelings and don’t lead with our hearts.  The plot also was not formulary or overly predictive which was nice.  As a mom of an autistic son, I appreciated her presentation of a family with an autistic child…as well as how she prefaced it at the start of the book.\n\n', '\n\n  This book is one of the best I’ve read in a long while. If I could, I would give it 10 🌟 no hesitation.  Jewel was a new author to me and I bought this book due to the 5 star rating and held on to it for a few months - don’t do that - read it immediately because this read is an experience.  This author just quickly climbed to my top 5 and I read atleast 250 books a year. This story follows Flint, Elle and Harry.  It is filled with so many funny experiences and light moments that I couldn’t put it down but, it also caused the “ugly” tears.  Those moments were quick, thank goodness, but I walked away feeling like I had been uplifted, and had learned a great deal.  It is emotional, but also fun and light; angsty and mysterious and suspenseful and simply wonderful.\n\n', ""\n\n  This book will take you through an emotional rollercoaster ride of emotions. One minute you will be laughing at the quick wit and humorous dialogue then the next you will be grabbing the tissue box as you bleed for the characters. One of Jewel E. Ann's many talents is creating unique characters you can't help but fall in love with, they're not perfect but they are perfectly flawed.If you love a book with all the feels then this is the book for you.\n\n"", '\n\n  I just can’t get enough of Jewel E Ann books. No matter the subject I know I will totally connect with the characters and feel all the feels during their journey.  Another amazingly told story.\n\n']"

You, Holly and Alexander are now in my top 10 books read in 2021!Don’t we all want to meet a handsome Duke, a gentleman, a philanthropist, a pillar in the community and a man who makes one crazy hot when he kisses, when his fingers touch your skin, when he whispers in your ear and when he is dirty in bed! Ladies, I’d like you to meet the 13th Duke of Dalforth, Henry Charles Alexander Theodore Dalforth. He is all of the above and so much more.Holly (Holland Harper), an American, a teacher by trade currently a tutor/social secretary for the tween daughters of an American couple while living and working in London. She has one more night of holidays left before going back to work little does she know she’s about to meet her Duke!Their eyes meet over a lowered newspaper, followed by a hand (part of a beautiful strong wrist); leading to a cup of coffee and a night of drinking, smoldering eyes meeting each other, all because of a mix up with a pair of swingers, pretend names and a night they can’t forget.This dear readers/reviewers of books, this is where I give you just a few more hints, the Duke has a half-brother, a sister and a six year old and eight year old nephew. Not to take away from the Duke and his teacher but these boys, honestly I swooned over them as well.Through the magic of an author they all end up in Scotland at Kilblair Castle, where their story continues to “heat up.”I love reading Donna Alam books! In No Ordinary Gentleman she gives readers witty retorts, the slyest of glances in crowded rooms, a Duke you can’t help but fall in love with and a teacher who you would want to teach your own children. She makes you laugh out loud and grumble under your breath while giving her characters advice and a twist you never saw coming.Author Donna Alam is a one-click author for me.

The writing is like any other mature couple which I appreciated.It has a 2nd chance feel to it. They had one kiss years ago and then they never spoke of it for years even though they both still had it bad for each other. I love this trope and this did not disappoint.It also has that slight taboo/off limits feel. At the time of the first kiss they were step brothers living together. Now their parents are divorced but still stay in touch so there's that secretcy and wondering what will they think. It added a little suspense/slight drama/slight angst to the story. Though it's still a very low angst read.It is a holiday book in the sense that they are on Xmas break from school and there's a Christmas tree but it's a low key Christmas book. So even though this is releasing in Jan and some like myself may be over Xmas, you would still ver much enjoy this. It's just that melt your heart sweetness that is perfect regardless of the time. For the most part the story focuses on the 2 MCs thinking they are going to a family gathering only to end up being stuck in a cabin just the 2 of them for a week due to a blizzard and all that comes along with being stuck alone with the one you secretly still love.Both characters were so sweet. I loved them both and they had great chemistry together. This is a story I couldn't stop listening to. I loved the plot. It drew me in from start to finish. It's light, heartwarmingly sweet with some low heat. Great writing. I loved it and would definitely recommend the story.As for the narration, for me it was just ok. 3.5 stars. His voice was pleasant enough and kept good pace.  His tone/age suited the fact that the characters are college students. What I didn't like was that the voices weren't noticeablly different. Also, he definitely wasn't monotone but he didn't express the emotions as well as other narrators I've heard before.Note: There is also a freebie called Going the Distance and it's great too. A little extra about these 2 guys on Prolific Works.\n\n"", ""\n\n  This series just went from strength to strength! I loved the first book in this series. But the second book just took it to a whole new level.Quinn has certainly had a hard time of it. Losing a parent, having to deal with a new family when you're not even done processing the grief, struggling with school and an emotionally abusive boyfriend. But deep down, this character seemed to be one of the strongest. He just needed someone to help him see that... queue Jonas.Jonas uses his sexuality and frequent hookups as a shield for his true feelings.Now, bring them both together in a beautiful cabin on a snowed in mountain, and you get a steamy romance. But this book was so much more than this. The author took the time to show how Quinn and Jonas both dealt with their feelings and emotions - in order for this to truly work for them.I loved reading their story, and struggled to put it down! (Yes, D.J. Jamison - I'm blaming you for me still being up at 3am this morning because I had to finish the book) If you haven't read book 1 - start there. There is a brief reprise of two characters from book 1 in this book. Read it, you won't regret it.\n\n"", ""\n\n  This was an enjoyable tale by DJ Jamison.The characters were sweet as they tried to navigate a blizzard and being forced together.Quinn just trying to get his act together after a failed relationship and believing he was a failure in general. Jonas just needed time to find himself and get over his crush on his former stepbrother.DJ's characters often find their way back through communication and having their person just be supportive and this is no exception. Both Jonas and Quinn were very real as the weeks went by.I thoroughly enjoyed the writing and I am ready to dive into another book.I received a copy of this book for an honest review.\n\n"", ""\n\n  This was a really great well developed story of a second chance romance for.something that would have been forbidden but now is just a bit awkward to work out. Jonas and Quinn were once step-brothers, and though their families have stayed in touch their parents divorced years back. It was a hard time for Quinn after the kids of his Dad, trying to make it work with a new family which felt like a betrayal to what his life had been. It was also hard for Jonas as he tried not to push himself in this person who was supposed to be his brother but he had a crush on, all while trying to get him back into living his life. Meeting again years later as adults while snowed in could have followed an expected path but was actually a lot about decisions made, the way life works out, self discovery, and love both familial and intimate. It really explored how hard it was for the kids of the families as they came together, trying to make something work when they each had reservations and expectations that drove them apart. It also looked into how having a crush on someone can be so different when you really get to know them, how it can change your view of a person and change the way things turn out.It also explored through decisions and consequences, and at what point it is your responsibility alone or if you can accept help of those who love and support you. It wasn't an easy or direct path which made it a much more comprehensive and believable story, as it was hard work to get these two guys where they wanted both in love and in life. An excellent read!\n\n"", '\n\n  Forced proximity isn’t normally one of my favoured tropes but, damn, do Jonas and Quinn make me rethink that!  Jamison takes these ex-step-brothers, shakes them with a ton of snow, throws them in a luxurious cabin and lets them take over.  And It is a beautiful thing to read.The scenery is fantastic, the chemistry between the MCs exquisite and the layered complexities of both characters sublime.This is the perfect holiday romance for escaping the realities of the real world and enjoying the descriptors of Jonas’ abs while falling deeply into a fabulous love story.\n\n']"

There was so much potential for some edginess, some real suspense, some fire but nope. The author introduced many  imaginative ideas but then others felt as if it was two people writing.

Although often inferred, there was even a ""5"" minutes interlude giving a small insight into the sexual tension between the two, but it just fizzled out.  I am not sure why this book is in this category maybe suspense or corporate takeover/espionage, but definitely not erotica.  When their attraction was written in near the very end of the book, it felt forced, almost like an afterthought by the author.  They went from avoidance to nearly BDSM in a couple of words, and the BDSM aspect was in more out of place because there had been no hints through the book\'s entirety.  I must say, I\'m disappointed.\n\n']"

It is a spin-off series of the Born in Blood Mafia Chronicles and the Camorra Chronicles. This duet is about the mafia princess Marcella Vitiello and the MC Maddox White.While I agree with many readers that this story did not need to be published as two different books, I do believe that Marcella and Maddox’s story was an excellent way to kick off the new series. The new generation may be bound by some rules but not to the extend their parents were, and after reading Maddox and Marcella’s story it is evident that the second generation will not have any issues breaking the rules.Marcella’s kidnapping in By Sin I Rise Part I has left scars behind – emotional and physical ones. However, Marcella does not let the kidnapping dominate her life but rather rises like a phoenix from the ashes. She is standing up for herself, her choices, her needs and wants, her desires, and most importantly she does not let anyone define her worth. She has suffered but she is anything far from broken. I really enjoyed her character a lot. While others wanted Marcella to have made more sacrifices to be in this relationship with Maddox, I loved that Maddox was the one to sacrifice everything to be with the woman he loved. This was very different in comparison to the previous books. Maddox and Marcella are passionate and have a fire, and nothing will keep these two apart.The highlight of the book for me was Maddox’s interactions with the Vitiello family and reading about old favorite characters. I really enjoyed reading about how Maddox slowly became part of the family.This book is a must-read if you have read By Sin I Rise Part I and if you are a Cora Reilly fan. Such as with her other books, Cora Reilly will pull you into this mafia universe that she has created, and you will not want the book to end.As usual, I cannot wait for next release!***This ARC was kindly provided to me by the author in exchange for an honest review.***\n\n', ""\n\n  I love ittttttttt.

Part two of By Sin I Rise picks up right where BSIR part one leaves off. I’m still not entirely sure how I feel about part two. I absolutely loved part one and all the chemistry, angst, and action but for some reason this novel has left me feeling a tad disappointed. I’ve been a fan of Cora for years now but for some reason BSIR part two didn’t wow me as I would have hoped, but with that being said it was still a wonderful conclusion to part one!Marcella is definitely Cora’s strongest heroine to date – she knows what she wants and always fights for it. I admired her strength and willingness to follow her heart always. Marcella’s character grew even more from the first book and watching her transition from her sheltered life into this strong bad ass women was so inspiring.Maddox’s character was conflicting for me, maybe it’s because I prefer a more broody and extreme hero whereas Maddox was sweet and caring and gave up everything for Marcella – which is completely admirable but at times I felt bad for him, why should he give up his entire life and all he’s ever known, and Marcella gives up nothing? Something about that just didn’t sit right with me, and to be honest he didn’t really feel like one of Cora’s signature bad boy heroes.I will say I’m beyond excited for Amo’s book and I hope he lives up to my expectations (being Luca’s son he has to, right?!) I’m very happy with the ending of this novel and how we got to see what happens after all the struggles to get to their happily ever after and I do look forward to seeing appearances of Marcella and Maddox in the next books!3.5⭐️𝘈𝘙𝘊 𝘳𝘦𝘤𝘦𝘪𝘷𝘦𝘥 𝘪𝘯 𝘦𝘹𝘤𝘩𝘢𝘯𝘨𝘦 𝘧𝘰𝘳 𝘢𝘯 𝘩𝘰𝘯𝘦𝘴𝘵 𝘳𝘦𝘷𝘪𝘦𝘸.\n\n', '\n\n  Wow, I didn’t know how this could work out and am completely happy on how it did!

He doesn’t conform, he doesn’t submit, he won’t toe the line, but he will do whatever he has to in order to be in Marcella’s world to be with her. Marcella is no slouch either, she grows up from the princess she was to the queen she is, all Vitiello and the perfect blend of her mother and father. The differences can’t keep these two apart, the bond between them too strong no matter the test. Both of these characters come into their own, are strong alone and invincible together.

Marcella was more of the dominate in this book and it was a bit off-putting at times. That being said, the storyline was was perfect and paced well. I still binge read this baby and will definitely re-read it again in the future.Even though I knocked a star off, I still highly recommend Cora\'s work.\n\n']"

  #1 NEW YORK TIMES BESTSELLER • In her latest book, Brené Brown writes, “If we want to find the way back to ourselves and one another, we need language and the grounded confidence to both tell our stories and be stewards of the stories that we hear. This is the framework for meaningful connection.”In Atlas of the Heart, Brown takes us on a journey through eighty-seven of the emotions and experiences that define what it means to be human. As she maps the necessary skills and an actionable framework for meaningful connection, she gives us the language and tools to access a universe of new choices and second chances—a universe where we can share and steward the stories of our bravest and most heartbreaking moments with one another in a way that builds connection. Over the past two decades, Brown’s extensive research into the experiences that make us who we are has shaped the cultural conversation and helped define what it means to be courageous with our lives. Atlas of the Heart draws on this research, as well as on Brown’s singular skills as a storyteller, to show us how accurately naming an experience doesn’t give the experience more power—it gives us the power of understanding, meaning, and choice. Brown shares, “I want this book to be an atlas for all of us, because I believe that, with an adventurous heart and the right maps, we can travel anywhere and never fear losing ourselves.”   Read more  ","['5.0 out of 5 stars', '5.0 out of 5 stars', '5.0 out of 5 stars', '3.0 out of 5 stars', '5.0 out of 5 stars', '5.0 out of 5 stars', '4.0 out of 5 stars']","['\nA roadmap to a better self, not a book of answers, only you have answers with the provided map.\n', ""\nGoogle her, she'll change your life\n"", '\nBeautifully presented and written\n', '\nI like the book but it arrived damaged.\n', '\nA fabulous book.\n', '\nN/A\n', '\nA great resource for mapping emotions!\n']","['\n\n  Lets be open about how I see Brene Brown.  I have read all her books, many twice.  For those who know her other material you know you are going to cry at some point.  Those tears have always been about connections gained, lost or missed.I have purchased this book in its physical form which is well worth it because of the nature of its layout.  I have now purchased it on kindle for the purpose of further study and portability.  However also for the the additional purpose of leaving a review.  I want to leave a review because I see other reviews that are completely missing the point.  This book is a map not a book of answers.  Maps represent possibility it is up to you if you want to go on the adventure.  Your individuality and uniqueness make it impossible to find direct answers as to what you require to become whole.  You have to use the map and be willing to go on the journey.Now about the crying…Brene is getting closer to truths.  The other books two or three good bawls each.  This one I am now only one sixth completed and already have surpassed all the others.I am in the journey, following the map.  It is scary, painful, but in a certain way provides the elation of freedom after going through the pain.Thanks to Brene and her team for this.I have now finished the book over a two day read marathon.

Years ago, when I first started trying to tune into my emotions I did research to compile a list of all known and named emotions and their definitions.  I used it to be more attuned to my feelings, and have used it to help my children and others do the same.  I wish this book would have been in print at that time.  Unlike the hyped expectations of some others which seemed to fall flat, I read just looking to see what was offered, and found it informative, touching, and beautiful.  This book will not save or fix your relationships, but it could help you follow the instructions of the emperor Trajan, “Know Thyself”.  I deducted a single star for Brenè’s justification of Joy in the “justice” of others’ wrong doing.  I realize she can’t help but have the western view of justice, but the ancient views of justice coupled with indigenous and other cultures’ beliefs show a much more ‘’connected” view of justice, where it’s objective is to reconcile the wrong doer and help them heal, rather than punish them.  I guess I was just surprised to see that slip up, given her focus and love of connection.  I’m glad she’s not writing a review of my life’s work, though.  I’m sure there would be many more incongruencies and flaws than I have found in hers.  All in all, a beautiful resource for assistance in emotional mapping.  I highly recommend it.\n\n']"

  NEW YORK TIMES BESTSELLER • From the bestselling author of Dark Matter and the Wayward Pines trilogy comes a relentless thriller about time, identity, and memory—his most mind-boggling, irresistible work to date, and the inspiration for Shondaland’s upcoming Netflix film.“Gloriously twisting . . . a heady campfire tale of a novel.”—The New York Times Book ReviewNAMED ONE OF THE BEST BOOKS OF THE YEAR BY Time • NPR • BookRiotReality is broken. At first, it looks like a disease. An epidemic that spreads through no known means, driving its victims mad with memories of a life they never lived. But the force that’s sweeping the world is no pathogen. It’s just the first shock wave, unleashed by a stunning discovery—and what’s in jeopardy is not our minds but the very fabric of time itself. In New York City, Detective Barry Sutton is closing in on the truth—and in a remote laboratory, neuroscientist Helena Smith is unaware that she alone holds the key to this mystery . . . and the tools for fighting back. Together, Barry and Helena will have to confront their enemy—before they, and the world, are trapped in a loop of ever-growing chaos.Praise for Recursion“An action-packed, brilliantly unique ride that had me up late and shirking responsibilities until I had devoured the last page . . . a fantastic read.”—Andy Weir, #1 New York Times bestselling author of The Martian“Another profound science-fiction thriller. Crouch masterfully blends science and intrigue into the experience of what it means to be deeply human.”—Newsweek“Definitely not one to forget when you’re packing for vacation . . . [Crouch] breathes fresh life into matters with a mix of heart, intelligence, and philosophical musings.”—Entertainment Weekly“A trippy journey down memory lane . . .

This is considered a DARK romance. Please keep that in mind when reading this book. I’m a huge fan of dark romance and even I found some of these kinks to be a bit extreme. While it may not be for everyone, the author is very respectful of both parties. Don’t rate a book poorly simply because the book is too dark. Know going in... this book will test your limits.Blakely is a junior at Barrington college. This is an elite private college for the children of the world’s wealthiest and most powerful families. Ryat is a senior at the college. Now that he’s passed all of his initiation tests, Ryat is inducted in as a Lord and is expected to select a woman to be his chosen one. The men are asked to abstain from sex until their senior year of college when they become Lords. As a gift for their sacrifice, they are gifted with a chosen one who will be their submissive.Ryat is asked to choose Blakely as his chosen one by the Lords. He starts off by stalking her and inserting himself into her life. When the time comes, Blakely willingly chooses to be with Ryat. Little did she know, that electing to be his chosen one would result in more than she bargained for. The twists and turns of this story will leave you on the edge of your seat.This story has some of the most taboo sex that I have ever read. The author explored forced sex fantasies, breath play, praise kinks among other things. Towards the end of the book… I couldn’t help become affected every time Ryat said “good girl”. Like I mentioned before, certain elements of this story are not my forte; however, the scenes were exceptionally well written. The female character’s best interests were always put first. The author goes on to say that a lot of these fantasies were Blakely’s and that women are often made to feel ashamed of their sexual desires and there is nothing wrong with consensual sex between two adults. I couldn’t put this book down.If you are a fan of dark taboo romance, then I feel like you’re going to enjoy this story. This is enough mystery and intrigue to keep you hooked until the very last line.I was provided an advanced reader copy in exchange for an honest review.\n\n', ""\n\n  It's been 24 hours and my head is still spinning. I read quite a bit of dark romance but this is my first secret society book and I loved it! It's so different from reading mafia or crime dark reads. Shantel put her magic to work and created a world that's so addictive to read that I was literally up until 4am reading. Here's a tip-don't start reading this one past 10pm because you will get sucked into the story, you will get sucked into the amazing characters and you will not be able to resist some of the hottest sex scenes I've ever read!The chemistry between Ryat and Blakely is there from the beginning but what starts as an obligation for him and a revenge tactic for her turns into something real, something that they can rely on and fight for outside of the all the secret society business. Their devotion to each other and the intensity of their feelings-it's just everything!Shantel has outdone herself and between all the heated moments is a story of intrigue, power and the ritualistic foundation that keeps it all going from generation to generation. I enjoyed all the layers of intricate details-the how's, the why's and eventually the WTF moments when things start falling into place.Triggers are aplenty and no, this is not a book for every romance reader but I still say going in blind is best for this one.Shantel has once again left me absolutely hot, bothered and extremely in awe of her talent to take dark romance to another mind-blowing level.\n\n""]"

Here are my personal pros and cons regarding this book:PROS:-The Pareto rule discussed in this book can literally change your perception of so many things. It is for this reason alone, that I got my money’s worth of the book.-It changes your perception of money.-It helps you to READ better. This book took me a year approximately to read. But I didn’t read it for the purpose of simply reading it. I would read a couple of pages and spend a couple of days to a week pondering about the information and APPLYING it (this is so important)!-Time management help for those of us who can’t make up our minds, and waste so much of our lives.-The mindset that Ferris had towards product testing prior to releasing your product(s) is genius. I was originally wanting to purchase products and materials for my business right away but this book helped me to understand HOW I can test the waters with a smaller amount of money before expanding.-This book is perfect for EVERY college/university student. A great read on how to manage your time better while also learning to succeed in your business and/or career. For example, I started to spend just the minimal amount of time to get the best results possible. At the end of the day, a 4.0 for a student consists of a grade value between 85-100 and a student that gets ~85% is probably having a better life than the student who spends extra time on every assessment. And for what? Your 4.0 is assessed with the same view either way.-Essential for individuals who are starting a small business! Gives great outlines to how you can manage your finances better.CONS:-Certain parts of the book are really dry. Feel free to skip certain chapters. Not everything is useful for everyone.-The author has a LOT of unnecessary information. Most people will not be using most of the book's information in their daily lives.-Information on outsourcing is NOT a good idea for individuals of every profession. Out sourcing is not ideal for everyone, so please assess your situation carefully before going about this way. If you are in academia, and word gets around that you are outsourcing your job... you will MOST definitely be fired.-Over a third of the book is about outsourcing! Not necessary and it takes the reader so many chapters to get to a section that doesn't talk about outsourcing.\n\n"", ""\n\n  Total garbage...

  In the vein of Naomi Novik’s New York Times bestseller Spinning Silver and Katherine Arden’s national bestseller The Bear and the Nightingale, this unforgettable debut— inspired by Hungarian history and Jewish mythology—follows a young pagan woman with hidden powers and a one-eyed captain of the Woodsmen as they form an unlikely alliance to thwart a tyrant. In her forest-veiled pagan village, Évike is the only woman without power, making her an outcast clearly abandoned by the gods. The villagers blame her corrupted bloodline—her father was a Yehuli man, one of the much-loathed servants of the fanatical king. When soldiers arrive from the Holy Order of Woodsmen to claim a pagan girl for the king’s blood sacrifice, Évike is betrayed by her fellow villagers and surrendered.  But when monsters attack the Woodsmen and their captive en route, slaughtering everyone but Évike and the cold, one-eyed captain, they have no choice but to rely on each other. Except he’s no ordinary Woodsman—he’s the disgraced prince, Gáspár Bárány, whose father needs pagan magic to consolidate his power. Gáspár fears that his cruelly zealous brother plans to seize the throne and instigate a violent reign that would damn the pagans and the Yehuli alike. As the son of a reviled foreign queen, Gáspár understands what it’s like to be an outcast, and he and Évike make a tenuous pact to stop his brother.  As their mission takes them from the bitter northern tundra to the smog-choked capital, their mutual loathing slowly turns to affection, bound by a shared history of alienation and oppression. However, trust can easily turn to betrayal, and as Évike reconnects with her estranged father and discovers her own hidden magic, she and Gáspár need to decide whose side they’re on, and what they’re willing to give up for a nation that never cared for them at all.   Read more  ","['3.0 out of 5 stars', '5.0 out of 5 stars', '5.0 out of 5 stars', '4.0 out of 5 stars']","['\nWas almost great\n', '\nUnforgetable\n', '\nOne of the best books I have ever read!!\n', ""\nA great read that I didn't want to put down\n""]","[""\n\n  I found that this book could have been great, could have been one of my favorites. It has fallen short for me however. I didn't mind that much of the book was slow paced, or that relationships weren't as deeply fleshed out as some other books. The lore was interesting when we got it, the characters were good and I didn't even mind the enemies to lovers romance (despite it not being my go to and more a thing I avoid). So for about 75% of this book I was having a great time. I read the entire novel in a few hours. But the ending was where it fell apart for me.The ending was rushed. Boy did everything happen fast. Which could have been fine, except the pacing of the entire rest of the book didn't match. It was paced more like a book in a series than a standalone. From what I could find via google this book isn't a series. I could be wrong, but it still makes no sense why the ending just suddenly happened. We spend the majority of the book on character growth (overcoming ingrained cultural hate and personal struggles) while they hunt for what is basically a macguffin. Which was all perfectly fine. I'm always up for a good macguffin when it is done right. The thing that was weird with this one? We go through so much pain and the main character pays the price for obtaining it and...the enemy just happens to be there. They just happen to catch them, and then one of the very bad dudes takes the macguffin. And...it is promptly forgotten. Seriously, this thing was not useful in the least. As far as I could tell, it got left on the table. Within a chapter or two, they manage to defeat the one who was set up as the big bad who was practically unkillable. Okay, cool. Except they do nothing differently? He just happens to die this time? Or did they hit his Achille's ankle no one knew he had? This still could have been saved had the rest of the ending not followed. Nothing becomes concrete, the main relationship is left open ended. The options given to them are crap and it leaves you with the feeling of 'this is as good as it gets'. It felt like the book was pointless. There was very little actual change that happened besides a small group of people's feelings to another group and a change of kings.It left me asking why I had read it, and being frustrated with how things turned out. Maybe it just wasn't my book, and that is fair. It wasn't bad, but it wasn't special either. And I shouldn't have to put this part in, but I feel like I should. You don't get to abuse someone for their entire life, treat them as disposable garbage, and then be redeemed for showing up. Just no. Your one semi good deed does not erase years of torment. You have to earn your redemption and that is not up to you. I get too that the victim can 'love' the abusers. But giving you the bare necessities of life so they can one day use you is not worthy of your love. Loyalty to your people and what they stand for? Sure. But the main character loves them? if the rest of the ending hadn't already ruined my mood this alone would have.It is a dark read that is full of abuse, self harm and sacrifice with very little pay off to make it worth it. I would still encourage you to give it a try as books are extremely subjective and it might be perfect to someone else. But if you are unsure in any way I would try a library first.

Things like fear or anger ""coiling in my chest"", for example - great imagery the first time, good the second time, and kind of lost meaning every time after that. So is it the BEST written book? Probably not, but the pace, action sequences, occasional creepiness (there\'s one monster in there that was absolutely terrifying to read at 2 a.m.), even the political intrigue and religious allegories made the entire book well worth reading.\n\n']"

  #1 NEW YORK TIMES BESTSELLER • Jack Reacher is back in a brand-new page-turning thriller from acclaimed #1 bestselling authors Lee Child and Andrew Child.Digging graves had not been part of my plans when I woke up that morning. Reacher goes where he wants, when he wants. That morning he was heading west, walking under the merciless desert sun—until he comes upon a curious scene. A Jeep has crashed into the only tree for miles around. A woman is slumped over the wheel. Dead? No, nothing is what it seems. The woman is Michaela Fenton, an army veteran turned FBI agent trying to find her twin brother, who might be mixed up with some dangerous people. Most of them would rather die than betray their terrifying leader, who has burrowed his influence deep into the nearby border town, a backwater that has seen better days. The mysterious Dendoncker rules from the shadows, out of sight and under the radar, keeping his dealings in the dark. He would know the fate of Fenton’s brother. Reacher is good at finding people who don’t want to be found, so he offers to help, despite feeling that Fenton is keeping secrets of her own. But a life hangs in the balance. Maybe more than one. But to bring Dendoncker down will be the riskiest job of Reacher's life. Failure is not an option, because in this kind of game, the loser is always better off dead.

The secondary characters had no depth either. I kept skipping pages because the book didn't hold my attention. The plot made little sense, and the ending was weak. Two stars for the editing. I said the last Reacher novel would be my last. Wish I had listened to myself. I don't mind paying for a good book, but I felt this was way overpriced. Very disappointed.\n\n"", ""\n\n  This was put together by someone who seemed to have thought that sentence fragments added vigour to the writing, despite the fact that the fragmenting was so rampant through most of the book, that it detracted from the meaning.  Perhaps Child's son had read too much about Hemingway, and thought fragments were manly.  I don't know.  At several points, the main writer (presumably the son) lost track of matters such as the time of day, the amount of daylight, and so on. In addition, the book was written in the first person--not a great idea for a Jack Reacher book, since it limits perspective too greatly. I'll never buy another collaboration with the kid.  If Lee Child wants to keep his reputation, he'd better do the writing himself, and send his kid back to the sandbox, since he cannot write.\n\n"", ""\n\n  Complaints in no particular order: 1). When you wait a full year between books we deserve better than 322 pages. 2). Lazy authorship written at an 8th. grade level. 3). A ridiculous plot with an even more ridiculous subplot. I swore my last Reacher book would be the last and it should have been. I'm afraid Reacher, Jack (no middle name) and I have come to the end.\n\n"", '\n\n  I feel like this is blasphemy cuz I’m such a Lee Child fan but I buy the last several books (years) and I find it’s just some exercise in something familiar to do but I don’t find myself entertained.  This is the same. Yawn. I find myself skipping entire paragraphs of redundant or boring prose about what the parking lot looks like in minute detail like he’s killing off pages to be filled. Been this way for a few books. This first person view on this book removed mystique of the character - not enhanced it. Somewhere around book 7 I noticed a larger change like he’s got his mom writing them. I could go into detail of the elements of excitement that changed but why bother. Have you noticed Reacher became asexual 6 books ago. There’s no romantic aspect at all. Did Lee get impotence and now his character is also celibate? Kind of done with this series. This book is particularly bad. High school level writing. That’s a shame\n\n', '\n\n  I’ve read all of Lee Childs books and I  would rate this one close to the bottom of the list. It’s story line is weak and unbelievable in parts, such as. Example, your partner gets his head blown off by a woman and you want to have sex with her before you shoot her. Come on you can do better Lee. The description of all the tunnels becomes monotonous and only takes up space. Lots of tunnels but save us from the boredom of mentioning every turn, it accomplishes nothing. We get it, lots of tunnels. I could go on but I’ve made my point. I’m disappointed. You may be “better off” not to read this one.\n\n', ""\n\n  The setup is seriously confusing. The dialog is stilted, and should not be first person as that emphasizes the poor dialog. I gave up after one chapter and went back to reading Dune Messiah for the 5th time instead. I may try again later, but as with the Jack Widow series, I think it's over for me. I feel I should ask for my money back... It's that disappointing. EDIT: The return window on books is really short, so I am stuck with this awful novel. Sigh ...\n\n"", '\n\n  Will the REAL Reacher PLEASE stand up!!!!  I have read all the Reacher novels( i thought it very odd in the very first-Killing Floor,  when Joe is killed  then resurrected in many more stories?!)  This lacks the grit  with the shock and awe of before. A very predictable recipe writing formula, which leaves nothing to the imagination. Having read the reviews of his brothers books(BAD) methinks he is behind the quill! All the originality is gone , so as Reacher disappears over the horizon once more this reader bids him adieu not au revoir!!?\n\n', ""\n\n  Even with I am sure the best of intentions, his brother can't write Reacher. Storyline is nonsense, transitions move too quickly, no character development. The first person thing just does not work. Last one I will ever buy unless Lee Childs starts writing them again.\n\n""]"

I didn’t even know you could get refunds on books, but this is one I applied for. I got 39% and had enough. Normally I try to trudge through a book because I hate not finishing, but this felt like I was wasting my time.Where to begin?Well the characters might be bipolar. Or they have zero idea how to interact like civilized adults. The way they ripped into each other and tore the other one down was basically a toxic relationship. Now, I’m the first to admit I’m not some feminist that wants women to be treated a specific way and I’ve read plenty of books with a dominant male. But Jameson isn’t a hot alpha male with dominant tendencies. He’s an overgrown child who treats women like crap. The female protagonist isn’t any better and acts like a victim even though she’s equally as ignorant and annoying. Hopefully I’ll get a refund so I can put it towards something I actually might enjoy.\n\n', '\n\n  I enjoyed this story as I do all of TL Swan’s books.  It kept me entertained and turning the pages.  The story is fast -paced and the author dives right in.  I still have no real idea what Jay’s problem was when he so cruelly cut things off - I didn’t understand the author’s reasons nor did I think it made much sense so that was frustrating.  After reading Mr. Masters which I loved I thought this book was a little choppy and did’t flow.  Don’t get me wrong, I have given it 4 stars and I can’t wait for this author’s work, I just found the angst so over the top and the reasons behind it vague.  With Masters you completely understand  each person’s upset, anger and heartbreak but for this book, I didn’t get it, especially in relation to the deep heartbreak.  I do enjoy her books though, regardless but I must say that I absolutely HATE the bold text the author uses for the male POV!  It is awful, bothersome, difficult to read, and frustrating.  It spoils the read, especially if you have the text a little bigger.  It really was like reading someone shouting at you, pages and pages at a time.  I hated it! This is a common format choice for the author but it is not a pleasant way to read a book.  The author may not realize that the degree of boldness is not changeable by the reader.  Depending on the reading app, the size of text and font the boldness is just horrific! And I hate it!\n\n', '\n\n  You would think by the title this book would be all about the sex. In truth it is a very compelling love story with really good love scenes. Ok, they get pretty steamy lol, but the love the main characters feel is present. Looking forward to the next book in the series. Well done Ms. Swan, well done!\n\n', '\n\n  What a sweet 5 star surprise! I LOVE Jameson! All the “Miles” brothers have major hot potential. Our first in the series, has hot sex, angst, a great story that unfolds forever and keeps you page turning, exes that get in the way. Jameson and Emily meet as a one night stopover!! It could be corny that she ends up working for him but the story moves forward in directions you never guess and Emily ends up solving the crime. While Jameson is stunted abit as a “relationship” person the camping chapter had me laughing out loud! I love that you delivered a great first book story with a lot of foundation for the future brothers! While Emily gets a little droney at times you can see why it does mirror real life “with your girlfriends discussing all the gossip”... I cannot wait for brother number 2 and am so glad you let us have our happy ending...it was hard fought!!\n\n', '\n\n  TL Swan does it again with another hot read. A continuous roller coaster of emotions that left me rooting for Jameson and Emily to be together and then in the next moment, wanting to smack him up the side of the head! It was such a page turner that I read non-stop...\n\n', ""\n\n  3.5 StarsIn the last few months, T.L. Swan's books were highly recommended by fellow readers on social medias. I finally decided to see what all the hype was about and read my first book from this author. The Stopover was an okay read for me with some great moments and others that kind of diminished my overall appreciation of the story.At first, I really enjoyed the banter between Emily and Jameson. The push and pull was interesting and their chemistry intense. After a while though, I felt it was redundant between them and sometimes both heroes acted juvenile. Despite these little critics, I enjoyed the overall plot that kept me reading until the end.I'll definitely check out the next books in the Miles High Club Series, because I'm intrigued about the other Miles brothers.\n\n"", ""\n\n  I wish I could give this more stars.  It is a fantastic read.  T L Swan does not disappoint.  Jameson and Emily are very well developed characters.  I giggled  and laughed all the way thru the camping chapter.  Then the drama came and I was so invested in the story that I couldn't put it down.  I loved this story and will read it again this week.  It is worth the time it takes to read it, you won't be sorry.  It is too good a story to give away any of the plot lines.  Please give it a try, you will love this book as much as I did.\n\n"", '\n\n  Then this is a must read, I couldn’t put it down!

  Secrets of the Millionaire Mind reveals the missing link between wanting success and achieving it!Have you ever wondered why some people seem to get rich easily, while others are destined for a life of financial struggle? Is the difference found in their education, intelligence, skills, timing, work habits, contacts, luck, or their choice of jobs, businesses, or investments?The shocking answer is: None of the above!In his groundbreaking Secrets of the Millionaire Mind, T. Harv Eker states: ""Give me five minutes, and I can predict your financial future for the rest of your life!"" Eker does this by identifying your ""money and success blueprint."" We all have a personal money blueprint ingrained in our subconscious minds, and it is this blueprint, more than anything, that will determine our financial lives. You can know everything about marketing, sales, negotiations, stocks, real estate, and the world of finance, but if your money blueprint is not set for a high level of success, you will never have a lot of money—and if somehow you do, you will most likely lose it! The good news is that now you can actually reset your money blueprint to create natural and automatic success.Secrets of the Millionaire Mind is two books in one. Part I explains how your money blueprint works. Through Eker's rare combination of street smarts, humor, and heart, you will learn how your childhood influences have shaped your financial destiny. You will also learn how to identify your own money blueprint and ""revise"" it to not only create success but, more important, to keep and continually grow it.In Part II you will be introduced to seventeen ""Wealth Files,"" which describe exactly how rich people think and act differently than most poor and middle-class people. Each Wealth File includes action steps for you to practice in the real world in order to dramatically increase your income and accumulate wealth.If you are not doing as well financially as you would like, you will have to change your money blueprint. Unfortunately your current money blueprint will tend to stay with you for the rest of your life, unless you identify and revise it, and that's exactly what you will do with the help of this extraordinary book.

I\'m sure this book helps some people, but religion helps some people too.  The author prays on a few human flaws to sell his seminars advertised by this book. Those flaws are: confirmation bias, belief in meritocracy, needing to feel special, the need/desire to believe in something bigger than oneself, anxiety about randomness of life, and needing a sense of purpose and order in the chaotic nature of life.So, the author focuses on the concept that being poor or rich has to do with state of mind. Wealth attracts wealth, and poverty attracts more poverty, and so on. Author claims that rich people are more generous givers, which I have no idea where he gets this from. Social studies confirm that in general, lower income people are the ones more likely to be more compassionate, willing to help and give higher percentage of their income to charity than the wealthy. He creates a sort of aura around wealthy people and encourages the reader to worship them, that maybe one day, by worshipping them they will become like them. Worship the gods, because one day they might just make you one of them. Lol.Just like The Secret, this book is a mantra to a cult where the belief that if you change the way you think or how you see the world and how you interact with it, you will be happier. Which I guess is true, but then it depends on what you want in life.If all you want in life is to have a spouse and a child (most common goal of a majority of middle-class women), there is a great probability that this may actually happen; even if it may seem hard to find ""a spouse"" and unless you suffer from infertility, you probably can find a partner and become a parent at some point in life. So, then if that happens, you get the spouse and child you wanted, you read this book, you say, hey the book really helped me. That is just confirmation bias.If you dream big, you have to take some risks in life. For example, if you want to make money with high-risk investments, you need to be prepared to fail as well, and this book is not for you. You actually need to read  and understand how stock markets work. That is getting real financial education. People who become wealthy from nothing, usually worked really hard, failed and rose up again. They did not read a book of wishful thinking, pretended to be rich and a million-dollar idea came to them in a dream. Well, maybe there is one person this happened to, but it not highly probable.If your goal is something unattainable, like winning the lottery, there is great probability it will not happen because very few people do win the lottery, so you have to be realistic to lower your expectations from life to actually get something that is reachable from where you sit. This creates confirmation bias, and sadly people cannot see it and don’t admit that about themselves. They just say “ I don’t want lottery winnings; I don’t need it” .”Grapes are sour” said the fox when she could not reach them.According to this book, if you want to win the lottery, you just need to wish it, pretend you are rich, worship the rich, act like them, pretend you’re one of them, and you don’t even have to buy the lottery ticket, it will come to you as a gift because of your positive thinking.Many people want to be right; they want to feel lucky and they want to feel that the universe, or God, thinks they are special and they don’t want to accept that life is just random and that we are really just tiny insignificant specks of dust in the great scheme of the infinite universe.People like to believe in meritocracy: I have what I have because I deserve it. I worked hard for it, and to some reading books such as this, means working hard for what they attain. Rich people are rich because they deserve it. I am not rich because I probably don’t deserve it. I have high degrees and a high paying job because I deserve it. So on. A lot of things are just random, like opportunities in life, accidents, violent crime victims,  for instance.It is true though that unhealthy envy is wasted energy, a good dose of healthy envy is what people need to try harder to attain their goals. This is true of course, but I don’t need to buy this book to know that. I can just read an article on Psychology today for free.\n\n', ""\n\n  This book contains great information about how different classes of people view money. I have learned a lot and have taken action and it has changed my live. However,,,,The author talks about his seminars ever chance he gets, its almost as if once he finishes explaining something he just has to tell you about his seminar. The problem with this is that it makes the reader think they are dependent on going to this seminar and won't get rich if they don't.\n\n"", ""\n\n  The approach of the author in this book is really different and unique from other books with similar topic out there.

Awesome book if you can apply his advice to your life; but your a dreamer if you think after reading this book, money is going to fall in your lap.\n\n', ""\n\n  Well structured and easy to read. Some content is not new if you have read other popular books on self-help but this book stillstands out and you will enjoy it if you don't try to be too critical. Lots of good advice to follow.

  Rex “TW” McMurtry’s perpetual single-hood wouldn’t bother him so much if all his ex-girlfriends didn’t keep marrying the very next person they dated, especially when so many of those grooms are his closest friends. He may be a pro-football defensive end for the Chicago Squalls, but the press only wants to talk about how he’s always a groomsman and never a groom.

She’s dated. Once. And once was more than enough. Privy to all the sad stories of her customers, ‘contentment over commitment’ is her motto, and Abby is convinced no one on earth could ever entice her into a romantic relationship . . . except that one guy she’s loved since preschool.The guy who just walked into her bar.The guy who doesn’t recognize her.The guy who is drunk and needs a ride home.The guy who has a proposition she should definitely refuse.

  The 1948 crime film The Naked City (later a television show) ended with this iconic line There are eight million stories in the naked city.” Things have not changed either before or since: every era and neighborhood is full of true tales and legends about which even residents are likely to be unaware. Strange And Obscure Stories Of New York City takes the reader on a breathtaking tour of the five boroughs in search of these accounts. Some are eerily fascinating in their own right while others explain how the city became the great metropolis that it is.Before the World Trade Center 9/11 tragedy, the aftermath of a fire aboard the steamboat General Slocum in the East River was the city’s greatest disaster. The 1904 event occurred during an outing for a church group. The loss of life1,021 out of the 1,358 passengersdevastated the German-America community that inhabited Manhattan’s East Village. To escape bad memories, they relocated to the Upper East Side’s Yorkville, the reason why that neighborhood became celebrated for its German restaurants, stores, and breweries.On July 23, 1886, not long after the Brooklyn Bridge opened, a 23-year-old named Steve Brodie announced that he survived a 150-foot drop from that span into the East River. (A liquor dealer offered to back a saloon that Brodie wanted to open but only if he took the risk). Although there were no witnesses, news of the alleged jump made headlines, with The New York Times supporting Brodie’s claim, and the phrase pull a Brodie,” meaning to try a dangerous stunt, entering popular parlance.Then too are the unsolved murders, ghost stories, urban legends (are there indeed alligators living in the sewers?), and hidden histories that are all part of this lively and captivating chronicle of the world’s greatest city.Skyhorse Publishing, as well as our Arcade imprint, are proud to publish a broad range of books for readers interested in history--books about World War II, the Third Reich, Hitler and his henchmen, the JFK assassination, conspiracies, the American Civil War, the American Revolution, gladiators, Vikings, ancient Rome, medieval times, the old West, and much more.

I absolutely adored this story!.Our heroine Claire is a widow with three wonderful kids she doesn’t have time for love or a relationship, what she had with her husband is unforgettable she misses him dearly and everyday seems to be harder, he should be here. Helping her. Now on the verge of bankruptcy her husbands company is falling under she catches the eye of Tristan the biggest business Mogul who takes company’s and rips them apart then builds them back up again. She hates him. He’s cocky, conceited and she doesn’t want him anywhere near her husbands company, especially when one look from him makes her stomach sink, and her body come alive she knows it’s a bad idea.

And what he wants is Claire. There is definitely more than meets the eye when it comes to her and he wants to take his time getting under the surface and getting her under him. So when fate sends them to the same conference in Paris this is the perfect time to test this mutual attraction.

I hate it when writers think their audience is stupid and write characters whose actions are so ridiculous that they are impossible to believe. Let's put aside the fact that the heroine takes constant crap from her family and says absolutely nothing about it. Let's also ignore the fact that anything to deal with romance throughout the book reads like badly scripted porn - really, really bad porn. The fact that Hunter who was a marine and co-founder of a security company is so blind that he cannot see what is so clearly in front of his face is just plain ridiculous. No one in charge of a billion dollar company is that stupid even if they have taken a 12 year hiatus to raise a child - another ridiculous point. Most parents work while raising their children, and are able to come to a nice home/work balance.  They also manage to accomplish this without an 8 figure bank account.

I truthfully thought that her family looked down on her because of her past experience dating her professor and her unsuccessful dating history since then. But it wasn't until her father lovingly called her an earthquake that I realized their concern was based out of love and wanting to see her happy .Then there is Lina's past history with her professor and the rumors that swirled around her and plagued her and made her feel so much less than she was. And the professor gave zero sh*ts about her feelings.The paralell (spoiler!!) That happens with thus scenario at the end of the book is just *chefs kiss!*And do NOT even get me started on Gerald. He infuriated me so much that when my husband interrupted me mid-read I actually snapped at him. I had to take a moment to realize that I was mad at Gerald and not my actual life.Aaron and Lina were just this great modern couple tackling such REAL life issues. Aaron is the kind of man that men should aspire to be! A supportive, caring partner who treats a woman as his equal and lifts her up\n\n"", '\n\n  I think this book was figging fantastic, it had me crying, laughing cringing 💀. I even through my phone across the room and dented the wall :/ but nevertheless it was so much fun I LOVE FREAKING AARON and Lina (ofc) but I think this man has a holddd one me. this book had it moments ( cringe dirty talk but whatever) however I loved the writing the niche references really did it for me. OU AND THE TENSION. TOP.TIER. the characters especially Lina felt realistic with there struggles and not push to force drama. Also the family in the book was 😘, the blatant love between everyone was perfect I could feel it through the book. UGH and I loved the spainsh in here even learned I few words myself.🤪BUT everything between the tension, banners and love story was amazing and i think I found a new fav. So tiktok recs do have my turth in em ;)\n\n', '\n\n  There was so much hype about this book that I was nervous about reading it.  There has only been a few books that have fulfilled my expectations and “The Spanish Love Deception” is now added to this list.This story made me cringe, laugh out loud, giggle, and made my heart ache and rejoice throughout the story.The two main characters (Catalina and Aaron) were so much fun to read about that I could totally imagine this book as a movie.I want to read it again to savor the characters and cheer them on.Thanks to the author, Elena Armas, for bringing to life to heartwarming story of Catalina and Aaron.  It was Perfection!\n\n', '\n\n  This was a great fake dating, office enemies to lovers romance. I thought that Lina was hilarious. The book had me laughing from the first few pages. I love the witty banter between Aaron and Lina. I found the book to be somewhat of a slow burn. The author really makes you wait for the couple to get together. Overall this was a really good book. I would recommend it to those who enjoy romantic comedies.The best part of the book was every time Aaron would call Lina ""baby""...swoon.\n\n', '\n\n  Okay wow! Lina & Aaron!! I’m obsessed, and this book was incredible. This is an enemies-to-lovers, fake-dating romance and my gosh, it’s perfect. This is a slow burn and it’s SO worth it. It’s a fairly large book and I read it in two days. The writing quality of the author made this book so easy to devour.Catalina Martin is an engineer team lead at a firm in NYC. She desperately needs a date for her sisters wedding back in Spain where all her family is. In walks the 6’4 blue-eyed pain in her ass co-worker, Aaron Blackford. He inserts himself as her only option. But he’s the bane of her existence. This can’t go right, can it?Please run to read this. It’s SO good! PLUS, the author just announced she is working on a second book for one of the side characters, Lina’s best friend, Rosie! Give me all the steamy-romancy-bickering-love. I’m hooked.\n\n', '\n\n  I was looking for a slow burn contemporary multi-cultural romance and wow, did this book deliver!The slow evolution of the relationship burned so hot!  The characters are lovely and the mix of American and Spanish brings an interesting flavor to the story.  It’s also funny.I highly recommend it.  Expect to not be able to put it down once you start.  It’s that good.\n\n', ""\n\n  I was super excited to read this book because of all the great reviews, but I was quickly disappointed within the first five pages. It takes four pages for the main character to just simply turn around and I can't think of any point in the novel where I was actually enjoying it. If this hadn't been the book my book club selected, I probably would have stopped reading long ago. Plot is similar to Hating Game, but carries none of the enjoyable qualities. The main character, Catalina, has long drawn out thoughts that cover pages and simple conversations take forever to be finished. There are a lot of plot holes or points that never get brought up again. Way too many cliches that doesn't really work in the favour of the book or its characters. Honestly, this book could have been condensed into 200-300 pages instead of the 400 something that it is. The 'problem' in the novel isn't focused on enough to even feel sympathy towards the MC, and only adds to the annoyance of the reader. Really tried my all to enjoy it but can't say i did at all.\n\n""]"

I’m in deeper than I could have known, and now there’s no going back.When blood spilled, I ran at the first chance I got. That was my biggest mistake. Do. Not. Run.It’s been drilled into my head since the moment they took me.A searing bullet through the chest is enough to seal my fate, and no matter how much I scream, they refuse to believe my innocence. They’re out for blood and they won’t stop until they’ve watched the life fade from my eyes.These heathens are nothing but the callous, cruel monsters the world has always known them to be and they hold every last card between their devious fingers. Their own flesh and blood fear them. They’ve locked them away for the greater good, but they won’t be kept down, not anymore.This war just took a turn for the worst and navigating my way to freedom might just cost me my life.

I definitely went in search for a lipstick just like that.Onto the book… Sheridan has done it again. After needing to recover from that book one  cliffhanger I dove right into this book the minute it hit my Kindle. Those first few chapters… My heart just didn’t know how to feel. I was a mix of emotions, especially after getting to know the characters in book one.As the story continues I thought my emotions were beginning to settle (spoiler alert, probably not smart). We finally got little glimpses of the guys pasts, which I had been waiting for. There were some big moves being made and, of course, some twists and turns. I’m not sure if the ending was a complete shock because we were given a few hints earlier in the book. However, I think it was a pretty decent emotional cliffhanger. I think that when the events are revealed to the other characters it’s going to be explosive.This book’s release date was brought up earlier than planned and I can’t help hope that book 3 might be as well (hopeful thinking but no pressure of course). Sheridan is great at dragging you into her books and slowly letting you go in pieces. Definitely one of my 1-Click authors.\n\n', ""\n\n  Oh my goodness! We're only on book 2 of 4 and Sheridan is serving up a whole darn FEAST. If bow was the debut, then Depraved Sinners is only further evidence of her way to mastery in the dark RH romance genre.I am so impressed with the plot, the action, and the sheer DEPTH of these characters. Just when you think you couldn't dislike a character any more than you did in the first book, BAM! A drop of backstory that leaves you hanging and confused about your newfound affections... looking at a certain dark and Depraved male character...There is so much to unpack with this book, especially after the cliffy from book one. Sheridan hits the ground running in the beginning of Heathens and ends things on an even larger scale cliffhanger that made me simultaneously want to curse her and kiss her feet for the absolute genius (and diabiloical) events.Overall, I think this is quickly shaping up to be my favourite series!\n\n"", ""\n\n  My brain needed a minute after that ending because of all the things I thought would happen this wasn't even on my radar! Heathens picks up where Psychos finishes and I can honestly say I'm glad nothing was missed or unturned while writing book 2.The development of the DeAngelis brothers was so captivating and intense I loved the moments they showed how vulnerable and real they are.The fact that their past was actually spoken about and not brushed under the rug made me so emotionally attached I just devoured all of it.The development of each character and how they choose to present themselves makes me want to be right there with them for every messed up twist and turn Sheridan throws at them.The story line of this book was darker and I honestly loved seeing this side of Sheridan's writing abilities.Honestly my undying love for Marcus is untouchable and he's pretty high up on my book boyfriend list and I'm ready for the rest of the redemption in book 3.\n\n"", '\n\n  I feel completely and utterly wrecked after finishing this book! I feel like Sheridan truly loves to torture her readers. My heart was in my throat through the entire book. It’s like sitting in a hurricane and waiting for the wind to tear your house apart. That’s what this book is a perfect storm that in the end will leave you hanging. I knew she would leave us asking so many questions but really?? Gawd! I can’t wait for the next book in this series. Marcus, Roman, Levi and Shayne are in for an even bumpier ride.\n\n', '\n\n  First off Thank you Sheridan Anne for allowing me to have an advanced reader copy!Heathens was excellent from start to finish. My original cliffhanger was answered but of course she does me dirty with another cliffhanger but that’s why I love her writing so much.The story continues with Shayne being her bad ass self. Like she is a bad ass mother “trucking” girl. She learns more about the DeAngelis brothers. You also get some POV from the guys which is an perfect addition to the book.Drums 🥵 Rooftop 🥵 will be living in my head rent free.Can Savages comes out now?!\n\n', '\n\n  This book was absolutely freaking amazing!Heathens picked up right where book one left off and had me entertained right to the very end. The FMC, Shayne, is quick witted and her smart mouth and inner dialogue is hilarious.The cliffhanger destroyed me and left me wanting more. If you love action packed, mafia based RH than this is a definite must read!\n\n', '\n\n  AHHHH. So good. Sheridans writing is always so full of suspense and I love the characters! This series is a tad darker then boys of winter, that being said… I’m LOVING IT! I love how these books end in cliff hangers because you are wanting … no, NEEDING MORE!!!! I am so honoured to be a part of the ARC team, thank you so much Sheridan, for letting me be one of the firsts to read your book!!\n\n', '\n\n  An amazing read! I could not put it down!

From someone who\'s read many books of higher level reading and intensity such as LOTR, Dune, Ender\'s Game, etc.... I just don\'t get the hype.  There\'s really not a lot of plot.

Both the books and the amazing poetry that’s so fitting at the end of each novel.\n\n', '\n\n  I’m so happy to see the story arc. All the story building in the last two books, the peeks into Aurens past are so enlightening, giving you more and more understanding into why she is the way she is. It’s very interesting to see moreover the rulers and the special powers they have. And having Auren come into her own… struggling with staying in her lane, the type of life she has always known and rebelling but still trying to keep those she truly cares for safe. I loved the dynamic between Auren and Slade. You could see him wanting her to become her own force, to be strong. Absolutely amazing!\n\n', ""\n\n  Oh boy oh boy!! I know it's a great story when I read too late into the night and suffer a book hangover for 2 days running. Sleep was much less appealing then finishing this book and to see how it all plays out. Royal scheming, power plays, revenge, assassination, and of course the too often trampling of the innocent pawns too often sacrificed in the name of the king or queen. Auren's emerging backbone may be fierce, but is it strong enough to avoid the pitfalls of being a magical golden saddle to the evil King Midas. A great story!!!\n\n"", '\n\n  I binged this series and I HAVE ALL THE FEELINGS. So many things happened in this book, so many unresolved issues in Auren’s life finally come to a head for better or for worse. The entire third act of this book wrecked me. I’m now devastated I have to wait a year for the next book. Like an idiot, I assumed it was a trilogy without actually checking. I can’t recommend this series enough though. The characters are so well done and the character growth is fantastic.\n\n', ""\n\n  Excellent plot and character development. At times I wanted story to move along a bit quicker and get to the epic romance, however the slow build made the wait worthwhile. The author  created mood and lead the reader right along with Auren's emotions. I'm so glad that some of the tension was resolved in the end as the last part of the book had me hanging on the proverbial edge of my seat.\n\n"", ""\n\n  Wow wow wow! And here I was not knowing this was more than a trilogy, quite upset that I have to wait until May???These books will not stop with the surprise reveals every few chapters! Everytime you think you know what's up a new plot point comes out of nowhere and changes the game!! By far the best in the series so far! We love a pissed off, murderous female lead with stabby tendencies 🎉 also 🌶️🌶️🌶️ on point after two books of cringey non-con situations (story relevant but still 😬) this book delivered with some blush worthy content. 1000/10 recommend, please someone devour this series and then hit me up to discuss! This series needs more hype!!\n\n"", '\n\n  Well damn, this was one hell of a Journey.Amazing. The whole going from meek and caged to a true force to reckoned with. To find out what being accepted for who you are. To figure out that you hold the power- you just have to take control over your destiny. The trauma, thr emotions, I loved every minute... well minus Queen Malina. I hope that ice Queen gets either a proper redemption.. or an end fitting the hatred she spews.  I Cannot wait for the next one.\n\n', ""\n\n  Wow, just. WOW! The third book in the Plated Prisoner Series is EPIC! Full of action, secrets, plot twists and more, so much more! Abd the fourth goes out in may 2022? I'm gonna die before that!!! It was so good, I cried, I laughed, I swooned! If you havent start reading this series you should!\n\n""]"

GeissingerSloane has a sister?!?  I didn’t quite know what to do with this new revelation! Sloane has a younger sister and the biggest traits they share are button pushing and their very warped, very funny, very wordy sense of humor. Just imagine the two of them in the same room….I’m warning you be prepared!Riley is somewhat of a recluse, geesh she has Sloane for a sister, of course she would be. However, that doesn’t stop her from giving you her opinion and I’m not sure who told her to use her words, as she does that in spades. Savage Hearts could actually flow right over into romantic comedy at some points. The action starts as Riley arrives for a visit with Sloane and Declan. This is where the story really begins.From a blonde haired Irishman named Spider to a “Ghost” who appears to be able to walk through walls, Riley has one heck of a journey beginning.Beloved (well maybe only by Natalie) Kage has decided to send an assassin Declan’s way. Such a nice man! NOT! This is how we meet Malek; his mission to “remove” Declan, who was responsible for Malek’s brother’s death. However, his first meeting with Riley kinda sends him for a loop.Sit yourself down and get comfortable, Malek and Riley are one of those opposites attract couples, Riley also brings something new to Malek’s life, hope, inspiration and maybe he will learn that forgiveness can help heal past hurts.We get to visit with Sloane and Declan of course, Spider (who is Riley’s bodyguard) Kage and Natalie and a Russian Pakhan, a crow and there might be a bear.What we get story wise is priceless; lots of humor, surprises, safe houses, traveling and show down that could blow this story wide open. I loved every minute, every laugh, the odd tear and being a part of what one person named Riley could show our Monsters! On top of this we find out who our next Monster will be.\n\n', '\n\n  I can’t get enough of this series! This book was surprising and a real turning point in the series.Riley has been summoned for a visit by her almost estranged sister and when she arrives she’s thrust into a world of crime and lavish lifestyle she’s never seen before. Turns out that’s what happens when your sister is involved with the Irish Mob.Malek is seeking vengeance for his brother’s death and comes across Riley along the way. He’s the ultimate killer who everyone fears but he can’t turn away from Riley.Riley made this book for me. She’s a spitfire and the banter between her and Malek was top notch. She gave as good as she got and had real inner strength.Their chemistry is undeniable and intense. the sex scenes are so hot, as expected from the extremely talented J.T. Geissinger.This was a captivating read with lots of details that sometimes left my mind spinning but they’re all there for a reason. I feel like this book is setting the tone and direction for the series as a whole. Certain storylines got tied up and seeds for new ones have been planted. I cannot wait for the next book!!! Spider has been an important character for two books now and he definitely deserves to find his true crime partner.\n\n', '\n\n  I agree with all of the other reader’s comments about Mal & Riley - LOVE THEM, especially Riley. She is an interesting character! The storyline was intriguing & kept you hooked. I did not want to put this book down. I also enjoyed the way Ms Geissinger brought other characters back: Kage, Nat, Declan, Sloane & Killian! It was interesting how they appeared & we got their perspectives throughout the book. Also, big thanks for the summary Nat & Sloane gave to Riley - that helped refresh the previous books & provided a bit of the forgotten history. This is an excellent book & I cannot wait to read ‘Brutal Vows’ & Spider’s adventure(s). Highly recommend this book, but it must be read in order to fully understand the storyline.\n\n', ""\n\n  Savage Hearts is the third book in the Queens & Monsters series. It follows Riley and Malek. There's a little miscommunication between them at the start of the book, which was so funny! It really set the tone of the book. Riley has been living in the shadows of her prettier and more popular sister, so she's always felt like insecure about her looks. Malek is out for revenge, but when he sees Riley his whole mission is derailed. I won't give it away but this book so much fun, and the spice was on fire! Highly recommend!\n\n"", '\n\n  Not going to lie didn’t really warm up to Riley till atleast half way through.  Riley is a know it all who assumes if you don’t talk in three syllable words you’re dense.  Mal is not the typical Bratva soldier and I loved it. I also enjoyed the semi love triangle. It’s most definitely a slow burn but when we do get to the scenes it’s all kinds of hot. This of course isn’t the end to this series and I’m so ready for the next story in this mobs/mafia/bratva saga.\n\n', '\n\n  This is the third book of the Queens & Monsters series, I read the other two and absolutely loved them. This book takes the cake. Our main girl is a tiny, fierce, sarcastic, hilarious woman. Her quips and remarks had me laughing the entire book.Our main man is a hot as hell, alpha male, but he has a dark past that lead him to where he is and the growth of his character is truly amazing. Malik is my favourite of all the men in these books so far.The storyline is incredible, it never drags. It’s constantly either action, sexy scenes, all the feels or just down right hilarious. The sex scenes are on fire, scorching hot and so well written.The epilogue gives us a peek at the next book and I’m a mix of sad that I have to wait until next year and a mix of ridiculously excited to read this story.It’s perfect. So freaking perfect 😍\n\n', '\n\n  This was a good continuation of JT Geissinger’s Queens and Monsters series.It fell with some of the story, but I did enjoy Mail’s stealthiness.  There was a lot of hype with the storyline regarding Sloane’s and Riley’s sister relationship and it fell short with how that played out.I had wished the spicy scenes were as good as the other books in the series, but this fell short too.\n\n']"

  Book Three of The Guardians Series“You scared her away!” Ellie accused, and Sean realized she was angry.“I nearly broke my bleedin’ neck,” he protested.“Couyon!” Her voice rose. “You’re being ridiculous.” “I barely caught myself,” he insisted. “That monster tree of yours almost took me out!”“This is my home—you need to leave.”“But I just got here.”“You weren’t invited!”“Which I won’t take personally, even though we’re partners and all.”“Partners?” The disbelief on her face was almost comical. “We are not partners!”“Sure we are. You heard Stuart. In tandem. You know what tandem means, don’t you, love?”She pointed at the door. “Go away, Irishman!”“McDougal,” he corrected. “But you can call me Sean.” “Que diriez-vous je vous appelle un idiot!” she snarled, only part of which he understood—idiot translated well enough—and then she closed her eyes and took a deep, ragged breath. Then another. Then she took a careful step back, as if she’d suddenly found herself standing at some dangerous, unknown precipice.Dousing the fire, he thought, oddly disappointed. “I’ve turned my ankle,” he continued, just to poke at her. He limped back a step. “I’ll need to ice it.”Her eyes opened. Fell to his booted foot.“Might be fractured,” he added.“You are a strange and frustrating man,” she said.“Aye,” he agreed somewhat apologetically and smiled at her.★★★     After Ellie Broussard saves Sean McDougal’s son from drowning, she walks away, unwilling to involve herself with the rakish Irishman and his charming boy.  Ellie has suffered a devastating loss, and her world is one of chosen isolation and calculated vengeance.  She has only one focus: to find the monster that stole her child and turn his world to ash.         Sean can relate to Ellie’s suffering.  Having lost his wife to cancer, his sole focus has become raising his boy, and love…well, love can take a long walk.  He’s in Louisiana to locate a cache of stolen art, and even if he’s taken aback—and reluctantly intrigued—by the mysterious and chilly Ellie Broussard, he knows better than to tumble down that rabbit hole.      But when they’re thrown together on assignment to recover the cache, Sean and Ellie have no choice but to put aside their mutual misgivings and work side by side.  To share; to trust; to discover they are not as separate as they appear. And as Ellie’s deadly hunt approaches its culmination, they must risk everything they hold dear to stop a murderer who is readying his next strike, and to save an orphaned girl whose only hope lies in their willingness to defy the darkness and step into the light.★★★★★""A brilliant book with lots of raw emotion, well written, packed with action and brutal honesty.

I really didn’t know much going in other than some video reviews I saw - some positive, some negative.This book is basically just sex, blood and gore. It’s reverse harem meaning one woman and multiple men (4 in this case). There’s really not much plot to the book other than a woman being sold by her father to pay a debt (not a spoiler, it’s in the book description).The book isn’t poorly written but it’s very repetitive and there doesn’t seem to be much substance. If you have a sensitive stomach or don’t handle violence/abuse/assault and very graphic sex scenes, then I would say this book isn’t for you.I just wish there was more to this book. It starts out promising with the female lead acting really tough but she seems to deflate very quickly. Yes, she’s strong and gets her own way but her personality and “quirks” become flat and she just seems to fade into the personality of the men.There’s no redemption, which is fine I like a grey book, but some of the aspects for the characters seem thrown in to make the characters more likeable? It doesn’t seem to jive with the rest of their personalities.Basically this book is just sex scenes, constantly. I don’t think it adds to the book.

Not to mention the girl’s character goes from I HATE EVERYONE to complete desperation for sleeping with all 4 guys.The book seems like it’s written from a male perspective where the woman is thin yet curvy big boobs, tiny waist, and yet a hug ass.. and the smut is just cringe more than hot.Anyways, to sum it up, it definitely got me out of my reading slump as now I can go back to actual good written books with a plot.

If u don’t mind that then I would recommend this book but if you want there to be a rly nice plot then I don’t recommend getting this book. I will not lie I really like the characters.

  Why is it so hard to make lasting changes in our companies, in our communities, and in our own lives?The primary obstacle is a conflict that's built into our brains, say Chip and Dan Heath, authors of the critically acclaimed bestseller Made to Stick. Psychologists have discovered that our minds are ruled by two different systems - the rational mind and the emotional mind - that compete for control. The rational mind wants a great beach body; the emotional mind wants that Oreo cookie. The rational mind wants to change something at work; the emotional mind loves the comfort of the existing routine. This tension can doom a change effort - but if it is overcome, change can come quickly.In Switch, the Heaths show how everyday people - employees and managers, parents and nurses - have united both minds and, as a result, achieved dramatic results:● The lowly medical interns who managed to defeat an entrenched, decades-old medical practice that was endangering patients● The home-organizing guru who developed a simple technique for overcoming the dread of housekeeping ● The manager who transformed a lackadaisical customer-support team into service zealots by removing a standard tool of customer service In a compelling, story-driven narrative, the Heaths bring together decades of counterintuitive research in psychology, sociology, and other fields to shed new light on how we can effect transformative change. Switch shows that successful changes follow a pattern, a pattern you can use to make the changes that matter to you, whether your interest is in changing the world or changing your waistline.

So many interesting examples.Longer Take:I just finished reading “Switch” by Chip and Dan Heath and thoroughly enjoyed it.Have you ever said, “I can’t change things, I’m not the boss.”? Or, “We can’t change that, we don’t have the money.”? I’ve certainly said both. If you have to, this book is for you.“Switch” teaches a specific process to implement change. It is predominantly targeted at change within an organization, but could just as easily be applied to life in general. The authors wrote this specifically for people with limited resources and little authority. No more excuses!I especially enjoyed the elephant and rider metaphor used throughout the book.Each one of us has an elephant and a rider in us. The rider is the rational part of our brain and the elephant is emotional. For real change to occur, you have to appeal to both. If you just appeal to the rider, you get a plan but no motivation. If you just appeal to the elephant, you have motivation but no direction. Real change requires convincing them both.This metaphor is then applied to each change principle throughout the book.My favourite part of any business book is the real-life examples. “Switch” does not disappoint in this area. Each chapter and concept includes several interesting examples. Most importantly, the examples made the change process seem achievable. If they can do it, so can I.Reading this as an entrepreneur, I guarantee you will find many useful strategies to help your business (e.g. Check out the “first 2 stamps free” example on page 126)Give this a read. Whether you're looking to implement change in your organization or not, you won’t regret it.Some of My Favourite Quotes:“Knowledge does not change behaviour.” “… ask the question ‘What’s working and how can we do more of it?’ Sounds simple, doesn’t it? Yet, in the real world, this obvious question is almost never asked.”“When you’re at the beginning, don’t obsess about the middle … Just look for a strong beginning and a strong ending and get moving.”“…behavior change happens in highly successful situations mostly by speaking to people’s feelings.”“Trying to fight inertia and indifference with analytical arguments is like tossing a fire extinguisher to someone who’s drowning. The solution doesn’t match the problem.”“…big changes come from a succession of small changes.”“Everything is hard before it is easy.”“We will struggle, we will fail, we will be knocked down – but throughout, we’ll get better, and we’ll succeed in the end. … people will persevere only if they perceive falling down as learning rather than failing.”Druid’s Top Entrepreneurship Lesson: Getting people to change (Employees = Change their behaviour / Customers = Buy a different product), is so much more than implementing the “carrot” or the “stick” (i.e. Reward or punishment). With a specific strategy, there are countless elements around the change that can be “massaged” to make change both palatable and easy (at least easier).\n\n"", ""\n\n  Fantastic, one of the best books I have read in ages. These brothers know what they are talking about if you manage or lead people, its a must. You just have to get past your own biases and mindset and stop and think and apply that they are saying.

If you want to change you change three things: Your rational mind, your emotional mind and your environment (the author however uses the word path).

The points are clear and punctuated with many real-life stories that make this a really easy and enjoyable read.

To cover the full breadth would take a 100 volume collection... it is important to remember what it means to cover this subject in just one book!For that, I believe Heath brothers did a fantastic job, picking up only the key elements and making practical suggestions that have proven results.It is one of those books that you want to read more than once.\n\n', '\n\n  I like the simple way they bring up the theory behind the change and the practical examples which are great stories we can relate to apply in our own personal and work lives.

  The first in an exciting new historical mystery series set in the home of Agatha Christie!Colleen Cambridge's charming and inventive new historical series introduces an unforgettable heroine in Phyllida Bright, fictional housekeeper for none other than famed mystery novelist Agatha Christie. When a dead body is found during a house party at the home of Agatha Christie and her husband Max Mallowan, it's up to famous author's head of household, Phyllida Bright, to investigate...   Tucked away among Devon’s rolling green hills, Mallowan Hall combines the best of English tradition with the modern conveniences of 1930. Housekeeper Phyllida Bright, as efficient as she is personable, manages the large household with an iron fist in her very elegant glove. In one respect, however, Mallowan Hall stands far apart from other picturesque country houses . . .   The manor is home to archaeologist Max Mallowan and his famous wife, Agatha Christie. Phyllida is both loyal to and protective of the crime writer, who is as much friend as employer. An aficionado of detective fiction, Phyllida has yet to find a gentleman in real life half as fascinating as Mrs. Agatha’s Belgian hero, Hercule Poirot. But though accustomed to murder and its methods as frequent topics of conversation, Phyllida is unprepared for the sight of a very real, very dead body on the library floor . . .   A former Army nurse, Phyllida reacts with practical common sense—and a great deal of curiosity. It soon becomes clear that the victim arrived at Mallowan Hall under false pretenses during a weekend party. Now, Phyllida not only has a houseful of demanding guests on her hands—along with a distracted, anxious staff—but hordes of reporters camping outside. When another dead body is discovered—this time, one of her housemaids—Phyllida decides to follow in M. Poirot’s footsteps to determine which of the Mallowans’ guests is the killer. With help from the village’s handsome physician, Dr. Bhatt, Mr. Dobble, the butler, along with other household staff, Phyllida  assembles the clues. Yet, she is all too aware that the killer must still be close at hand and poised to strike again. And only Phyllida’s wits will prevent her own story from coming to an abrupt end . . .     Read more  ","['4.0 out of 5 stars', '5.0 out of 5 stars', '4.0 out of 5 stars', '5.0 out of 5 stars']","['\nMysterious, atmospheric, and delightfully entertaining!\n', '\nEnjoyable Historical Mystery\n', ""\nHistorical Cozy Mystery in Agatha Christie's House!\n"", '\nWorthy of Dame Agatha herself\n']","['\n\n  Murder at Mallowan Hall is a clue-like murder mystery set in England at the home of Max Mallowan and Agatha Christie during the 1930s that features Phyllida Bright, a housekeeper extraordinary who, after stumbling upon the body of a last-minute, previously uninvited guest to the manor, and with a lack of confidence in the local Constable and Scotland Yard inspector sent to investigate the case, endeavours to solve not just one, but ultimately two murders by using her knowledge and love of Hercule Poirot and a little extra help from some of the other members of staff.The prose is descriptive and light. The characters, including the intelligent, independent heroine, are multi-layered, intriguing, and well-developed.

She's not your typical housekeeper, however, and there's a hint of mystery in past too. (Guess we'll have to wait until the next book in the series to find out more!) While there are a few interactions with Agatha, the story does mostly focus on Phyllida's investigations.Due to the number of suspects, I did struggle to keep track of who everyone was. However, I loved the downstairs characters and I look forward to getting to know everyone at Mallowan Hall more in the coming books.I also felt that this cozy was very well researched. There was a lot of detail about how a house was run during this time period. This gave a lot of authenticity to the story. In addition, Cambridge weaved numerous facts and bits of trivia about Agatha Christie throughout the novel. As a long time fan of Agatha’s work, I had a lot of fun uncovering these “Easter eggs.”While there were some slower moments / a bit of repetition, this was a really fun premise and I thoroughly enjoyed this light and cozy historical mystery.\n\n"", '\n\n  What better than a cozy set in a fictional home owned by the real Mr. and Mrs. Mallowan, especially the lady herself?

And see if she will ever get fond of Myrtle.An absolute must read, and reread many times over. That’s how good it was!\n\n']"

It seemed like the author simply strung together a collection of the heinous acts of torture and violence inflicted upon the children and others in this story. It felt like it was written by an amateur, very simplistic language. Just pass on this one.\n\n', '\n\n  Regardless of how you feel about the writing it is a very important book to read. This is a social issue that is rampant. Child abuse is far to commonplace. For those that find it unbelievable, consider yourself blessed that you did not deal with literal horror as a child. For those that find it amazing that people did nothing to help, remember the bystander effect is so very real and you have to remember that you can step up. Child abuse can happen to the kids that you wouldn’t suspect. Don’t take what the parent says at face value, if you have a gut feeling, go further. Don’t convince yourself that it is ok. For those that think they wouldn’t have done what the kids or adults did, be blessed that you have never been a victim of intense manipulation. When you are literally scared for you life, you can do some pretty crazy things. Your mind can do some crazy things. This is a hard book to read but it’s even harder for the kids that live it everyday. So  do your part, read this book and spread awareness because child abuse is so so common.\n\n', '\n\n  This is the story of three sisters, Nikki, Sami and Tori  who survived horrific abuse at the hands of their mother Shelly Knotek, before finally finding their voice and speaking out.It’s hard to read this book and not be angry.  And not just with Shelly, who clearly exhibited signs from an early age that she is messed up, but the adults in her life as well.  She was a cunning and manipulative monster who was able to terrorize so many people, not just her daughters, and get away with it for far too long.  It was heartbreaking to imagine what the victims went through and even harder to imagine someone being so sadistic and heartless.I thought the author did a great job telling the story and I wanted to keep reading and hoping that there would be some justice in the end.\n\n', '\n\n  This was a difficult read. Not so much the subject matter, what happened to these victims is obviously horrible, but because the book was horribly written. This is my first time reading a book by this author, and I won’t be reading anything else by Gregg Olsen. I felt like I was reading a high schooler’s poorly written essay. This book was littered with cheesy sentences and metaphors. It was unorganized and dragged on forever- I just wanted it to be over!! I’m glad I can retire this book and forget about ever reading it! I can’t understand how this book got so many 5 star reviews...\n\n', '\n\n  I couldn’t put the book down! I woke in the middle of the night to continue reading. You get so hooked into the characters and story. Very well written especially since the subject matter was so dark and painful.\n\n', '\n\n  I felt like I needed to give these children the respect of reading this story. Heart breaking. No words to describe the tradgedy.  It was written exceptionally well, and a story that should be heard.\n\n', ""\n\n  It was really good - couldn't put it down - but did need to take breaks as the descriptions of the abuse are quite visceral and disturbing - definite trigger warning!\n\n"", '\n\n  I gave a rating of four because the book was very well written. But did I enjoy it? Not on your life, it was the most depressing story I have ever read, I found myself getting so angry reading it, not understanding how anyone could get away with that kind of sadistic abuse.  It boggles the mind.  But I had to read it in all the way through and that woman did not get what she deserved - they should have thrown away the key!!!!\n\n']"

Some of them will almost certainly return in future instalments in the series; others, sadly, will not. Cannot.I am eagerly looking forward to future novels in this series.Ross Greenwood is a very gifted writer.\n\n', '\n\n  My first experience with the author. Enjoyed it. Looking forward to his next Barton novel. Now on to his earlier work!\n\n', '\n\n  I found the first person piece somewhat annoying at first but soon got into the story and it no longer “bothered” me. A good story and a nice twist\n\n', '\n\n  FANTASTIC\n\n', '\n\n  A little to predictable.\n\n', '\n\n  I was eager to get my hands on this novel, having seen it being discussed all over Goodreads of late. New to the work of Ross Greenwood, I was also interested to see if this might be a new author to add to my ever-growing list of authors to follow. Fifty years ago, a family is gunned down in an apparent form of retribution. Left for dead in the snow, the one survivor plots revenge in an attempt to ensure the family did not die in vain. At present, DI John Barton is working in Peterborough, happy that the crime rate is much lower than in cities like London. As he plans to reconnect with his wife during a needed few days off, he is called to the scene of a crime. A local drug user is found stabbed multiple times in the back, his neck slit. Barton is a little shocked, as this community rarely sees a homicide, but he rushes into action. With few leads, Barton works with his colleagues to determine what must be going on. Meanwhile, the Snow Killer emerges with their own narrative, having exacted revenge for the deaths five decades ago. It would seem that the snow is a form of homicidal aphrodisiac, forcing new and needed victims to meet their end. As the Snow Killer continues to strike, DI Barton tries to piece the murders together, receiving a lead from a long ago ‘cold’ case of a family murdered in the snow. When the pieces fall into place, Barton cannot believe his luck, though there are still a few on the killer’s list and snow is expected in the forecast. A decent police procedural that keeps the reader flipping pages until the climactic ending. Recommended to those who love quick reads that are full of detail, as well as the reader who loves a British crime thriller with a twist.Ross Greenwood does well with this series debut, pulling the reader into the middle of the story from the outset. The novel moves quickly and offers up a great deal of character development, hinting that the next few novels are in the works. DI John Barton proves to be a wonderful cop as well as a dedicated father. However, with these two jobs comes some needed sacrifices at times. With a wife he loves more than life itself, Barton has found a partner who is able to help him balance the rigours of work and three testy children. Barton reveals much in this debut, both personally and through his work, leaving his character development high and forcing the reader to pose many questions. Others within the book offer some slow development, hinting at the need to discover more in future books. Greenwood crafts his characters well and keeps the reader wanting more. The overall plot was well written and the theme proved useful as the narrative progressed. While it was not the most captivating or cliffhanging novel I have read this year, I found it highly entertaining. The mix of short and long chapters keep the reader pushing forward to learn just a little more before the final reveal and the race to the finish. I will return to follow the series, as I am eager to see what Ross Greenwood has in store for Barton and the rest of the Peterborough crew.Kudos, Mr. Greenwood, on this series debut. The premise worked well and I hope to see more exciting adventures in the near future.\n\n', '\n\n  THE SNOW KILLER is the first book in a British Crime Thriller Series by Ross Greenwood featuring Detective Inspector John Barton. This is the second novel I have read by this author, and I can see that it will be well received and appeal to a wide audience, as it combines many different genres.The novel is set in the United Kingdom and opens with a family being gunned down in the snow but one of the children survives. Three years on, that child takes revenge and the Snow Killer is born.

Meanwhile, the murders continue…Has the Snow Killer resurfaced or is this a copycat Snow Killer?This is a race against time and the elements – each time it snows another person dies.The story is told from alternating POV’s, DI Barton and The Snow Killer.This series shows much promise with an intriguing crime story, believable well-developed characters with a final dramatic twist in its tale which will surprise most crime thriller readers. Looking forward to the next book in the series.Many thanks to the author and The Book Club Reviewer Request Group (FB) for my digital copy.\n\n', '\n\n  The Snow Killer is the debut novel for Ross Greenwood’s character DI John Barton. I always love reading the first in a series and watching the authors development with the characters. This author has definitely been added to my “must follow” series. To start we are taken back to 50 years ago and a family is murdered out in the snow, or so the killers think. There was a survivor and the story alternates back and forth between the “Snow Killers” point of view and DI Barton. It took me a bit to wrap my head around a geriatric serial killer but I did and I enjoyed the read.This is a great police procedural with a major helping of revenge to be topped off by some major twists! A quick, easy page turner!Thank you to the publisher and Netgalley for the ARC in exchange for an honest review.\n\n']"

  “Csikszentmihalyi arrives at an insight that many of us can intuitively grasp, despite our insistent (and culturally supported) denial of this truth. That is, it is not what happens to us that determines our happiness, but the manner in which we make sense of that reality. . . . The manner in which Csikszentmihalyi integrates research on consciousness, personal psychology and spirituality is illuminating.” —Los Angeles Times Book ReviewThe bestselling classic that holds the key to unlocking meaning, creativity, peak performance, and true happiness. Legendary psychologist Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi's famous investigations of ""optimal experience"" have revealed that what makes an experience genuinely satisfying is a state of consciousness called flow. During flow, people typically experience deep enjoyment, creativity, and a total involvement with life. In this new edition of his groundbreaking classic work, Csikszentmihalyi (""the leading researcher into ‘flow states’"" —Newsweek) demonstrates the ways this positive state can be controlled, not just left to chance. Flow: The Psychology of Optimal Experience teaches how, by ordering the information that enters our consciousness, we can discover true happiness, unlock our potential, and greatly improve the quality of our lives.

It is basically a state of mind where one is so involved in activity ""that nothing else matters.""I studies psychology in my undergrad, graduating with high Bs and As. So I was surprised that I had a hard time following this book. One much thinner than my textbooks.Why I did not like the book:- Have you hear about point-first writing style? It\'s basically a method to keep the reader engaged by revealing the point/conclusion of a written piece in the early sentences (of the chapter/paragraph) so that the reader would not have to go on a SCAVENGER HUNT for what the writer is trying to say! Seems like Mihaly is not very interested in this method... Why? Because every chapter is overfilled with examples, quotations, and scientific experiments. The over-explanation takes away what the author was trying to get to. There is just so much clutter that it it makes it hard for the reader to understand what the conclusion of the chapter or even the paragraph is!- Be aware that this book does not give a specific, step-by-step plan for achieving a state of flow- I don\'t agree that happiness = flow. There is more life to that to be honest. I don\'t mind being in ""flow"" when studying or working on tasks that I find boring, to have the time past faster per se. But the reality is, the concept does not work like that! So if you are purchasing the book to make your boring chores or student/work life easier, you may want to re-think your purchase.I hope this was helpful! ¯\\(ツ)/¯\n\n', '\n\n  As a flow chaser and experienced through endurance running I can relate with the stories and experiences here.

I opened my Kindle copy of “Flow” last week and was astonished to see how it synthesized my Zen, mindfulness, Greek and Roman Stoic philosophers, Viktor Frankl’s “Man’s Search for Meaning”, Psychology’s stimulus-response conditioning, learning skills like Tai Chi, and much more.The following is  a quote from Flow:“Contrary to what we usually believe, moments like these (Optimal Experience), the best moments in our lives, are not the passive, receptive, relaxing times—although such experiences can be enjoyable, if we have worked hard to attain them. The best moments usually occur when a person’s body or mind is stretched to its limits in a voluntary effort to accomplish something difficult and worthwhile. Optimal experience is thus something we make happen.” (flow, P.3)  For clarification, I inserted  (Optimal Experience).\n\n', '\n\n  A great read on the power of an awareness of consciousness and how we can otherwise become distracted. Very applicable to life and work. A recommended read for leaders and professionals as well as those wanting to better understand why they do the things they do, and how to get the most out of it! This is a book I will go back to again and again.\n\n', '\n\n  I\'ve found that there\'s no middle ground with this book. You either think it\'s a pretentious self-help book hidden under a mask of pseudo-intellectual research, or you become obsessed with achieving the ""Flow"" state. Fortunately, the chances are that you\'ve already experienced it or that you experience it daily. This book provides some context on what Flow state is and gives real-life examples of how people experience it in their way.It won\'t provide a magic recipe for being an ultra-productive, focused human being but it will open up your mind a bit, it won\'t force you to embrace it, it will merely provide some context.\n\n', ""\n\n  I can't recommend this book enough. This book helped me to improve myself and change things I couldn't change as I didn't have the tools before. I bought an electronic copy, then bought a physical copy for my GF and another physical copy for my close family, as I'm convinced they really should read it.\n\n"", '\n\n  Pros: Well researched, well-written book about performance psychology. I would highly recommend this book to those interested in the self-help topic and also to those who want to understand some of the research being done in this field. Cons: The book is getting a bit old and it could use some updates.\n\n', '\n\n  This text is a very insightful glimpse into humanity, purpose and direction.

Newly arrived to Birmingham, Alabama, Jane is a broke dog-walker in Thornfield Estates––a gated community full of McMansions, shiny SUVs, and bored housewives. The kind of place where no one will notice if Jane lifts the discarded tchotchkes and jewelry off the side tables of her well-heeled clients. Where no one will think to ask if Jane is her real name.But her luck changes when she meets Eddie Rochester. Recently widowed, Eddie is Thornfield Estates’ most mysterious resident. His wife, Bea, drowned in a boating accident with her best friend, their bodies lost to the deep. Jane can’t help but see an opportunity in Eddie––not only is he rich, brooding, and handsome, he could also offer her the kind of protection she’s always yearned for. Yet as Jane and Eddie fall for each other, Jane is increasingly haunted by the legend of Bea, an ambitious beauty with a rags-to-riches origin story, who launched a wildly successful southern lifestyle brand. How can she, plain Jane, ever measure up? And can she win Eddie’s heart before her past––or his––catches up to her?With delicious suspense, incisive wit, and a fresh, feminist sensibility, The Wife Upstairs flips the script on a timeless tale of forbidden romance, ill-advised attraction, and a wife who just won’t stay buried. In this vivid reimagining of one of literature’s most twisted love triangles, which Mrs. Rochester will get her happy ending?

I think I need to step away from domestic suspense novels. Reading Harlan Coben novels, I loved that idea of every day people getting caught up in scary and suspenseful things. It becomes very relatable as you could be the protagonist in the story. With the success of ""Gone Girl"", the trend of twist endings and shock value have saturated most suspense novels. It either becomes formulaic with it ending this way or that way...or an implausible ending just to make it different. I feel like for me, it\'s more about the plot and characters and not just the twist and turns. I am still enjoying historical mysteries, romantic suspense and police procedural so it\'s not the mystery genre I am growing tired with. Sorry for the ramble, but this is just the baggage that is coming with me as I read this one. In the 23% I read of this novel, I did not get invested at all, so I decided to stop reading. With the Jane Eyre story, you sort of know where it\'s going and I just wanted to forward to when it\'s all new.***I received a complimentary copy of this ebook/audiobook from the publisher through NetGalley. Opinions expressed in this review are entirely my own.*** (\n\n', ""\n\n  Hmmm....I thought the premise was good, having taking some inspiration from Jane Eyre. I was curious to see what Hawkins had come up with.I found each and every character to be unlikable. Jane isn't a lead that earned any empathy from me at all. She's a conniving user, a thief and a fake, matching much of what she despises about the wealthy residents of Thornfield Estates. I'm okay with having no clear 'good' or redeeming character in a novel, but found the character development missed the mark for me as well. I never bought into the 'romance' between Jane and Eddie at all.Most of the story is told from Jane's point of view. Chapters from Bea do pique the reader/listener's curiosity. I do applaud Hawkins' manipulation of the reader/listener as we hear more from Bea. But again, it was somewhat predictable. I just, well I just expected more I think. More of a fresh story perhaps. The Wife Upstairs ended up being just an okay book for me. Still, this was a good listen while doing some quilting. I'm definitely in the minority on this book.St. Martin's chose to use multiple readers for this book - Emily Shaffer, Kirby Heyborne, Lauren Fortgang. They're all readers I have enjoyed previously and they all did a good job with this novel.\n\n""]"

Suddenly, Bianca sees a future she never imagined—with Ash. But when the bullies from his youth are up to their old tricks, everything they care about is threatened, and it will take a miracle—or a hero—to save the day.The Gift of the MarquessThe Marchioness of Darlington wants nothing more than a child, but after three years of marriage, Poppy has given up hope.

Ash isn’t quite a full-on gothic hero, he’s just too sweet, but he does share many of their defining traits. He’s a bit of a loner with a tragic backstory and the love of the right woman makes him even greater than he already was. I enjoyed reading about this group of characters and I’m looking forward to learning more about them in the next book.The Gift of the MarquessWow. There’s quite a lot going on here. And for anyone who has struggled with fertility issues, this story could be considered slightly triggering. Poppy and Gabriel are fantastic characters. Having been married for several years now, they’ve already made it past most of the worst miscommunication problems that often plague the newly wedded. That doesn’t mean their journey is all smooth sailing though; they still have their moments of ‘humans behaving badly’ where they don’t talk the issues through. No matter what else is going on, it’s easy to feel the love these two have for one another. I thought their emotional vulnerability came across as very realistic and I loved that both characters had growth they needed to accomplish. I felt that their issues resolved a bit too easily, but I realize that it happens that way in real life on a fairly regular basis. I’m dying to see what happens in the next book now.Joy to the DukeWhat a fascinating twist on A Christmas Carol. Calder and Felicity had the last ten years of their happiness stolen from them when his father schemed to keep them apart. My heart broke for this pair over the grief and pain caused by the old duke, but I loved watching all the trouble Felicity went to in order to thaw Calder’s heart back out. And in a scene worthy of The Grinch, we even witness Chill’s heart grow three sizes by the end. Now I’m kind of sad to say “goodbye” to these siblings and their extended families.I received complimentary copies of the books in the set.\n\n']"

  “The reigning queen of historical fiction” --  Fiona Davis, New York Times bestselling author of The Lions of Fifth Avenue  The New York Times and USA  Today bestselling author of The Huntress and The Alice Network returns  with another heart-stopping World War II story of three female code breakers  at Bletchley Park and the spy they must root out after the war is over.1940. As England prepares to fight the Nazis, three very different women answer the call to mysterious country estate Bletchley Park, where the best minds in Britain train to break German military codes. Vivacious debutante Osla is the girl who has everything—beauty, wealth, and the dashing Prince Philip of Greece sending her roses—but she burns to prove herself as more than a society girl, and puts her fluent German to use as a translator of decoded enemy secrets. Imperious self-made Mab, product of east-end London poverty, works the legendary codebreaking machines as she conceals old wounds and looks for a socially advantageous husband. Both Osla and Mab are quick to see the potential in local village spinster Beth, whose shyness conceals a brilliant facility with puzzles, and soon Beth spreads her wings as one of the Park’s few female cryptanalysts. But war, loss, and the impossible pressure of secrecy will tear the three apart.  1947. As the royal wedding of Princess Elizabeth and Prince Philip whips post-war Britain into a fever, three friends-turned-enemies are reunited by a mysterious encrypted letter--the key to which lies buried in the long-ago betrayal that destroyed their friendship and left one of them confined to an asylum. A mysterious traitor has emerged from the shadows of their Bletchley Park past, and now Osla, Mab, and Beth must resurrect their old alliance and crack one last code together. But each petal they remove from the rose code brings danger--and their true enemy--closer...

It was by no means a quick read, but it was epic and heartfelt. It is a remarkable work of historical fiction and will be one of my top picks for 2021, if not of all time. I am traditionally a fan of heroic WWII sagas, but I enjoyed that this didn’t put us on the frontlines or in the shoes of those living through an invasion, but brought us behind the scenes, so to speak, and into the heart of valiant warriors in their own right. I found it to be an absolutely fascinating masterpiece that brought me to laughter, tears, and frustration. It will be worth a re-read one day, and in all honestly, I’m having a difficult time leaving Bletchley Park behind.For transparency, I started listening via a gifted audiobook from HarperAudio via NetGalley.

Quinn takes us to England in 1940.  Three different women are selected to work at what they discover to be Bletchley Park as codebreakers.  Wealthy deb Osla (dating Prince Philip no less), Mab-a girl from the rough part of town, and Beth-a girl demeaned by her overbearing mother who believes she is stupid.  The girls all find their niche at Bletchley.  While they work on breaking the impossible Enigma machine codes, there is a spy in their midst.  This book was so well written, the characters so well developed and the storyline clipped along, I enjoyed the read so much.  I hated to see the end of the book as I felt like I was saying goodbye to friends I had enjoyed getting to know.  Quinn just keeps on getting better with every book.  A great read.\n\n"", ""\n\n  Yeah wow!  I expected this tale to be as genuine and gripping as Quinn's previous novels, but was disappointed. She developed her characters well (some patterned after real historic people) and captured life at Bletchley Park well (which is incredibly well documented from many sources). But the execution was lacking, the drive to excitement lacking, and most of all the conclusion was unlinked from the prior storyline; could all of those people have magically come together - evading local police, MI-5, sanitarium personnel, other folks who had sworn an oath of secrecy - to resolve the conflict which one main character found herself embroiled in???\n\n"", ""\n\n  Great book.  Second best for Kate after The Alice Network.  I loved it.  Listen to the Betchley Park podcasts (UK) if you want the actual history behind it.  This is such an exciting and important time in the history of women's contribution to WWII effort.  It is AMAZING what young women did during the war.  Feminism didn't start in the 1970s.  It started here.  Kate Quinn never fails to bring history to you.  It must have been such an incredible experience to have done what they did.  There are so many stories of women's contributions.  Quinn's books transport you and you become so engrossed in the story.  She is a very compelling writer.\n\n"", '\n\n  This is one of the best books I have read in years.  Utterly amazing.  The characters were well written - easy to ""see"" and ""hear.""  The story line is fascinating.  There were many times within the book that my heart was racing in anticipation as I tore through a particular section to see how it would turn out.\n\n', ""\n\n  The Rose Code is of the best books I've read in a long time. I've read The Alice Network and The Huntress, as well, and loved both, but I think this is my favourite Kate Quinn novel. Initially, I was slow to progress through the book because I spent a long time trying to understand code-breaking and how it worked. Once I put aside trying to fully comprehend the codebreaking process, I was able to better enjoy the book, its characters and the history. I really enjoyed how Kate Quinn weaved many real people into the novel with her fictional characters. I think this book will stick with me for a long time.\n\n""]"

Horrible enough that my little sister won't even speak to me.But when I'm released back into a town determined to rub my unknown sins in my face, the past isn't the only thing that's haunting me. The four ""imaginary"" friends who made my childhood bearable barge into my life in a very real way.They're crude, criminally inclined, and more than a little unstable after ages trapped in afterlife limbo. All they want is to protect me. Worship me. Avenge me.So they'll bludgeon, maim, eviscerate—tear a strip of havoc right through this sleepy town.Even rise from the dead.Maybe I'm still not all that sane either, because part of me finds them strangely appealing. In ways very different from how I felt as a kid. And that's not the only strangeness stirring inside me...I promised myself I'd stick to the straight and narrow from here on. But what if the only way to set things right is to get a little ghoulish?*The Stalking Dead is the first in a darkly humorous new paranormal romance series by bestselling author Eva Chase.

There’s the big mystery of why Lily was sent to an institution for years without remembering the event that caused her incarceration, who the big evil company is and what their motivations are, what happened to the guys and a few other mysteries I don’t want to give away. I’m sure they are all connected somehow but we don’t know quite yet. It was a good introduction to the mysteries and the series.I like that all of the men were distinguishable. It did get confusing at times going between the possessed bodies and the ghosts but once you caught on it was easy. They were a bit of your typical guys within these type of books but they were well written.This is a pretty slow burn romance. There is a bit of steam but the romance is more on the back burner in this book.

  The updated edition of the bestselling book that has changed millions of lives with its insights into the growth mindset“Through clever research studies and engaging writing, Dweck illuminates how our beliefs about our capabilities exert tremendous influence on how we learn and which paths we take in life.”—Bill Gates, GatesNotes After decades of research, world-renowned Stanford University psychologist Carol S. Dweck, Ph.D., discovered a simple but groundbreaking idea: the power of mindset. In this brilliant book, she shows how success in school, work, sports, the arts, and almost every area of human endeavor can be dramatically influenced by how we think about our talents and abilities. People with a fixed mindset—those who believe that abilities are fixed—are less likely to flourish than those with a growth mindset—those who believe that abilities can be developed. Mindset reveals how great parents, teachers, managers, and athletes can put this idea to use to foster outstanding accomplishment. In this edition, Dweck offers new insights into her now famous and broadly embraced concept. She introduces a phenomenon she calls false growth mindset and guides people toward adopting a deeper, truer growth mindset. She also expands the mindset concept beyond the individual, applying it to the cultures of groups and organizations. With the right mindset, you can motivate those you lead, teach, and love—to transform their lives and your own.

Does a wonderful job of explaining growth vs fixed mindsets as well as giving lots of practical examples.  Best strategy we have found is to have faculty read and come prepared to share around one chapter at our monthly faculty meeting.  This has worked really well in terms of people sharing and actually applying learning in their classrooms and in their lives.  Unforeseen byproduct is that it has also given teams a way to openly talk about, address, and gently challenge each other when fixed mindset thinking creeps in.  Very helpful if you have a team that sees constant improvement as a challenge or as a destination (instead of an ongoing journey).  Strongly recommend.\n\n']"

It turns out that just six deliberate habits give you the edge.

It summarizes much of the material presented in his live seminars that draw 2,000+ people several times a year, and updates much of the research. What sets Brendon apart from other personal development gurus is the thoroughness of his research and the practicality of his action items. You aren\'t asked to speak to your inner child or manifest grace into your life; the items are as tactical as programming your phone or adding supplements to your wellness regime. But these tactics are all part of an overall strategy to help you achieve your goals in multiple arenas. But be forewarned - there is a LOT of useful information here. It\'s easy to get overloaded.

And Alessio is this ruthless man whose soft side takes you off guard. The chemistry between the two is so real. And every time Alessio defends Natalia is so intense. Even the sexual chemistry between them is off the charts and hot to read.There is OM and OW drama, but the way everything comes together is *chefs kiss*\n\n']"

  My new boss likes rules, but there's one nobody dares to break...No touching his banana. Seriously. The guy is like a potassium addict. Of course, I touched it. If you want to get technical, I actually put it in my mouth. I chewed it up, too... I even swallowed.I know. Bad, bad, girl.Then I saw him, and believe it or not, choking on a guy's banana does not make the best first impression. I should backtrack a little here. Before I ever touched a billionaire’s banana, I got my first real assignment as a business reporter. This wasn’t the same old bottom-of-the-barrel assignment I always got. I wasn’t going to interview a garbage man about his favorite routes or write a piece on how picking up dog poop from people’s yards is the next big thing. Nope. None of the above, thank you very much.This was my big break. My chance to prove I wasn’t a bumbling, clumsy, accident-prone walking disaster. I was infiltrating Galleon Enterprises to follow up on suspicions of corruption. Cue the James Bond music.I could do this. All I had to do was land the position as an intern and nail my interview with Bruce Chamberson.Forget the fact that he looked like somebody carved him out of liquid female desire, then sprinkled on some ""makes men question their sexuality"" for good measure. I needed to make this work. No accidents. No disasters. No clumsiness. All I needed to do was hold it together for less than an hour.Fast forward to the conference room before the interview, and that's where you would find me with a banana in my hand. A banana that literally had his name on it in big, black sharpie. It was a few seconds later when he walked in and caught me yellow-handed. A few seconds after that was when he hired me. Yeah. I know. It didn't seem like a good sign to me, either.

No one decides how bright you shine but you.» Remi's momWith The High Mountain Court, A.K. Mulford sets up a beautiful world in which a diverse cast will evolve. In this YA fantasy, she introduces us to Okrith and it’s five courts (High Mountain, Western, Southern, Northern and Eastern). Each court has their own witches (red, brown, blue, green and purple).I really like that the author uses the trip of Remi to explain to us the different culture and the different powers that each coven of witches has. There is a lot of world building and description but because it is separated between each place, it’s a little bit less overbuilding.I also like the fact that each court is really different. Nothing is left behind by A.K. Mulford, their skin color is different, their clothes and their ways of living also.I just think there was a little bit too much description in some parts of the story.The plot is well written and you discover the plot at the same time as Remi. There is just enough suspense to give you the feeling of wanting more. I figured out some parts of the plot before it happened, but I was still surprised by the end of it. For me, it’s always a good thing.Like in some of other fantasy, there were some obstacles that seemed unconquerable, but the characters got over them easily. For me, it’s always frustrating and seems rushed by the author.Finally, A.K. Mulford introduces us to such a good and diverse cast of characters. For me, it’s the best part of the book. Remi has just enough sass and she has a strong personality. When she sets her head around something, no one will be able to change her mind. She is relatable and believable.Hale is a strong fae warrior with a big heart and I like the fact that he doesn’t need to feel superior. He wants everyone to be equal.I think my favorites are «The eagles», two of the fae warriors under Hale commandement. They are full of dry humor.I like that we have different LGBTQ representants and no one is afraid of who they are and who they like. She choose to represent homosexuel and non-binary characters. It was refreshing and well explained. She also makes sure to use the right pronoun for everyone.The relationships are upfront and enjoyable. They are reliable through the ups and downs and you really feel the affection between them.I’m a sucker for chosen family or family by heart. A.K. Mulford prouves us that it’s ok to be broken and it’s ok to choose your family from your heart instead of your blood relatives.«Help lead this worl into a better future, Remi.  Be brave and kind and strong and clever, as you've always been.»Heather\n\n"", '\n\n  A.K. Mulford did such a good job of building her world in this book.

We have Fae, Witches, magic, adventure, an impossible mission, lovers fighting to overcome all odds, evil kings, and destiny.It was just the right amount of world building, enough for the story to make sense, and not overwhelming where you are skimming pages. It is such an asset for high fantasy because it keeps the plot moving and the pace up.The characters are well written, racially diverse, and there is great LBGTQIA+ representation.The love in this book hits on every side, Mulford shows family love, unrequited,  long lost, Fated... she hits it all.It was a bit of a slow start but still enjoyable.

I knew this finale would shatter my heart, I just didn't expect it to do so as throughly or as wickedly as this one did. This one is rough on the emotions for much of the book, so if you're looking for sunshine and happiness, this is the wrong series for you.That said, it's glorious. The book does not hold back in its heartbreaking ruthlessness, nor does it restrict on the action and majesty brought to its two main characters. Rielle in particular walks a truly dark path and I cringed at some of her actions. She is one of the most complex anti-heroes in the YA fantasy genre.As for Eliana, I adore her. Strong, powerful, determined, and inspiring, I rooted for her every chance I had. Even with all she'd been through, I could hardly believe at the power of her. Not just her magical abilities, but her character and drive.Of all the side characters, I felt Audric developed the most. He is just so good and sweet and brave and I ached for him every single time. Corien also became interesting and one of the most diabolical villains in the genre. I would have liked a lot more time with Simon since I have some serious questions for him and he left me quite conflicted!The action is top notch and ruthless. The story and arcs are amazing, though the first half of the book dragged out a bit for poor Eliana, who endured so much. I loved seeing more of the world and the creatures and the darkness that made it so compelling.This entire series is absolutely fantastic and I highly recommend one for anyone who wants a series packed with emotion, complex anti-heroes, and intense magic. It will leave you exhausted and fulfilled at the same time. I loved it!\n\n""]"

I also wanted a little more anger from Flynn towards the Duke for being the instigator of 'his best friend', Flynn's Father's death.I like how Collette included other characters from previous books and a little play-by-play to tempt us towards the coming novels. I kept flipping back and forth to my books TBR to check as to where they fit and if I had read their stories yet.  That was my only hic-up. I kind of wish she hadn't included as much info in the epilogue as I think a pairing (or two) are mentioned that haven't been written yet and will be a future 'Romancing a Scot Series' book.I truly enjoyed this book and eagerly await the next in the series.

It is just the sweetest story that still requires some suspension of disbelief because the MCs have to fall in love in less than a week. But I've always believed that if an author can execute a romance well enough, then it shouldn't matter how many days it takes. And Walker definitely executes it well.The story follows Cass and Jayden. Cass moved back to his hometown of Hartbrigde after his divorce and started working in a B&B. And three years later, he's about to welcome his first guests. Jayden is his chef for the holidays. Jayden is an Aussie ex-pat who moves around a lot. But recently, he's become disenchanted with the life of a wanderer and wants to find a home. Of course, he doesn't expect that home to be in Hartbridge.The story is set in the few days leading up to Christmas. Cass and Jayden click almost immediately, in that they like to talk to each other and spend time together. Jayden is in awe of how sweet, humble, and hardworking Cass is. And Cass loves Jayden's generosity and free spirit.Saying that Cass and Jayden are adorable together would be an understatement. The two of them are so cute, and I couldn't stop smiling the whole book. The story is entirely free of angst, yet there's not a dull moment as the protagonists spend their days working, talking and flirting (lots of flirting). They spend a lot of quality time getting to know each other. And that, plus the lightheartedness of the book, was what really sold the romance for me.I liked the first book in the series too, but it felt like there wasn't enough, or that something was missing. Nothing was missing here. I loved Cass and Jayden together, I loved the setting, and I loved the warmth of the tone. This was a very sweet story, and I highly recommend it.\n\n"", '\n\n  <b> Contains: employee-boss, many emotional first times with a man, tender gestures, filled with love, chef and B&B owner. </b>The book is completely <b> the sweetest fluffy story ever. </b> We find ourselves back in this charming country village straight out of a Christmas movie.We find Cass, freshly separated from his wife and trying to set up a B&B.

Do yourself a favour and put this on your to-read Christmas Wish List.\n\n', '\n\n  Enjoyed this one even more than Tic Tac Mistletoe. Another awesome holiday romance from a talented author. Perfect for Christmas!\n\n', ""\n\n  YES! I was so excited when I saw this novel had been released. After reading Tic-Tac-Mistletoe (Book 1) in January 2021, I was waiting patiently... okay, not so patiently - for Book 2, and it did not disappoint!Cass and Jayden are instantly such loveable characters, both bringing their own strengths to the novel that it was hard to put it down. Their determination and support for one another was lovely to read - as was how welcoming the town was to Jayden. Even more so was the way the author introduced us to Cass' ex-wife and two children, and instead of their being drama and hatred between the two exes, showing us the spport and love that they still had for one another despite the divorce.The only problem is that I have read this book at the end of November, and now Christmas can't come soon enough. If only I had a large mansion, open fireplaces and a copious amount of hot chocolate (and some gingerbread cake...) to spend my days in while we await the visit from the big guy in the red suit.Already counting down the days until Christmas 2022, when we will hopefully get another visit in with the Hartbridge lot!\n\n"", '\n\n  CHRISTMAS WISH LIST follows Jayden Turner as he takes a short-term position as the chef for a bed and breakfast that’s opening for the holidays. There’s instant attraction between him and his new boss, Carter (Cass) Campion. Cass recently came out to his family and friends, but he hasn’t really had the time to explore his sexuality.-This was a sweet holiday romance! It’s a light, low angst read, perfect for this busy month. It does also has some sexy moments. Think small-town Hallmark holiday romance, but with a little bit of spice.I really enjoyed seeing Cass with his family (his parents, his ex wife, their kids) and how they all welcomed Jayden. I liked Ren and Hamish and the little bit of tension between Cass and Hamish was interesting.I would have liked this story to be more fleshed out and have it go deeper, but I’m still satisfied with this light read.-I didn’t realize this was a sequel to a book I bought recently until I started reading it. I haven’t read book 1 (TIC-TAC-MISTLETOE) yet but this book made me even more excited to pick it up.-3.5 stars, CHRISTMAS WISH LIST by N. R. Walker is available now!-Thank you to Blueheart Press and Netgalley for sending me an eARC to review.\n\n']"

Yet he is no ordinary killer: his targets are the multifarious monsters and vile fiends that ravage the land and attack the innocent. Sword of Destiny is the follow up to The Last Wish, and together they are the perfect introduction to a one of a kind fantasy world.Witcher collectionsThe Last WishSword of DestinyWitcher novelsBlood of ElvesThe Time of ContemptBaptism of Fire The Tower of SwallowsLady of the LakeSeason of StormsHussite TrilogyThe Tower of FoolsWarriors of GodTranslated from original Polish by David French   Read more  ","['4.0 out of 5 stars', '5.0 out of 5 stars', '5.0 out of 5 stars', '2.0 out of 5 stars', '5.0 out of 5 stars', '5.0 out of 5 stars', '4.0 out of 5 stars', '4.0 out of 5 stars']","['\nGreat but not perfect\n', '\nGreat read!

  Soon to be a major television event from Pascal Pictures, starring Tom Holland.Based on the true story of a forgotten hero, the USA Today and #1 Amazon Charts bestseller Beneath a Scarlet Sky is the triumphant, epic tale of one young man’s incredible courage and resilience during one of history’s darkest hours.Pino Lella wants nothing to do with the war or the Nazis. He’s a normal Italian teenager—obsessed with music, food, and girls—but his days of innocence are numbered. When his family home in Milan is destroyed by Allied bombs, Pino joins an underground railroad helping Jews escape over the Alps, and falls for Anna, a beautiful widow six years his senior.In an attempt to protect him, Pino’s parents force him to enlist as a German soldier—a move they think will keep him out of combat. But after Pino is injured, he is recruited at the tender age of eighteen to become the personal driver for Adolf Hitler’s left hand in Italy, General Hans Leyers, one of the Third Reich’s most mysterious and powerful commanders.Now, with the opportunity to spy for the Allies inside the German High Command, Pino endures the horrors of the war and the Nazi occupation by fighting in secret, his courage bolstered by his love for Anna and for the life he dreams they will one day share.Fans of All the Light We Cannot See, The Nightingale, and Unbroken will enjoy this riveting saga of history, suspense, and love.

The hero of the tale is Pino Lella, and Italian boy, only seventeen years old when he is enlisted by a catholic priest to aid him in leading Jews and downed airmen over the Italian Alp to Switzerland.  After some harrowing experiences doing just that, Pino leaves the area and returns to Milan.  His parents insist that he joins the German occupiers army so that he will not be conscripted and end up on the Russian Front..  Nearly immediately he is enlisted to become the driver for the highest ranking Nazi in Italy.  As soon as this is made known to the Italian resistance, they call upon him to spy as he now has access to the German war machines plans for Italy.And just around the same time, he meets and falls in love with a girl.  She is working as a maid for the mistress of his boss,  General Hans Leyers.  The love story of these two is an important part of the tale.The atrocities he viewed, the death and destructtion he lived with on a daily basis, would have been too much for most to bear, but somehow,  this young man, only eighteen years old performed the duties he felt he owed to his country and country men with bravery above and beyond what is normal.These secrets and many others he kept all his life.  After the war he moved to the U.S.A. and lived a decent life but kept mum about his wartime experiences until Mark Sullivan, the author, was able to convince him to tell his story.  I, for one, am glad he did.  Historically, this gave me a much better picture of Italy during the war and the brave men and woman who risked their lives to go up against the Germans who occupied their territory as they had their original enemies, like Poland, France and the Netherlands.\n\n', '\n\n  This is, hands down, one of the very best WW2 books I\'ve ever read.  I was constantly shaking my head in amazement at the things Pino went through, his attitude all through the war, his never-ending readiness and desire to ""do the right thing.""  Mark Sullivan did an excellent job in writing this book, he made Pino so real to me that I feel as if I\'ve sat at the table and visited with him.  Beautiful, beautiful job.  Thank you to Pino for all he did and thank you to Mark Sullivan for telling his incredible story.\n\n', ""\n\n  Beneath a Scarlet Sky is so smoothly written that it feels like I'm watching a poignant documentary on TV. The characters are true to life and I feel what they feel as if I were there. But, it's Italy, WW2. Not a good time to be in Italy. We live through the war with the lead character, a teenager turning rapidly into a man. As he balances being drafted against becoming a member of the resistance and likely a short life...well. either way it could be very short...another option presents itself. He can wear a Nazi uniform and drive for the #2 Nazi commander, essentially becoming a spy for the Allies. As a driver he becomes deeply aware of troubling decisions which he reports back. Compensation for his danger comes in meeting a beautiful girl whom he falls in love with. Together they hope to see things through safely to the end of the war. But Fate is not kind. The Nazis do not retreat from Italy as the war bends in favor of Allied troops. The people of Italy suffer dreadfully as the Nazis hang on...Until they rise up and attack the Nazi overlords in support of the Allied invasion. Lives are lost. It is the price of freedom, a price that leaves deep scars even for courageous heroes. You will feel their losses and rejoice in their victories.\n\n"", '\n\n  At the outset of World War II, Pino Lella is a normal Italian teenager. But, when the Nazis invade Italy, he is sent to a monastery in the Alps, where he is embroiled in plan to sneak Jews across the Swiss border to safety. On reaching his 18th birthday, his parents force him to enlist with the Nazis in order to ride out the war unharmed. Unable to stomach collaboration, Pino becomes a spy for the resistance.What I liked about this book was the insight into an aspect of the war I had never learned of before. Book stores are full of war stories from England, France and the Netherlands. There are even a fair few holocaust stories set within Germany or Poland. Yet, this is the first time I\'ve read anything about Italy, one of the axis powers, during World War II. Until reading this book, I did not know, because I had never thought of it, that many Italians resisted not only the Nazis, but Mussolini as well. I also did not know that priests, bishops and other church officials were actively engaged in smuggling Jews to safety.As for the rest, I wasn\'t terribly impressed. The writing leans far too heavily on tell on not nearly enough on show. This does switch somewhat towards the end, but it made getting to the end a struggle. The characters were two-dimensional. I just couldn\'t find a way to relate to them.Throughout the narrative, I kept wondering if perhaps the author relied too much on the word of Pino Lella himself. In the story, Pino is so constantly heroic, so consistently exceeds any expectation of a boy his age (expert mountaineer, fluent in three languages, expert race car driver, gifted piano player without seeming to ever practice) that it comes across as bordering on propaganda.If you are fascinated by war stories, you may enjoy ""Beneath a Scarlet Sky,"" but it\'s probably more well suited to young adults.\n\n', ""\n\n  I never read war novels. I don't like how the violence and emotion inherent in war play with my senses and seem to scar my imagination, and my zest for life. I am, however, an avid reader and especially appreciate novels that are based on true stories. Beneath A Scarlet Sky took that which I detest and that which I love and weaved it so poignantly and beautifully together in a single masterpiece that I could not stop reading until the end was known and the questions were answered. So engrossed was I its content and backstory, that I relished even the acknowledgements as they lent substance and credibility to this work of art. Highly recommend.\n\n""]"

Once their desires are out in the open, they realize they have the perfect set-up. He doesn’t want love, she doesn’t have time for love, so that just leaves the sex. Their arrangement could be surprisingly seamless, as long as Tate can stick to the only two rules Miles has for her.Never ask about the past. Don’t expect a future.They think they can handle it, but realize almost immediately they can’t handle it at all.Hearts get infiltrated. Promises get broken. Rules get shattered.Love gets ugly.

Now, I need to take a solid break from reading (as i always do after finishing colleens books).\n\n"", ""\n\n  Colleen Hoover has done it again. Not that I ever doubted her, but I didn’t know what to expect when starting Ugly Love. It’s safe to say she never disappoints. With her amazing writing style, fascinating characters and original story lines, I was hooked from the beginning. I expected to love this book. What I wasn’t expecting was for my heart to be shredded.Ugly.\u2028Love.\u2028Destroyed.Me.\u2028This book pulled at my heartstrings. I felt so much heartache while reading. There were some lighter moments, but the majority felt heavy and emotional.When Tate decides to move in with her brother for a while, she never expects to meet a man like Miles. Miles is a pilot like her brother. Miles is taciturn. He seems flat. But there is something about him that intrigues Tate.I have no idea what’s going through his head. He never smiles. He never laughs. He doesn’t flirt. His face appears as if he keeps a constant veil of armor between his expressions and the rest of the world.\u2028Miles and Tate develop a friendship, kind of. It’s difficult to be friends with someone who is closed off like Miles is. You can just feel the sadness radiating off of him. Then it happens. Tate feels like she is starting to make progress with this man.Miles really likes Tate. But the last thing he is looking for is love. Their attraction and chemistry is too strong to deny, so they go with the whole ‘friends with benefits’ thing. As long as Tate can follow Mile’s two rules, they can be together in that way.“Don’t ask about my past,” he says firmly.  “And never expect a future.”\u2028Tate is so enamored with Miles, she’ll take him any way she can get him. She’s never felt this strongly about a man. She feels so much when she’s with him, she can’t get enough.Miles is the way he is for a good reason. The book is in dual pov, going back and forth between Tate’s perspective in the present, and Miles perspective in the past. You get to see as time goes on, why Miles has these rules and why he is protecting his heart this way. When you get hurt in such an ugly way, you want nothing to do with love. No matter how beautiful it can be. But that doesn’t stop Tate from developing feelings for him. Even though she knows they can never be reciprocated.Miles is a character that broke my heart. At first you see his past and the type of guy he was… then you see him so standoffish in the present. It makes you wonder what could have happened to make him that way. I had my theories (all of which were wrong) but once I found out- I wish I would have been right. It was something unimaginable and you can see why he wouldn’t be able to move on from that.I loved the chemistry and the slow build between them. Even though the feelings were fought most of the book, you could still feel them brewing just below the surface.I think every book I’ve read by this author has made me cry. Even if it’s just a few tears, I always cry. This book. I did more than just cry a few tears. Oh the tears. There were times I couldn’t control the tears. They just streamed down my face continually while I read through them. It was heart wrenching and so emotional. Ugly Love made me Ugly Cry. Big time. Some parts were worse than others, but wow. I just FELT so much while reading this.I am a huge Colleen Hoover fan and I’ve read every one of her books. This one has a little something different than the others. Most of her books make me feel strongly and contain a lot of emotional moments, and Ugly Love had that for sure... but it also had much more steam than the others. And yes- CoHo can write some sexy scenes!It’s been a while since I’ve read a paperback book, but when I heard this was out early at several bookstores, I ran to my local store and picked up a copy along with a mini light so I could read in bed. And I did. I stayed up way past my bedtime reading this book. I went into work the next day sleepy and raw from crying, but let me tell you- it was worth it! Although Hopeless still takes the top spot of my favorite book by this author, this will be a close second!Colleen Hoover is one of those people who is doing what she was born to do- she's sharing her amazing stories with us. Her writing style is unique and incredible. Ugly Love is captivating, beautiful, emotional, and devastatingly painful to read but I’ll let you in on a little secret. The ending makes every ounce of pain I felt worth it. An unforgettable story I highly recommend!\n\n"", '\n\n  I loved this book so much finish it in one night.. I was so satisfied w the ending.. i laughed and cried so much.. even though this book is only three hundred pgs it feels like so much more. I’ve only ever read one book besides this one that was written by Colleen and I can feel she is is an amazing writer.. I recommend this to anybody who like romance but w a catch.\n\n', ""\n\n  I was a Colleen Hoover virgin before I read this book. I'm not sure what took me so long but when the amazing author Belle Brooks told me I needed to read it, I listened.I’m now hooked.Ugly Love took me on an emotional journey and I enjoyed every minute of it.It was beautifully written.So much so, that about halfway way through, my instinct was to trash every story I've ever written because they'll never be as good as this one.I managed to refrain... for now.Guess who’s going to one-click every book with Colleen Hoover’s name on it?Me.\n\n""]"

The hot molten looks he gives Sloane, the small swirl of steam that gives over to that rush of everything that sets your inside on fire and ends up with that satisfying smile afterwards. These two are so connected it’s like it has been ordained by the gods.These two go from an OMG she’s crazy to dear god I am obsessed relationship. She makes him smile, she makes him hot, she makes him want to forget about who he really is and he hopes she never finds out. For Sloane it’s the fact that Declan is like no other man she has known and she isn’t sure how to handle him but she will learn.As I got closer to the end I thought, I can’t be almost done I need more of these two. Their story moved quickly, it changed; it made you give second thought to some of the characters. You don’t ever realize you are flipping those pages; there were no one more chapters, and for now it is done!So we wait, we wait to find out how this all ends and I can honestly say that ending, I did not see that coming! Do you hear that tap, tap, tap?  That’s me waiting for Savage Hearts to drop!\n\n', ""\n\n  I didn't think I could love any other book in this series more so than Nat and Kages, I was wrong. Sloane and Declan are everything! Sloane is actually one of the best written characters I've read in a long time. She never stops talking. She's hilarious. She brings men to their knees within minutes of talking to them. Absolutely love her. When I grow up...I want to be like Sloane.This book is so good. Sloane getting kidnapped by the Irish mafia. This story gives us a little captive romance. The bdsm theme translates into this book as well. Love the smut. It was so great to see a character like Sloane be dominated. The woman eats men for breakfast.I love how each of the books in the series are connected. The author knows just how to end the story and leave us with a cliffhanger.

Meeting Sloane in Ruthless Creatures had me so excited for this book and I was not disappointed. The very first chapter alone had me laughing out loud. Sloane is hilarious. She’s also tough as nails, nothing fazes her. Not many people would take being kidnapped in stride, and that only annoys Declan. But he sees through her sass. He is total bad a** swoon. And they light this book on fire. Not everything was for me, but this was a page turner for me I couldn’t put down. Complete with some emotion, action, suspense and twists I didn’t see coming.

We loved Sloane in Ruthless Creatures. The witty best friend who has quips, is badass and seems to have every man she meets under her spell.  Kidnapped by Declan O'Donnell it quickly becomes apparent that she's met her match! They hate each other. He is the Irish mob, she is the best friend to Nathalie who is attached to the Russian boss Kasimir (Kage). The story is funny, fast-paced, suspenseful, steamy with BDSM elements. It's a story I won't forget!\n\n"", '\n\n  This book is huge!! Huge in vocabulary and characters! Declan and Sloane…the former is the newly appointed Irish mob leader and the latter is the best friend of the Bratva leader’s fiancée. Declan kidnapped Sloane for she was the cause of death of some Irish Mob. It took awhile for Declan and Sloane to find a common ground but their bantering is hilarious. There never was a dull moment in this book… romance, passion, bondage (Yes 🔥🔥), comedy, action. You name it this book has it !Kudos to JT for another amazing book. This book is highly recommended to read and reread 😃. I don’t do that very often but I’ll make this an exception. TBR on my list again🤩\n\n', '\n\n  Sloane and Declan are made for each other! I read this book in a day because I was so caught up in the twists and turns then trying to keep up with the push and pull between Sloane and Declan.

Cannot wait for the next Queens & Monsters book!\n\n', '\n\n  Second instalment following Sloane and Declan. I didn’t realize there would be a cliffhanger and would’ve abstained until the next book in the series was out to read this one, because this is such an entertaining story. I NEED MORE NOW!

  Instant #1 New York Times BestsellerAARP The Magazine – Recommended Summer ReadingCNN – A Most Anticipated Book of AugustBustle – A Most Anticipated Book of AugustChief Inspector Armand Gamache returns to Three Pines in #1 New York Times bestseller Louise Penny's latest spellbinding novelYou’re a coward.Time and again, as the New Year approaches, that charge is leveled against Armand Gamache. It starts innocently enough. While the residents of the Québec village of Three Pines take advantage of the deep snow to ski and toboggan, to drink hot chocolate in the bistro and share meals together, the Chief Inspector finds his holiday with his family interrupted by a simple request. He’s asked to provide security for what promises to be a non-event.  A visiting Professor of Statistics will be giving a lecture at the nearby university. While he is perplexed as to why the head of homicide for the Sûreté du Québec would be assigned this task, it sounds easy enough.  That is until Gamache starts looking into Professor Abigail Robinson and discovers an agenda so repulsive he begs the university to cancel the lecture.They refuse, citing academic freedom, and accuse Gamache of censorship and intellectual cowardice.  Before long, Professor Robinson’s views start seeping into conversations.  Spreading and infecting.  So that truth and fact, reality and delusion are so confused it’s near impossible to tell them apart.Discussions become debates, debates become arguments, which turn into fights.  As sides are declared, a madness takes hold.    Abigail Robinson promises that, if they follow her, ça va bien aller.  All will be well.  But not, Gamache and his team know, for everyone.When a murder is committed it falls to Armand Gamache, his second-in-command Jean-Guy Beauvoir, and their team to investigate the crime as well as this extraordinary popular delusion. And the madness of crowds.

That perhaps Covid 19 has culled the flock and good riddance to them.  At least this is the philosophy of Professor Abigail Robinson who is giving a speech to her followers in a venue where Chief Inspector Armand Gamache is required to provide the security.  In what one might call ""A Rally"", this woman explains her belief in euthanizing the elderly when they reach a certain age and children not born perfect.  And after that are we supposed to care when someone takes a pot shot at her?Anyway, she is not the murder victim,  you must wait until the middle of the book to find out who is.  Then it will be left to Armand Gamache, his son-in-law Jean Guy, and his loyal assistant, Isabelle Lacoste to solve the crime.  By the way, when did Jean Guy come back from France and start working for Gamache again?If I have a criticism about the book, it would be that I would have like to see and  hear more from the usual villagers, like Ruth, Myrna, and the owners of the Bistro whom we readers have come to think of as our own family of friends.  The entire Gamache family is staying with Reine Marie and Armand, but it is never explained why they are all back from Paris.  I felt like I missed some continuity somehow.And the way, Gamache solved this murder, jumping from one ""Ah Ha"" moment to the next as he discovered one piece of evidence, and then another and another,  was contrived and gave me whiplash changing from one suspect to another, like a bad Hercule Poirot imitation.  A rather strange investigation for such a brilliant detective.I still have a soft spot for all the usual characters in the book and Louise Penny and her written creations.\n\n', ""\n\n  4.5 stars Whenever a new book by Louise Penny is published, it immediately goes to the top of my reading list. Set in the idyllic, charming village of Three Pines, Quebec, Penny has designed a place where I want to live. I want to get to know the people in this community and to eat in the Bistro. Her characters are so well developed that they seem real, and with each book, we get to know them better; their kindness, their foibles and quirks, their place in the village, and their relationships with neighbors and friends. In many ways, this is the best and most powerful book in the series. It is deep, dark, and provocative.There are moral dilemmas and ethical discussions and much food for thought. There is a murder, of course, amongst the sparkling winter landscape, hot chocolate, and outdoor activities with the children playing in the snow.  After a long time following COVID restrictions, the villagers have come out of isolation, delighted that the vaccine has ended the pandemic. They are now free to congregate, hug, discard masks, and resume a normal life, but the pandemic has left them with grief and lingering sadness. This post-COVID setting is a little too soon while we are still in the midst of the 4th wave in most places, even when fully vaccinated. I felt the plot became convoluted when possible motives, opportunities, and suspects were discussed and with the added inclusion of a killing long in the past. These theories seemed to be contemplated repeatedly to the point of tedium but gave the reader a puzzle to ponder. Chief Inspector Armand Gamache is back. He is Head of Homicide for the Surete de Quebec. Team members Isabelle and Jean-Guy, his son-in-law, are also involved in the investigations. The Gamache family now has several grandchildren. Fellow villagers, like the artist Claire, Myrna, who runs a bookstore, Gabe and Olivier, managers of the Bistro (shut down during the pandemic), are now busy and open for business. It was great to be reacquainted with the elderly, foul-mouthed, eccentric poet Ruth with her pet duck. She is much more insightful than people believe. There are three visitors to Three Pines. Do they have hidden agendas?  Why are they there in the dead of winter? Gamache has been requested to provide security at a lecture for a visiting statistician, Abigal Robinson. He feels that there will be little attendance in a small nearby University in the dead of winter and that statistics are not a stimulating subject. However, he learns that she holds abhorrent conclusions and that many are traveling in to hear her speech. She is personally charming, but her views are dangerous and morally repellent. Gamache tries to have the lecture canceled but is unsuccessful. Gamache is haunted by a scene he witnessed in a nursing home where the elderly were neglected and left to die.  Based on her research to be presented to the Quebec Premier on how COVID had dire effects on health care and the economy, Abigal is advocating forced euthanasia on the elderly and disabled. Shots are fired at the lecture, and chaos results. Abigal is visiting with her friend and assistant. The other newcomer is Haniya Daoud, a young Nobel Peace Prize nominee from Sudan. She has experienced the most horrible, nightmarish torture before her escape to freedom. Living in an isolated cabin in the woods is a professor who, as a young doctor, participated in some factual and dreadful mind-altering experiments at McGill University on behalf of the CIA. He knew what was happening but kept quiet about it. These left many of the subjects damaged for life. He keeps this part of his life secret but is unpopular as he did nothing to help the community during the COVID lockdown. On New Year's eve, there is a murder in a nearby wooded area while most villagers enjoyed a party. An intelligent and empathetic Gamache and his team must question the possible suspects and figure out the killer's motive.  This turns out to be a very complex and difficult investigation and asks if a murder can be motivated by love as well as hate. Can there ever be a justification for killing?  This was an enthralling, thought-provoking novel involving the reader's emotions with some tear-jerking moments and surprising twists and revelations, tension and suspense, a difficult puzzle, and captivating characters.\n\n"", '\n\n  Let me start by saying I LOVE Louise Penny and all the characters in Three Pines.  I did NOT, however, love this latest installment entitled ""The Madness of Crowds.""In the acknowledgments, Penny talks about how she initially wanted to avoid discussing the pandemic in the book, thinking people would not want to read about the coronavirus when they were dealing with it day by day in the real world.  She says she changed her mind halfway through the first draft, deciding to set the book after the pandemic was over.  Personally, I wanted to revisit Three Pines as one of the few things untouched by this global crisis. In addition, the virus in the book ended after the second wave, while our reality is currently dealing with the fourth wave.  I therefore read the book feeling a bit depressed and off kilter.Usually, I read each Penny book very quickly, caught up in the plot and characters.  I kept putting this book down. I felt the plot went in circles at times, although, considering the title, maybe that was the intent.  There were also 2 or 3 times that a character said something only to have it repeated a page or two later: I feel this is more of an editing issue but it bothered me.Sadly, I feel disappointed by ""The Madness of Crowds"" but look forward to my next visit to Three Pines.\n\n']"

The book is nice to look at and the story is great, the the font size and spacing make this book really difficult to read. Oddly, the first 3 books in the series were great in this regard, but this one and Goblet of Fire are too hard to read. Might end up going digital for the rest of the series with my Kobo. Too bad, as the experience of sitting down with my daughter and reading these from her growing ""collection"" was really fun for both of us. I\'m sure we\'ll enjoy the digital versions just fine, but a physical book was a better fit for this.\n\n', ""\n\n  Love the Bloomsbury Press editions. They're soft to the touch and very comfortable to read.\n\n"", '\n\n  I ordered Used Good condition book. But I can say that the condition was as good as new.Rest nothing to say, as a Harry Potter fan, I love the book naturally.\n\n', '\n\n  Love this book, I bought this one because my old copy fell apart from everyone in the family reading it too many times.\n\n', '\n\n  We have paper copies....my wife wanted to read along on her kindle. All in the family love these books.\n\n', '\n\n  I made a deal with my 10 year old daughter. I would order this book if she finsihed reading the first 4. I also said I would read them as well to see what all the excitement was about. I read the first 4 books very quickly and loved them. We ended up reading the Phoenix together, with 2 different bookmarks!! I couldn\'t put it down!! I finished first! I am very impressed at the way this book was written - my 10 year old loves it and it held my interest very well as well which says quite a bit for an author who writes ""kids"" books! This series is amazing. I cannot wait for the next book. The prophecy at the end of the book sets up the next book and any book after really - a fight between good and evil. A lot is explained in this book. I would read it again and probably will while waiting for the next book. Hopefully we won\'t have to wait to long!!\n\n', '\n\n  Great book series, currently rereading it aloud to my six year old daughter.\n\n']"

  The internationally acclaimed, New York Times bestselling author returns to the magnificent universe he constructed in his bestselling novels The Shadow of the Wind, The Angel’s Game, and The Prisoner of Heaven in this riveting series finale—a heart-pounding thriller and nail-biting work of suspense which introduces a sexy, seductive new heroine whose investigation shines a light on the dark history of Franco’s Spain.In this unforgettable final volume of Ruiz Zafón’s cycle of novels set in the universe of the Cemetery of Forgotten Books, beautiful and enigmatic Alicia Gris, with the help of the Sempere family, uncovers one of the most shocking conspiracies in all Spanish history.Nine-year-old Alicia lost her parents during the Spanish Civil War when the Nacionales (the fascists) savagely bombed Barcelona in 1938. Twenty years later, she still carries the emotional and physical scars of that violent and terrifying time. Weary of her work as an investigator for Spain’s secret police in Madrid, a job she has held for more than a decade, the twenty-nine-year old plans to move on. At the insistence of her boss, Leandro Montalvo, she remains to solve one last case: the mysterious disappearance of Spain’s Minister of Culture, Mauricio Valls.With her partner, the intimidating policeman Juan Manuel Vargas, Alicia discovers a possible clue—a rare book by the author Victor Mataix hidden in Valls’ office in his Madrid mansion. Valls was the director of the notorious Montjuic Prison in Barcelona during World War II where several writers were imprisoned, including David Martín and Victor Mataix. Traveling to Barcelona on the trail of these writers, Alicia and Vargas meet with several booksellers, including Juan Sempere, who knew her parents.As Alicia and Vargas come closer to finding Valls, they uncover a tangled web of kidnappings and murders tied to the Franco regime, whose corruption is more widespread and horrifying than anyone imagined. Alicia’s courageous and uncompromising search for the truth puts her life in peril. Only with the help of a circle of devoted friends will she emerge from the dark labyrinths of Barcelona and its history into the light of the future.In this haunting new novel, Carlos Ruiz Zafón proves yet again that he is a masterful storyteller and pays homage to the world of books, to his ingenious creation of the Cemetery of Forgotten, and to that magical bridge between literature and our lives.   Read more  ","['5.0 out of 5 stars', '5.0 out of 5 stars', '5.0 out of 5 stars', '5.0 out of 5 stars', '5.0 out of 5 stars', '5.0 out of 5 stars', '5.0 out of 5 stars', '5.0 out of 5 stars']","['\nRight up there with Shadow of the Wind\n', '\nSpell binding read.\n', '\nGreat literature\n', '\nWonderful\n', '\nOne of the best he has written!\n', '\nLove this author\n', '\nLoved it\n', '\nAmazing\n']","['\n\n  One word: remarkable!

  Everything You Need to Know to Begin Reading Tarot CardsFor centuries, Tarot cards have been consulted for divination by those seeking answers from the unseen realms. The Tarot has been credited with illuminating solutions to major dilemmas, and even helping people avoid future misfortunes. The Tarot experience can indeed be empowering, bringing clarity to confusing situations and showing us that we have the ability to shape our future based on the choices we make in the present. Far more than mere “fortune telling,” the Tarot is a tool for meditation and reflection, for seeing new angles that give way to broader perspectives about how we approach our lives. In this 2nd edition of Tarot for Beginners, best-selling author Lisa Chamberlain opens the door for newcomers to the Tarot in her trademark clear and straightforward manner. She dispels old myths and misconceptions about the Tarot, providing an objective look at its origins and its divinatory potential for 21st-century readers. Tailored especially for those who want to read the cards for themselves, this guide offers strategies for getting familiar with each card, a step-by-step breakdown of the process of a reading, options for tailoring the approach to suit your unique style, and advice for getting the most out of reading the cards for yourself.Most guides to the Tarot are centered on a specific deck, such as the Waite-Smith, the Tarot of Marseille, or other decks ranging from the well-known to the rather obscure. While these books can be useful and informative, their card interpretations are largely restricted to the particular deck they focus on. Tarot for Beginners takes a different approach, offering basic card meanings that can be applied to any deck, and used in tandem with any descriptions that accompany the deck you’ve chosen to work with. So no matter which Tarot deck you use, the information in this guide is relevant, providing a solid starting point for a skill you can carry with you for a lifetime.Foundations in the Art of DivinationTarot can be thought of as a kind of language through which we can hear and understand divine messages. This communication comes through the individual cards and through the symbolic system of the deck as a whole. Tarot for Beginners sets you up to learn this language with a thorough grounding in the key concepts surrounding the Tarot, including: The origins and evolution of the Tarot as a divinatory art A comprehensive overview of the Major, Minor, and Court Arcana Tips for choosing your first deck and getting acquainted with your cards Beginner tips and exercises for interpreting the cards Instructions for the basic 3-card spread and the 10-card Celtic Cross, two of the most widely-used spreads in contemporary Tarot A step-by-step process for conducting Tarot readings Advice on reading the cards for yourselfCore meanings of each card in the standard Tarot deckThe art of Tarot takes time and experience to master, and your willingness to study the cards, practice reading, and hone your intuition will be key to your development as a Tarot reader.

  I have found rock bottom. It's here, moving in with my older brother because I'm too broke to afford to live on my own. It's okay though, because we've always been close and I think I'm going to have fun living with him again.That is until I meet Cooper...Turns out, my brother has very strong opinions on the idea of me dating his best friend and is dead set against it. According to him, Cooper is everything I should stay away from: flirtatious, adventurous, non-committal, and freaking hot. (I added that last part because I feel like you need the whole picture.) My brother is right--I should stay away from Cooper James and his pretty blue eyes. He's the opposite of what I need right now.Nah--who am I kidding?

It’s funny and gripping, not to mention filled with emotion and romance. It’s a closed door romance, so the most “action” you will read about is a heated kiss, but that didn’t bother me at all. The character development and romantic progression was enough for me.Cooper was a great character. Honestly, I don’t know how anyone couldn’t like him. I enjoyed Lucy‘s quirkiness, but I can see have some people might find it a little over the top. Either way, they seemed to click and compliment each other.Another reviewer commented on how she didn’t think Lucy was a good mother. I can’t say as I agree with the statement at all. I was worried that I wouldn’t like this book on account of the fact that Lucy might come across as something of an absentee, deadbeat mom, but I didn’t find that at all. Just because she allowed other people, such as her mom, to help care for her child didn’t make me think she loved him any less. Not even remotely.I found this book very satisfying and look forward to reading the next book in the series. :-)\n\n', '\n\n  For the main plot of this book to be the MC has a kid, there are quite literally four entire interactions with the kid throughout the book. There was even a nod from the MC that “I’m not some woman who goes and gets knocked up and then leaves her kid with someone else” and that was literally what happened throughout the whole book. In fact, the main thing we learn about is that she has a mom body and that seems to be more important than the kid lol. It’s a short book, I get that. Maybe this plot was too big for 291 pages. This one fell flat, sadly.\n\n', '\n\n  Love Sarah Adams’ sense of humour, quick wit, hilarious writing style. Sweet, clean and heartwarming love story. I’m starting Book 2 now…\n\n', '\n\n  I really enjoyed this book. Several times the characters made me laugh out loud. It was the perfect light read.\n\n', '\n\n  This was so sweet. There were some sassy moments and Lucy was a super relatable mom to a 4 year old. I’m talking ‘can’t be bothered to shave her legs’ relatable, ‘talks about her mom bod and all the joys that come with it’ relatable. I want to be her friend, she seems like my kind of girl.Cooper - heeey Cooper! He’s a pretty swoony, confident without being cocky, hero and I enjoyed the dynamic between him and Lucy immensely.Sarah Adams’ writing style is right up my alley. Easy to read and I love that she breaks down the fourth wall. It’s not Fleabag or The Office levels of talk to the camera but it has the feeling of ‘this is how she talks to her friends’ kind of asides and I was digging it.I will be reading more of her books which is saying something because there was no steam whatsoever. There was swoon and some heated kisses but it wasn’t even closed door because I can’t say if they sealed the deal for sure.If you enjoy Sophie Ranald books, you’ll enjoy Sarah Adams.\n\n', '\n\n  I have to say, that book was so well written and funny. I envy the talent of the author and just for that, and the amazing alchimie between the protagonists, I give  it 5 stars.However, it terms of taste, I\'m not really fond of ""love at first sight because the guy is soooo hot"". The magic, for me, died the first chapters. BUT, knowing the author (""my ennemi"" being one of my favorite book of all time), I knew I was in for a metal ride and I was right!Passing the details about how sexy, and sexy, and hyper sexy was Cooper (with too many descriptions to feel romance instead of lust), the story was amazing. No dramas (I hate dramas!),  Amazing conversations and flirts, and so many funny situations!Did I say I love the author\'s writing? Can\'t wait  to read the story of Jessie!!\n\n', '\n\n  Fa. Bu. Lous. This book was AMAZEBALLS!!! I almost peed myself laughing and wooo! The romance was STEAMING HOT! (But relatively clean. I would say PG-13/behind the secedes level of steam.) This author’s writing style reminds me of Becky Monson’s and Sariah Wilson’s and they are a guaranteed buy for me so definitely in my top favourites list. Pretty much a guaranteed 5 stars read. 100% loved this book and recommend it.\n\n', ""\n\n  I'll admit, these novels and author is a new fav. Light, fluffy, goofy, cute... another enjoyable cold winter night's cozy read!\n\n""]"

  As December turns Lake Eden, Minnesota, into the North Pole, the heat is on in Hannah Swensen’s kitchen to honor two Christmas promises: baking irresistible holiday cupcakes and preventing an attempted murderer from succeeding the second time around!   While Hannah speeds through a lengthy holiday checklist, drama in town grows like Santa’s waistline on Christmas Eve. Her sister Andrea wants to stave off the blues by helping out at The Cookie Jar, Michelle’s love life is becoming complicated, Lisa needs Hannah’s advice, and Delores has a Christmas secret she’s not willing to share. But nothing dampens the holiday mood more than the chilling mystery surrounding the man found near death in an abandoned storefront two doors down from Hannah’s bakery . . .   The befuddled John Doe can’t recall a thing about himself—except for his unusual knowledge of restoring antique furniture.

Maas!A cursed woman.A powerful prince.A forbidden love, and an empire hanging in the balance...Decades ago, the High King of Sundolia waged a war that vanquished the Serpent clan and drove them out of the empire, reducing them to nothing more than legends spoken of in occasional frightened whispers.But they did not leave peacefully. Their parting gift included curses that now rest within the empire’s soil, beneath the shade of its jungles, treading through the waves of its seas. Growing more and more dormant as the years pass under the rule of that increasingly tyrannical high king. Until Alaya—a young woman with a hidden Serpent mark who shouldn’t exist—accidentally wakes one of them up. Then another. And suddenly she finds herself exiled from her adopted village and left with no choice but to seek the truth about her lost clan and the so-called curses they left behind. About her true home. About a power, stolen from the Serpent goddess herself, that is supposedly resting in that home. It is the sort of power that could help her overthrow a king, expose the lies he’s told, and put a stop to his wars.The crown prince of Sundolia claims he wants to put a stop to those wars with her. That he only wants to help her find that power so he can undo the horrors his father has created. All they have to do is find a way to trust each other.But the closer they get to that power, the more complicated the truth—and the trust— becomes. The more dangerous Alaya’s waking power seems. And the more she begins to wonder: Can you still be the hero if you were born a curse?

  Mexican history comes to life in this “fascinating” work by the author of Lone Star: A History of Texas and the Texans (The Christian Science Monitor).Fire & Blood brilliantly depicts the succession of tribes and societies that have variously called Mexico their home, their battleground, and their legacy. This is the tale of the indigenous people who forged from this rugged terrain a wide-ranging civilization; of the Olmec, Maya, Toltec, and Aztec dynasties, which exercised their sophisticated powers through bureaucracy and religion; of the Spanish conquistadors, whose arrival heralded death, disease, and a new vision of continental domination. Author T. R. Fehrenbach connects these threads with the story of modern-day, independent Mexico, a proud nation struggling to balance its traditions against opportunities that often seem tantalizingly out of reach.   From the Mesoamerican empires to the Spanish Conquest and the Mexican Revolution, peopled by the legendary personalities of Mexican history—Montezuma, Cortés, Santa Anna, Juárez, Maximilian, Díaz, Pancho Villa, and Zapata—Fire & Blood is a “deftly organized and well-researched” work of popular history (Library Journal).      Read more  ","['5.0 out of 5 stars', '5.0 out of 5 stars']","['\nExcellent History Book\n', '\nEverything you need to know.\n']","['\n\n  Excellent History Book\n\n', '\n\n  This is a great resource which objectively gives a thorough overview of Mexican history.\n\n']"

  “‘A Better Man,' with its mix of meteorological suspense, psychological insight and criminal pursuit, is arguably the best book yet in an outstanding, original oeuvre.” —Tom Nolan, The Wall Street Journal""Enchanting... one of his most ennobling missions."" —Marilyn Stasio, New York Times Book ReviewCatastrophic spring flooding, blistering attacks in the media, and a mysterious disappearance greet Chief Inspector Armand Gamache as he returns to the Sûreté du Québec in the latest novel by #1 New York Times bestselling author Louise Penny. It’s Gamache’s first day back as head of the homicide department, a job he temporarily shares with his previous second-in-command, Jean-Guy Beauvoir.  Flood waters are rising across the province.  In the middle of the turmoil a father approaches Gamache, pleading for help in finding his daughter. As crisis piles upon crisis, Gamache tries to hold off the encroaching chaos, and realizes the search for Vivienne Godin should be abandoned.  But with a daughter of his own, he finds himself developing a profound, and perhaps unwise, empathy for her distraught father. Increasingly hounded by the question, how would you feel…, he resumes the search. As the rivers rise, and the social media onslaught against Gamache becomes crueler, a body is discovered.  And in the tumult, mistakes are made. In the next novel in this “constantly surprising series that deepens and darkens as it evolves” (New York Times Book Review), Gamache must face a horrific possibility, and a burning question.

It is always a joy to read a new book by Louise Penny, and to be transported to her stellar creation, the fictional village of Three Pines, Quebec and its residents.  I not only appreciate the atmospheric storytelling where I can visualize the place and people, but I want to live there. I feel that I already know the villagers. This is the 15th book set in Three Pines, and the author has maintained her usual high quality. These books are police procedural/mysteries. With each new one, we get further insights into the well-developed characters, with all their strengths and human weaknesses.  Chief Inspector Armand Gamache, a kind and wise man, had been head of the Surete du Quebec. After a high risk and mostly successful police raid, some officers were killed or injured.  Gamache was demoted by individuals who resented his power and risk-taking. His loss was to be their political and professional gain. He is offered the position as head of the Homicide Department, never thinking that Gamache would not to prefer to remain retired in disgrace.  He would now be working alongside, but under the command of his son-in-law, Jean-Guy, whom he once mentored and who he chose as his second-Jan-command. Gamache accepts, only wanting to solve crimes in any capacity. Most who knew Gamache still have great loyalty and respect for him. Powerful forces still resent his return to the Surete du Quebec. Vile postings and a fake video are circulating on the internet deploring his new posting. At the same time, Clara’s recent paintings of scenic miniatures are being reviled on social media, with postings indicating the belief that she never had any artistic talent. Clara is distraught, and her friend, Myrna tries to comfort her. They frequently meet at the inn, and the elderly and foul-mouthed Ruth, a prize-winning poet, is often in the background with her pet duck. She manages to keep things stirred up with her nasty comments.  I regret we didn’t see more this time of Gabi and Oliver, owners of the inn. A catastrophic flood is threatening Montreal and also Three Pines. Most of the police force have been deployed to handle a possible natural disaster. Sandbags are being piled up along the river at Three Pines. A father, Homer Godin is frantic about his missing daughter, Vivienne, who he thinks was on her way to see him. She was married to a domineering and abusive husband, Carl, who did a bit of farming and dabbled in creating pottery.  She was the victim of his beatings and was kept isolated from her father and potential friends.When her body is found it is believed she was escaping the abusive husband and was murdered. She was pregnant at the time of her death, and Carl is the prime suspect.  Jean-Guy heads up the murder investigation. This is to be his final case as a police officer as he is soon moving to Paris to work in the private sector. Carl goes on trial charged with the killing of his wife but is freed due to technicalities.  Homer, her father, is enraged, as Gamache assured him that Carl would be convicted and punished. Homer vows to kill Carl. He is moved into Gamache’s home, with the aim of protecting him from murdering the most likely suspect in his daughter’s death.The pace slows down as Jean-Guy, Gamache and team sit around discussing clues and evidence to order a new trial for Carl. They also ponder other possible suspects, their relationships with Vivienne, possible motives and methods.The murder investigation speeds up with a dangerous, pulse-pounding climax. There are some twists and help from unexpected sources during which a very complex plot is revealed.  Recommended.\n\n', '\n\n  Although this is one of my all time favourite series I don’t think I can rate this as one of the best in the series. While this book includes all the familiar great features of this series like the typical Three Pines weather, the great food and the cozy comforts of the Bistro and the collection of our old friends along with some new residents and “come-from-aways”  it is quite different from any of the preceding books. There are actually three quite separate storylines running here which is not uncommon in this series but in this case they don’t all merge into one finale and in fact I think Clara’s story has really nothing to do with the rest of the stories, didn’t advance the main plot in any way but just slowed down the reading and only served to introduce another new character with hints that she may become a resident of Three Pines. I found the first quarter to a third of this book involving the big flood much slower reading than any of the previous books and appears to be mainly a chance for Ms Penny to get in some social commentary about climate change which is a very relevant and current topic in Quebec at this time. Of course it does provide the setting for the murder and when that happens the whole pace of the book picks up immensely and also it’s not the only social commentary as the main plot involves not one but two abusive husbands. I don’t think I can ever remember Armand and Jean Guy in any earlier book having such tunnel vision and such a strong conviction that they had identified the murderer and spending all their investigation in trying to find evidence against him while ignoring the real killer who I suspected very early although I hadn’t yet figured out the motive so the big climax was no real surprise to me. And that’s more surprising because there were so many other possible suspects and motives thrown in. I think Ruth Zardo is the best character in Three Pines with Rosa a close second and it sure is nice to see Ruth playing such a major role in this episode. The resolution of the smear campaign against Armand came as a bit of a twist but we never learn who “they” are that want him out of the Surete except for the Premier of Quebec. It will be interesting to see where Ms Penny takes Armand and Three Pines now that Jean Guy has moved to Paris. Oh well I guess we have to wait another year to find out!\n\n', ""\n\n  Another incredible twisted murder mystery that affects everyone in different ways...  A so-satisfying story. I couldn't put it down!I wouldn't recommend a reader new to this author/series starting with this book.  There's so much in it, echoes, hints, and crumbs from previous books, all important to understand the magnitude of Gamache's challenges.  Oh my...Highly recommended!!\n\n""]"

  'This one blew me away! I was hooked from start to finish. Felt like I was right there with the characters going through what they were. This is my first from this author but definitely not my last.' - Netgalley reviewer,⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐""Schoolgirl missing"", the ticker reads, and the camera cuts to a girl’s face. Blonde hair waterfalling over her shoulders, serious eyes, lips a little parted like she’s about to speak. That’s when I realize I’ve been holding my breath, because the gasp when I inhale almost chokes me.Sadie Kelly has lost her job. Until last month, she was a teacher at Horton College – the same high school she went to ten years ago along with her best friend, Fiona. But Fiona died in a tragic accident on their graduation night, and since then nothing’s been the same. Now Sadie’s back in her home town, living with Fiona’s mother, the woman who has watched over Sadie since she was a little girl, and the one person Sadie would do anything to protect. But when Sadie hears that star student Devon Hundley has gone missing from Horton College, everything changes. Because Devon is the daughter of Philip Hundley - a wealthy school donor, local doctor, and a man Sadie knows all too well. And Sadie can't help remembering the last time she saw Devon - and heard her whisper something Sadie's been trying ever since to forget...A 2020 top new release, The Silent Daughter is domestic suspense at its best: a twisty page-turner about family secrets and dangerous lies for fans of Diane Chamberlain, Liane Moriarty, and Adele Parks. PRAISE FOR THE SILENT DAUGHTER:“This is Claire Amarti's debut, and she aced it in my opinion. I read this novel in less than 24 hours and if it wasn't for being a mom and wife I probably would have finished it in one sitting. ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐” -Goodreads review“This story catches your attention from the beginning and holds it all the way through to the last page.

I didn’t have any idea how the story would end.  ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐” -Goodreads review“The Silent Daughter had me turning pages wanting to know how this all was going to end. I felt it all came together with no loose ends and was glad that the ending wasn't rushed. ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐” -Goodreads review“This is definitely one of those books that will have you saying just 1 more chapter and before you know you finished the book! I really enjoyed all aspects of it.”- Netgalley reviewer“The author did a fantastic job… I also think the setting for the book is perfect!

  ADVISORY FROM THE AUTHOR:  This novel contains sexual situations and adult content.  It has very little history.  If you like your romance novels to be light on sex scenes and heavy on the history, this isn't the book for you.  It is the sixth and final book in the Kellington series, but it's a stand-alone novel.  To catch you up....the Duke of Lynwood and his four siblings all found love.  Now, it's their friend's turn.When Bow Street Inspector Joseph Stapleton is sent to Oxfordshire to help the daughter of an earl, little does he know how the mission will affect him personally. Lady Evelyn Williams must marry within weeks, but she has never met a gentleman of the ton whom she would even consider as a potential husband.  Then she encounters the brave, handsome man from London.NEVER TURN AWAY is the story of a love that defies society's expectations.  It also introduces Colin Emerson, Lord Ridgeway, whose story is told in ALWAYS COME HOME.

I loved the character of Joseph, and Lady Evelyn was a great match for him.As much as he lamented that he was to far beneath her to ask Evelyn to marry him, once she's at his house, Joseph comes out with the proposal pretty quickly.  And I have to say, the snippet at the end that Ms. Driscoll actually cut from the book - about how Joseph almost got killed - I wish she had kept that in.  As it is, it just seems a little to tidy that Evelyn was drugged and moved, yet once Joseph and the Kellington's arrive at the house, Ridgeway says he knows where Robert hangs out and when Evelyn is escaping and opens the door, there is Joseph.  I liked the version she took out better - especially as it had the women helping!I am, however, now totally hooked on reading Ridgeway's story.\n\n"", '\n\n  Inspector Joseph Stapleton long became an important character in the Kellington family series and as such it is only fitting that his good friends want to see him live ""happily ever after.""

But as time passed, David discovered the other side of Thurston Crow, the ex-con with his own code of ethics that justified cruelty, violence, lies—even murder. Intimidating David with beatings, Thurston coerced his son into doing his criminal bidding. David’s mom, too mentally ill to care for her children, couldn’t protect him.Through sheer determination, David managed to get into college and achieve professional success. When he finally found the courage to refuse his father’s criminal demands, he unwittingly triggered a plot of revenge that would force him into a deadly showdown with Thurston Crow. David would have only twenty-four hours to outsmart his father—the brilliant, psychotic man who bragged that the three years he spent in the notorious San Quentin State Prison had been the easiest time of his life.Raw and palpable, The Pale-Faced Lie is an inspirational story about the power of forgiveness and the strength of the human spirit.“Cinematically gripping.”—Kirkus Reviews“Empowering missive about the long shadow cast by an abusive parent.”—Publishers Weekly“For fans of Tara Westover’s Educated, The Pale-Faced Lie . . . is a disturbing yet captivating memoir about how one man’s psychotic delusions can imprison an entire family.”—New York Journal of Books  Read more  ","['1.0 out of 5 stars', '5.0 out of 5 stars', '5.0 out of 5 stars', '5.0 out of 5 stars', '5.0 out of 5 stars', '5.0 out of 5 stars', '5.0 out of 5 stars', '4.0 out of 5 stars']","['\nReally Bad\n', '\nClear your calendar-you wont put this down!\n', ""\nCouldn't put this book down\n"", '\nEXCELLENT BOOK\n', '\nThe Pale-Faced Lie: A True Story\n', '\nPoignant and gripping read.\n', '\nEmotionally gripping\n', '\nGripping Story of  father and son\n']","['\n\n  I started to read this book and thought: ""This can\'t be right"".

His mother was cruel with neglect, and his father was insane and violent, and yet David searched for love from them . To me, that's what this book was about....rising above with tenacity and perseverance and guts because you have to, and loving no matter what.  It amazes me what strong minded people can do.\n\n"", '\n\n  When Covid stopped our weekly ladies tennis matches in Chicago, my group of girlfriends decided to create a zoom book club so that we could still get together!

The book was SUCH a good read (hard to read as it just tore at my heart strings, but soooo important) & getting to him through Zoom was just incredible! He\'s SUCH a survivor- breaking through the cycle of abuse & neglect rather than continuing the cycle. He candidly spoke to us about the power of forgiveness in his life and I am just so honored to have been given the opportunity to meet with him. I hope you all will read this book. He also donates a portion of each book sold to The Barrett House (a homeless shelter for women)\n\n', '\n\n  Re: The Pale-Faced Lie: A True Story - Whoa, if you thought you had a crazy family, you should read this book.

Mostly because it showed what children sometimes have to endure from their parents.  The damage, abuse, heartache, choices, neglect, you name it.

  USA TODAY BESTSELLERTessa Bailey is back with a Schitt’s Creek-inspired rom-com about a Hollywood “It Girl” who’s cut off from her wealthy family and exiled to a small Pacific Northwest beach town... where she butts heads with a surly, sexy local who thinks she doesn’t belong. As seen on E!Online, PopSugar, CNN, EliteDaily, Vulture, Buzzfeed, Bustle, the Nerd Daily, PARADE, LA Magazine, Country Living, USA Today, and more!Piper Bellinger is fashionable, influential, and her reputation as a wild child means the paparazzi are constantly on her heels. When too much champagne and an out-of-control rooftop party lands Piper in the slammer, her stepfather decides enough is enough. So he cuts her off, and sends Piper and her sister to learn some responsibility running their late father’s dive bar... in Washington.Piper hasn’t even been in Westport for five minutes when she meets big, bearded sea captain Brendan, who thinks she won’t last a week outside of Beverly Hills. So what if Piper can’t do math, and the idea of sleeping in a shabby apartment with bunk beds gives her hives. How bad could it really be? She’s determined to show her stepfather—and the hot, grumpy local—that she’s more than a pretty face.Except it’s a small town and everywhere she turns, she bumps into Brendan. The fun-loving socialite and the gruff fisherman are polar opposites, but there’s an undeniable attraction simmering between them. Piper doesn’t want any distractions, especially feelings for a man who sails off into the sunset for weeks at a time. Yet as she reconnects with her past and begins to feel at home in Westport, Piper starts to wonder if the cold, glamorous life she knew is what she truly wants. LA is calling her name, but Brendan—and this town full of memories—may have already caught her heart.   Read more  ","['5.0 out of 5 stars', '5.0 out of 5 stars', '5.0 out of 5 stars', '5.0 out of 5 stars', '5.0 out of 5 stars', '2.0 out of 5 stars', '5.0 out of 5 stars', '5.0 out of 5 stars']","['\nAll the hype about this book is true!\n', '\nTHIS BOOK IS THE END ALL BE ALL OF CONTEMPORARY ROMANCE\n', '\nTHE BEST\n', '\nPrice\n', '\nWorth the hype\n', '\nIt’s ok\n', '\nPerfection!\n', '\nMoving to Westport!\n']","['\n\n  Everyone on booktok was talking about this book. Saying it was the book of the summer. The book was super spicy. That the male character was the king of dirty talk. Let me say, I have been deceived by booktok before and talked into reading a slow burn where a kiss doesn\'t happen till nearly 70% into the book...when everyone called it ""spicy"".I\'m happy to say that everything people said about this book is true. This book is very spicy. This book is hot and the relationship between our two main characters is perfect. This book should be made into a movie. The book felt very in tune with our current culture. We have a woman who doesn\'t have a job except for being an influencer. She\'s banished to a small seaside town. Falls in love with a ship captain. It\'s a beautiful sexy story.\n\n', '\n\n  Synopsis: Brendan is a widowed, steady sea captain content to live out the rest of his life in peace in Westport. Until Piper stumbles in that is. Piper is an LA wild child of the influencer variety serving out her sentence in her father’s hometown. The two are polar opposites, but sometimes opposites attract.Review: Okay. I don’t even know where to start. It took me like a month to write this review because I don’t even know how to do Piper and Brendan justice and I don’t even know how to phrase my adoration, honestly. I picked this up because of a tiktok that I saw and at risk of sounding even more dramatic than I already do, this book genuinely helped me realize that I still love reading and helped end a VERY long reading slump.If you love grumpy x sunshine, if you love forced proximity, if you love gruff, wild men, if you love spice (!!!!!!), you will love this book.Now if you haven’t read this yet, be aware, some spoilers ahead!Piper and Brendan are just TO DIE FOR. I love them, I love them, I love them. I was genuinely rooting for their relationship so hard (while simultaneously also wanting Brendan to be mine???And to spoil me rotten???). The character development of each of them individually and also together was so satisfying.Piper is introduced as this ditzy, bratty, stuck-up LA wild child but almost immediately, you start to see layers of her that are so much more than that. Her relationship with Hannah sets the scene for what you’ll be able to see for the rest of the book. She’s fiercely protective of Hannah and loves her completely. The scene where she tries to cook Hannah dinner is such a sweet scene, even if it doesn’t necessarily pan (HA!) out. When you find out that she made space in her luggage, which one can only imagine to be a huge deal for someone as fashionable as Piper, for Hannah’s records, my heart. I’m such a softie for a good sibling relationship. You get to see her develop to so much more and learn so much about her.On the other hand, Brendan is introduced as a total douche (thanks Pipes!). But again, almost immediately you start to see more of him. Brendan helping Piper with the ingredients and instructions for Bolognese, wholesome, my heart. When you learn about his marriage and his wife, so much more comes into view for why Brendan is the way he is.Their relationship is chemistry-ridden, adorable, fiery, incredible, loving, magical, SPICY SPICY SPICY (shall I go on?).I loved, loved, loved reading about these two and I love, love, love how everything turned out.I can’t wait to read about Hannah and Fox in the next book and I also can’t wait to re-read this book a million and one times every time I need a pick me up.\n\n', '\n\n  I was always skeptical about this book. TBut then when I opened it, damn! I cannot put the book down.One thing tho, it would be better if the book was actually as first-person POV and not a third-person POV. Although, it still made an impact and nice delivery of each character’s emotions and stuff.\n\n', '\n\n  Can’t give this a rating, it’s a Christmas gift for m6 granddaughter\n\n', '\n\n  Fantastic story, worth the hype.\n\n', '\n\n  Decent read but got sloppy towards the middle and end.

Tessa builds a world and tells a story that is so vibrant, so clear, you can’t help but be there with the characters, experiencing everything with them. The attraction, the steam between these two, it snaps and crackles and sizzles. The doubts and fears, they radiate and envelope. The joy and happiness will invade your heart and soul. Piper and Brendan don’t appear to be perfect for each other at the start, but as their story is told, it is apparent to everyone that they are exactly what the other needs <3\n\n', ""\n\n  I don't read a ton of rom-coms and generally only read dark romance but everyone has said such good things about this book that I couldn't help myself.And man am I so glad I did. It was SO freaking good.Piper is externally the typical spoiled rich girl and Brendan is the rugged widowed fisherman who likes things to run predictably. It shouldn't work... but the two of them disrupt each others worlds in the best way.Piper brings the chaos, the sunshine, the magnetism. And Brendan shows her what it is to truly be valued and loved for every single inch of who she is.They each complete and teach each other things that no one else could. It isn't about changing each other - it's about finally being comfortable to be their true selves, especially in Piper's case.I loved their banter, the quirkiness of the town and all of its wonderful citizens.And this is spicy - Tessa doesn't hold back when writing! Piper and Brendan are explosive and passionate and spicy as hell.Loved this book.\n\n""]"

  The instant #1 New York Times bestseller! “It's the best memoir I've ever read.” —Oprah Winfrey“Will Smith isn't holding back in his bravely inspiring new memoir . . . An ultimately heartwarming read, Will provides a humane glimpse of the man behind the actor, producer and musician, as he bares all his insecurities and trauma.” —USA TodayOne of the most dynamic and globally recognized entertainment forces of our time opens up fully about his life, in a brave and inspiring book that traces his learning curve to a place where outer success, inner happiness, and human connection are aligned. Along the way, Will tells the story in full of one of the most amazing rides through the worlds of music and film that anyone has ever had.Will Smith’s transformation from a West Philadelphia kid to one of the biggest rap stars of his era, and then one of the biggest movie stars in Hollywood history, is an epic tale—but it’s only half the story. Will Smith thought, with good reason, that he had won at life: not only was his own success unparalleled, his whole family was at the pinnacle of the entertainment world. Only they didn't see it that way: they felt more like star performers in his circus, a seven-days-a-week job they hadn't signed up for. It turned out Will Smith's education wasn't nearly over.  This memoir is the product of a profound journey of self-knowledge, a reckoning with all that your will can get you and all that it can leave behind. Written with the help of Mark Manson, author of the multi-million-copy bestseller The Subtle Art of Not Giving a F*ck, Will is the story of how one person mastered his own emotions, written in a way that can help everyone else do the same. Few of us will know the pressure of performing on the world's biggest stages for the highest of stakes, but we can all understand that the fuel that works for one stage of our journey might have to be changed if we want to make it all the way home. The combination of genuine wisdom of universal value and a life story that is preposterously entertaining, even astonishing, puts Will the book, like its author, in a category by itself.

However now I don’t like Will. I appreciate that he was so honest in the book, and he has taken an emotional journey. I just don’t care for where he landed. When for the first time he turns down an autograph for a Downs syndrome kid……that was it for me. If Will hasn’t figured out how to pick your spots. Pick your moments. Act graciously. Not all or nothing (like the autograph scenario) - then his journey failed him. I also don’t care for his arrogance. Yes he couches it with “I’m not being arrogant, it’s real fact” kind of,thing, but that jus makes it sound worse. There are ways to validate, protect and realize yourself, with grace and not at the expense of others.  Right after I finished the book I saw on ET that he did some scary stunt in public and I though - “there he goes again, vying for attention”. I find it childish, sorry. I thought he was a better person. I guess his journey to becoming a great person —— will continue…..\n\n', ""\n\n  I have zero complaints about the actual book. Will is am amazing author.

Here it goes:“The physics of love and happiness are counterintuitive.  As long as we are stuck in the need to receive - in the cycle of grasping and clinging and demanding that people and the world around us meet our needs - we will be locked into disappointment, anger, and misery.  The sweet paradox is being fulfilled by giving, that your output precipitates the input - giving and receiving become simultaneous.  To love and to be loved is the highest human reward and ecstasy.  Allowing the best within you to serve and unleash the best within others is the most intense of human pleasures.”This book is a must-read for everyone.The self-growth journey is not an easy one, but on the other side of healing lies true freedom.\n\n"", '\n\n  This book is so well written and for me there are several light bulb, life changing moments. I couldn’t put the book down. Will Smith has done it again. This real and honestly raw side of him is even more impressive than the movie star version. I love him even more after reading this book. So welldone!!\n\n', ""\n\n  This book is all about Will Smith & it's very interesting & my wife loves it\n\n"", '\n\n  Hi, I received my book and it is great quality and sounds like a good read but it is suppose to be autographed by Will and isnt.

  Katherine Arden’s bestselling debut novel spins an irresistible spell as it announces the arrival of a singular talent with a gorgeous voice.   “A beautiful deep-winter story, full of magic and monsters and the sharp edges of growing up.”—Naomi Novik, bestselling author of UprootedWinter lasts most of the year at the edge of the Russian wilderness, and in the long nights, Vasilisa and her siblings love to gather by the fire to listen to their nurse’s fairy tales. Above all, Vasya loves the story of Frost, the blue-eyed winter demon. Wise Russians fear him, for he claims unwary souls, and they honor the spirits that protect their homes from evil. Then Vasya’s widowed father brings home a new wife from Moscow. Fiercely devout, Vasya’s stepmother forbids her family from honoring their household spirits, but Vasya fears what this may bring. And indeed, misfortune begins to stalk the village.  But Vasya’s stepmother only grows harsher, determined to remake the village to her liking and to groom her rebellious stepdaughter for marriage or a convent. As the village’s defenses weaken and evil from the forest creeps nearer, Vasilisa must call upon dangerous gifts she has long concealed—to protect her family from a threat sprung to life from her nurse’s most frightening tales.Praise for The Bear and the Nightingale“Arden’s debut novel has the cadence of a beautiful fairy tale but is darker and more lyrical.”—The Washington Post“Vasya [is] a clever, stalwart girl determined to forge her own path in a time when women had few choices.”—The Christian Science Monitor“Stunning . . . will enchant readers from the first page. . . . with an irresistible heroine who wants only to be free of the bonds placed on her gender and claim her own fate.”—Publishers Weekly (starred review)“Utterly bewitching . . . a lush narrative . . . an immersive, earthy story of folk magic, faith, and hubris, peopled with vivid, dynamic characters, particularly clever, brave Vasya, who outsmarts men and demons alike to save her family.”—Booklist (starred review) “An extraordinary retelling of a very old tale . . .

It is my all time favourite series because it is dark, gloomy but shows the human potential. I also love Neil Gaiman, Terry Pratchett......It has the right amount of romance with a perfect twist. The characters were brilliantly described, real and relatable. This book speaks of humanity,  determinism, love and questions the perception of bad and good. I can see that hard core religious people will not like it as it touches on fanaticism, blame and desire. I read reviews that complained about this very subject- that he author gave her ""subjective"" view on religion. HOW dare she speaks her mind and is being critical!! The story takes place in the medieval time of Russia after all. Kathrin Arden beautifully depicts that coexisting with one another is of essence and the price we pay if we choose to not do so. I will definitely read it again.\n\n', '\n\n  An engaging, dark fantasy mired in Russian folklore. It is a fast moving book that captures you, weaves you into the frigid forests of northern Rus’ and delivers an enchanting story line with an irresistibly likeable protagonist. It’s full of magic and monsters, heartache and a dash of romance. The communion with old world Magicks is nearly palpable.\n\n', ""\n\n  I haven't read any other reviews, so I may be repeating what others have already said.What I liked: You can tell that the author did put a fair amount of time into researching the period. I loved the details about the food, medieval Russian iconography, the social aspects of the countryside vs the city, and so on (don't worry, it's not dry at all, just details sprinkled in for flavour). I also enjoyed the way she played with Slavic mythology, and the characterization was generally very well-done - every character had a distinct personality and different and realistic motivations. I enjoyed the fairy-tale aspects, the introduction to the various folkloric entities, and the way the mythological world interacted with the mundane.What I didn't like so much: While there were many tropes present in this story that I greatly enjoyed, the main character, Vasya, came across as a bit of a Mary Sue. It's hard to explain why I feel this way, because the usual traits - for example, everyone loving her regardless of her actions - aren't present. People do dislike Vasya, and sometimes for very good reason. I think it may have been the narrative, and not Vasya herself, that makes me feel this way. She is described often as very fey, strangely alluring, and so on (and she has no idea, of course), in a way that I consciously noticed and pulled me out of the story as I was reading. (There is an important character for whom Vasya is a figure of temptation, and there is symbology and psychology present there to explain his intense feelings, and I actually enjoyed that aspect - it isn't the part that bothers me.) I get that she might be beautiful, and creepy men will absolutely sexualize a teenage girl who is not at all trying to seduce them, but the way the narrative is written implies that Vasya's appeal is factual and not subjective. If it is due to her particular connection to the otherworld, like an aura she projects that gives her this strange appeal despite herself, I hope it is explained in the other books so that I can understand why everyone is apparently being affected by something like a fey glamour.Keep in mind that the above is just a personal pet peeve, but something to look out for if you happen to share it. The book is still a lot of fun, especially if you're interested in stories based on fairy tales, Russian and Slavic folklore, or even the interaction of medieval Christianity with pagan traditions. It reminded me of Naomi Novic's 'Uprooted', which I also enjoyed, but the characters are different enough that it didn't feel repetitive.\n\n"", ""\n\n  Not bad, if you love russian folklore, you'll find some interest, but it's in an old school style. Meaning, the heroine is a girl and well, everybody try to control her. It's kind of historical, I know it's the point, but it would be nice for a change that the family of the girl is actually on her side ... Anyway. Still, there is amazing character (I'm not gonna be a spoiler). The author make great references for anybody who know at least a bit of russian and it is well written. Quick read, it's nice, but probably one time was enough.\n\n"", '\n\n  Excellent! The story reminds me of being a child and disappearing into fairy tales. Strong heroine with none of the swooning foolishness of so many women in fantasy novels... the final scene is riveting! Looking forward to more from this author!\n\n', '\n\n  Great easy read...makes a great beach read! I don’t know much about Russian folklore but you really don’t need to in order to enjoy this story. The author does a great job of explaining certain words in a glossary at the end of the book..which I found helpful. The characters are great and I felt the story progressed at a good pace. Overall great read. This is also book 1 of a trilogy which I’m looking forward to reading.\n\n', '\n\n  Beautiful book. First time reading fantasy genre and I reay enjoyed this. Great characters.

  EldrinThe elves exiled me for my obsession with the human. And now that I have my pet, I'm never letting her go.My assignment is to protect these woods from human interference. It's a nice way of saying, Santa Claus has no use for you on his team anymore. That's fine with me. Making toys all year long for the big boss is infinitely boring. If I can't have Clara, I'm content to be alone, existing on the fringes between my magical world and her earthly one. But what's this? Destiny has given me an unexpected gift, in the prettiest package of all. Clara is here, in the flesh, trespassing in my woods. I've got my own naughty list and there's just one name on it. Let's see if the human can earn her spot on the nice list.ClaraOne more online date, and then I'm done with men for good. I thought a friendly first date at the Christmas tree farm would be fun. Trees, snow, hot cocoa...what could go wrong? But tromping into the off-limits, pristine woods with an ax is NOT part of the plan. Who does this guy think he is? I'm ready to ditch this dude and go back to the farm for some solo holiday fun...until I come face to face with the real danger in these woods. I thought elves were a myth. But turns out? They're real. This mystical creature is tall, terrifyingly beautiful, and not at all what I imagined friends of Santa Claus to look like. And this one? Very protective, very territorial, and extremely not interested in letting me leave these woods. I might not be opening gifts around the tree this year, but I think a very different type of package is waiting for me.Warning: this story is a fantasy about an elf who takes what he wants and makes his human fall in love with him.

  Now available in one collection, four classic crime thrillers from the award-winning “French master of noir” (Observer)Unravelling like a paranoid nightmare, Bird in a Cage melds existentialist drama with thrilling noir to tell the story of a man trapped in a prison of his own making. Crush is a chilling 1950s suspense story of youthful naivety, dark obsession—and the slippery slope to murder. The Executioner Weeps is the winner of the 1957 Grand Prix de Littérature Policière. And The Gravedigger's Bread is a claustrophobic thriller about love gone wrong. All from the French master of noir.In Bird in a Cage, trouble is the last thing Albert needs. Traveling back to his childhood home on Christmas Eve to mourn his mother’s death, he finds the loneliness and nostalgia of his Parisian quartier unbearable. Until, that evening, he encounters a beautiful, seemingly innocent woman at a brasserie, and his spirits are lifted. Still, something about the woman disturbs him. Where is the father of her child? And what are those two red stains on her sleeve? When she invites him back to her apartment, Albert thinks he’s in luck. But a monstrous scene awaits them, and he finds himself lured into the darkness against his better judgment.Crush: Bored with her mundane factory job, her nagging mother, and her alcoholic father-in-law, 17-year-old Louise Lacroix is captivated by a glamorous American couple who moves to her industrial hometown in Northern France. The Roolands' home is an island of color, good humor, and easy living in drab 1950s Léopoldville—a place straight out of Louise’s dreams. Louise is thrilled when she successfully convinces the couple to hire her as their maid. But once she is under their roof, their model life starts to fall apart. Painful secrets from their past emerge, cracks in their relationship appear, and a dark obsession begins to grow. In The Executioner Weeps, it was fate that led her to step out in front of the car. A quiet mountain road. A crushed violin. And a beautiful woman lying motionless in the ditch. Carrying her back to his lodging on a beach near Barcelona, Daniel discovers that the woman is still alive but that she remembers nothing—not even her own name. And soon he has fallen for her mysterious allure. She is a blank canvas, a perfect muse, and his alone. But when Daniel travels to France in search of her past, he slips into a tangled vortex of lies, depravity, and murder. The Gravedigger's Bread: Blaise should never have hung around in that charmless little provincial town. The job offer that attracted him in the first place had failed to materialize. He should have got on the first train back to Paris, but Fate decided otherwise. After a chance encounter with a beautiful blonde in the town post-office, Blaise is hooked. He realizes he'll do anything to stay by her side, and soon finds himself working for her husband, a funeral director. But the tension in this strange love triangle begins to mount, and eventually results in a highly unorthodox burial.   Read more  ",[],[],[]

She was so annoying that I kept having to take reading breaks or else I would have thrown my e-reader across the room.I really liked Leon though (except for his name… what kind of badass demon is named “Leon”?! Might as well have named him Kevin or Bob). He was psychotic, ultra possessive, sadistic, and sweet in his own twisted way — in other words, he was perfect! The smexy scenes were mostly hot AF. I just wasn’t a huge fan of one scene where Leon slapped Rae across the face several times, but otherwise the smexy times were scorching hot!

  This “gripping” New York Times bestseller from the host of CNN podcast Behind the Desk tells the true story—and backstage drama—of late-night comedy (Los Angeles Times).   When beloved host Johnny Carson announced his retirement after thirty years on The Tonight Show, millions of Americans mourned. But inside the television industry, the news ignited a battle between two amazing talents—Jay Leno and David Letterman—who both yearned to occupy the departing legend’s chair. For NBC, it would be a decision with millions of dollars at stake. Soon these two comedians with strikingly different styles, who had once shared a friendship as they worked the clubs together, would be engaged in a fierce competition for the prize.   Based on in-depth reporting and interviews with those involved, and updated with a new introduction by the author—a producer of CNN series The Story of Late Night—The Late Shift is a “vivid, behind-the-scenes, blow-by-blow account” of the fight that ensued, as stars, agents, and executives maneuvered for control of the most profitable program in TV history (Chicago Tribune).   “Remarkably gripping . . . Takes us deep into the bizarre high-stakes world of broadcasting . . . A powerful story, and ultimately a sad one, filled with casualties as well as winners.” —The New York Times Book Review   “Solid reporting, based on extensive interviews with the principals, lifts The Late Shift into a class of its own. . . .

While each story was set in different time periods and unique to the author’s style they all flowed together wonderfully.Legacy of Love by Kristi Ann HunterThis story hooked me right from the beginning with the matchmaking grandmother. I had to laugh at her antics and the way that Randall and Sarah tried to avoid them. I quickly came to care for each character.Gift of the Heart by Karen WitemeyerThis was such a sweet story. Ruth is determined to provide for her daughter and will give whatever needed to do this. Bo agrees to the plan she has presented but wants to stay in the background. I absolutely loved the way that Ruth befriends Bo and helps him learn to become more comfortable around others. The interactions between Bo and Ruth’s daughter, Naomi, were delightful.A Shot at Love by Sarah Loudin ThomasFleeta was a girl with a set plan in place and that plan does not include allowing a guy into her life. However when Hank and Fleeta meet there is instant attraction, neither can stop thinking about the other. Fleeta fights the attraction and tries to move ahead with her plans, but when things take a turn for the worse Hank comes to her rescue and her opinion of allowing him in her life changes. I loved how supportive Fleeta’s family was of her dreams.Because of You by Becky WadeThis was my favourite story. I loved that this story tied in with Becky Wade’s series, the Bradford sisters. Maddie works with Britt and has feelings for Leo but feels like she can let them known. When these two are teamed up together for a Christmas project they end up spending quite a bit of time together and Leo begins to see Maddie differently. Their story is story of healing and moving forward and contained so much depth I was not expecting in a novella. I loved these two and it was easy to root for them to come together.

Maybe a little too easily. She’s always liked people better from afar. But Reagan doesn’t want her grandpa to be alone for Christmas this year—he’s already spent too much time on his own in 2020. So she heads back to her hometown with a dish of holiday Jell-O salad, hoping they can have a little normalcy. Hoping it will be safe…She isn’t expecting to run into the boy next door. Mason is all grown up now. He’s considerate. He’s funny. He doesn’t mind how prickly Reagan is—he maybe even likes it. And it makes Reagan feel like her defenses are falling. She needs her defenses, doesn’t she? In a time when six feet is close enough, how long can they keep their distance?

  INSTANT NATIONAL BESTSELLERNEW YORK TIMES BESTSELLERWINNER of the 2021 Banff Mountain Book Prize in Mountain Environment and Natural HistoryWINNER of the National Outdoor Book Award for Natural History Literature A world-leading expert shares her amazing story of discovering the communication that exists between trees, and shares her own story of family and grief. Suzanne Simard is a pioneer on the frontier of plant communication and intelligence; she’s been compared to Rachel Carson, hailed as a scientist who conveys complex, technical ideas in a way that is dazzling and profound. Her work has influenced filmmakers (the Tree of Souls in James Cameron’s Avatar), and her TED talks have been viewed by more than 10 million people worldwide. Now, in her first book, Simard brings us into her world, the intimate world of the trees, in which she brilliantly illuminates the fascinating and vital truths—that trees are not simply the source of timber or pulp but are a complicated, interdependent circle of life; that forests are social, cooperative creatures connected through underground networks by which trees communicate their vitality and vulnerabilities with communal lives not that different from our own. Simard describes up close—in revealing and accessible ways—how trees, living side by side for hundreds of years, have evolved; how they perceive one another, learn and adapt their behaviors, recognize neighbors, and remember the past; how they have agency about their future; how they elicit warnings and mount defenses, compete and cooperate with one another with sophistication: characteristics previously ascribed to human intelligence, traits that are the essence of civil societies. And, at the center of it all, the Mother Trees: the mysterious, powerful forces that connect and sustain the others that surround them.Simard, born and raised in the rain forests of British Columbia, spent her days as a child cataloging the trees from the forest; she came to love and respect them and embarked on a journey of discovery and struggle. Her powerful story is one of love and loss, of observation and change, of risk and reward. And it is a testament to how deeply human scientific inquiry exists beyond data and technology: it’s about understanding who we are and our place in the world. In her book, as in her groundbreaking research, Simard proves the true connectedness of the Mother Tree to the forest, nurturing it in the profound ways that families and humansocieties nurture one another, and how these inseparable bonds enable all our survival.

A tree gave its life to come to my home, in a large old maple forest in Quebec, to touch me through this book. Touch me it has. I always sensed the trees were communicating.

It explores new and emerging science of how trees communicate and share resources, and exposes the industrial forestry mentality and the flawed volume-based 'free to grow' policy that the BC Government has foisted on the public for decades. The net result is overharvesting, numerous mills closing, 1,000s of kms of degraded riparian habitat, glyphosate spraying of deciduous trees and >1,000+ people arrested protesting old growth logging at Fairy Creek. Meanwhile the multi-national forest companies slip away to their southern US based mills where they have tree plantations (not forests) and cheaper labour and leave the degraded forests to the public to restore.Thank goodness there are scientists like Dr. Simard to expose this!\n\n"", '\n\n  Excellent read on the subject of forest ecology and the role of fungi in forming significant connections among trees in forests.

  WINNER OF THE 2021 SCOTIABANK GILLER PRIZENATIONAL BESTSELLER From the widely acclaimed author of American War: a new novel--beautifully written, unrelentingly dramatic, and profoundly moving--that brings the global refugee crisis down to the level of a child's eyes.More bodies have washed up on the shores of a small island. Another over-filled, ill-equipped, dilapidated ship has sunk under the weight of its too many passengers: Syrians, Ethiopians, Egyptians, Lebanese, Palestinians, all of them desperate to escape untenable lives in their homelands. And only one has made the passage: nine-year-old Amir, a Syrian boy who has the good fortune to fall into the hands not of the officials but of Vanna: a teenage girl, native to the island, who lives inside her own sense of homelessness in a place and among people she has come to disdain. And though she and the boy are complete strangers, though they don't speak a common language, she determines to do whatever it takes to save him. In alternating chapters, we learn the story of the boy's life and how he came to be on the boat; and we follow the girl and boy as they make their way toward a vision of safety. But as the novel unfurls, we begin to understand that this is not merely the story of two children finding their way through a hostile world, it is the story of our collective moment in this time: of empathy and indifference, of hope and despair--and of the way each of those things can blind us to reality, or guide us to a better one.

But Ryan’s unexpected arrival sparks a creative awakening in Kara that inspires the steamy historical romance she desperately needs to deliver.With her wedding duties intensifying, her deadline getting closer by the second and her bills not paying themselves, Kara knows there’s only one way for her to finish her book and to give her characters the ever-after they deserve.

Her best friend is getting married, so she has that stress on top of her work. Before the wedding, Kara meets the groom’s best friend, who happens to be Kara’s ex-boyfriend, Ryan. Ryan was Kara’s first love and they had a devastating break up ten years ago. Now, Kara and Ryan are thrown together in the wedding planning. Spending time with Ryan actually gives Kara inspiration for her novel. Since Kara is finally making progress on her book, she decides to give Ryan a second chance to make their own happily every after.This was such a sweet and emotional romance. I could relate to Kara as a writer. She had written books in the past but she was struggling with her current idea. Sometimes, you just need the right inspiration to keep moving forward. Ryan was the key to finishing her novel. She used the formula of a romance plot to guide her relationship with Ryan, to hopefully make it last this time.Since this was a romance novel, I knew something would happen to divide Kara and Ryan before they could show their strength and become a real couple. Ryan seemed like a dream guy to me, especially since he could discuss romance novels with Kara, which made what he did almost unforgivable. I was so heartbroken for Kara, and I don’t know if I would have forgiven Ryan.

I absolutely loved this book! The Bookstagram references were just added brownie points! I thought the storyline was very fun and unique.

The only thing I didn’t enjoy as much was a 20% portion near the end of the book (I don’t want to ruin anything so I won’t go in details but it kind of felt like a different book altogether).

The writing was great and I will definitely seek out this author’s future books!Thank you to the publisher and NetGalley for providing a free advanced copy of this book in exchange for an honest review.\n\n', '\n\n  TALK BOOKISH TO ME by KATE BROMLEY*Special thanks to #NetGalley and Harlequin Trade Publishing - Graydon House Books for a free, electronic ARC of this novel in exchange for an honest review.*Opening on an energetic note, we’re introduced to our main character, Kara Sullivan (an historical romance novelist, facing blank-page angst after the success of her first novel - with a deadline looming and not a word written she needs a muse fast!). She is arriving at her best friend’s pre-wedding party…  – and just what is a pre-wedding party you ask?  well, it’s  …”basically a casual reception days before the mega-reception.” Kara Sullivan, Talk Bookish to Me.She and her BF discuss the upcoming nuptials ever so casually, and how one of her fiancé’s old friends is standing up with him and that he knows our MC from college. Enter Ryan Thompson. The one person Kara never expected to come face to face with, especially after a 10 year lapse. This is NOT a serendipitous meet cute, oh no – this is a kick in the gut, breath-stopping shocker of a re-meeting; and what does her so-called best friend do?.. but disappear and leave her to deal. Sarcasm and hilarity ensue as these two are forced together time and time again due to wedding revelries [including *gasp* even ‘shacking up’ due to the antics of an overzealous mutt!] and they realize they have some unfinished business.Waffling between hurt and anger and the comfort of a once familiar love, the pattern of fighting and flirting that develops has Kara super confused, but to top it off it ignites her creativity. Uh oh!Could Ryan be the muse Kara so desperately needs or the target {read motive} behind her murder trial?I enjoyed this book immensely. I especially liked how caring Ryan was concerning Kara’s career, the witty, and oft times sarcastic banter between them [I laughed out loud! Not something that happens with many books proclaiming the ‘com’ surname – they seriously lack in the comedy department.] and how well-developed all of the characters were. Despite the some-what predictableness of the plot (oh! But that twist at the ending!) the pace was just right and the humour was on-point with just the right amount of steam.A great beach read under a huge umbrella with a cool beverage!4/5H Little\n\n', '\n\n  Talk Bookish to Me is a heartwarming, witty tale that takes you into the life of the hardworking Kara Sullivan as she juggles her best friend’s wedding, a looming deadline, a mother with high expectations, and an unexpected visit from the one man whom she’s never quite forgotten.The prose is smooth and crisp. The characters, including all the supporting characters, are multilayered, endearing, and amusing. And the plot is a tender, engaging mix of life, love, loss, family, awkward situations, delicious chemistry, romantic drama, tension, introspection, and an adorable bulldog with a penchant for bathrooms, and surprisingly Celine Dion.Overall, Talk Bookish to Me is a charming, smart, uplifting debut by Bromley that I thoroughly enjoyed and is the perfect choice for anyone who loves their romcoms with a lot of heart, hope, humour and heat.\n\n', '\n\n  Kate Bromley, I am now hopelessly devoted to you. This book has ruined me for all rom-com’s in the foreseeable future. The dialogue was hilarious, the characters were extremely likeable, and the story was unpredictable.

  National Book Award Finalist:  An account of the disease that ravaged eighteenth-century Philadelphia, written and illustrated for young readers.   1793, Philadelphia: The nation’s capital and the largest city in North America is devastated by an apparently incurable disease, cause unknown…   This dramatic narrative describes the illness known as yellow fever and the toll it took on the city’s residents, relating the epidemic to the social and political events of the day and eighteenth-century medical beliefs and practices. Drawing on first-hand accounts, Jim Murphy spotlights the heroic role of Philadelphia’s free blacks in combating the disease, and the Constitutional crisis President Washington faced when he was forced to leave the city—and all his papers—to escape the deadly contagion. The search for the fever's causes and cure provides a suspenseful counterpoint to this riveting true story of a city under siege.   Winner of multiple awards, this thoroughly researched book offers a look at the conditions of cities at the time of our nation’s birth, and draws timely parallels to modern-day epidemics.   “A lavishly illustrated book, containing maps, newspaper columns and period illustrations…unflinchingly presents the horrors of the event as well as its heroes.”—The New York Times    “Pair this work with Laurie Halse Anderson’s wonderful novel Fever 1793 and you’ll have students hooked on history.”—School Library Journal   “History, science, politics, and public health come together in this dramatic account of the disastrous yellow fever epidemic that hit the nation’s capital more than 200 years ago.”—Booklist  Read more  ",['5.0 out of 5 stars'],['\nSuperb\n'],"['\n\n  Finally, a great nonfiction book written for children.

The story is fast-paced, fun to read, and filled with amazing fight sequences. If you enjoyed the first two volumes, then this sequel will not disappoint.High stakes are present throughout the book, making the reader incessantly turn the pages to find out what happens next. In the occasional pauses from all the fights, meditation, and self-improvement, there are some exciting interactions and development of characters previously flatly enacted—Thea and Billy. The giant is without a doubt my favorite character. While being impossibly blessed with talent he also possesses a crippling disadvantage in intellect, and his special condition and personality are excellent deliverers of light-hearted moments and dark contemplations.Zac's future path of advancement was briefly hinted at in the previous volume and is further approached in this one, presenting all the individualities and possibilities his unique condition can mature into. However, this would not be a cultivation novel if there were no new powerups, dangerous encounters, and treasures discovered. This book will not disappoint in that regard.Even if the protagonist is building up into an indisputable powerhouse, there are always threats able to end his journey. It is this feeling of mystery, wonder, and apprehension that makes this story so fun to read and hard to put down once started. However, I was still a bit disappointed about the lack of development in the peculiar situation between Zac, his ex, and Alea—it is only briefly discussed, mostly in introspections, and choices affected by the lack of trust and increasing paranoia birthed from their traumatic event. It is a bit of a letdown, but since I was not expecting the story to focus on romance, it can be overlooked and hopefully addressed in future volumes.Book three ends with a lot of promises, new threats, and opportunities that make clear the improvement in both storytelling and plotlines since the story began. I'm, honestly, very excited to read what is to come and how will Zac's unique path change him in the long run. Defiance of the Fall is all a cultivation novel aspires to be and is definitely among the best ones out there.\n\n"", ""\n\n  The main character is great, he is relatable, the pacing is perfect, characters make sensible choices, none of the conflict due to misunderstandings that is so common in fiction.

  NEW YORK TIMES BESTSELLER • Pulitzer Prize winner Elizabeth Strout explores the mysteries of marriage and the secrets we keep, as a former couple reckons with where they’ve come from—and what they’ve left behind. ONE OF THE TEN BEST BOOKS OF THE YEAR: Maureen Corrigan, NPR's Fresh Air • ONE OF THE BEST BOOKS OF THE YEAR: The New York Times Book Review, The Washington Post, Time, Vulture“Elizabeth Strout is one of my very favorite writers, so the fact that Oh William! may well be my favorite of her books is a mathematical equation for joy. The depth, complexity, and love contained in these pages is a miraculous achievement.”—Ann Patchett, author of The Dutch HouseI would like to say a few things about my first husband, William. Lucy Barton is a writer, but her ex-husband, William, remains a hard man to read. William, she confesses, has always been a mystery to me. Another mystery is why the two have remained connected after all these years. They just are. So Lucy is both surprised and not surprised when William asks her to join him on a trip to investigate a recently uncovered family secret—one of those secrets that rearrange everything we think we know about the people closest to us. What happens next is nothing less than another example of what Hilary Mantel has called Elizabeth Strout’s “perfect attunement to the human condition.” There are fears and insecurities, simple joys and acts of tenderness, and revelations about affairs and other spouses, parents and their children. On every page of this exquisite novel we learn more about the quiet forces that hold us together—even after we’ve grown apart. At the heart of this story is the indomitable voice of Lucy Barton, who offers a profound, lasting reflection on the very nature of existence. “This is the way of life,” Lucy says: “the many things we do not know until it is too late.”   Read more  ","['4.0 out of 5 stars', '1.0 out of 5 stars', '4.0 out of 5 stars', '5.0 out of 5 stars', '4.0 out of 5 stars', '5.0 out of 5 stars']","['\nLove Strout’s writing\n', '\nNothing happens\n', '\nA lovely follow up on Lucy Barton\n', '\nAll.

William has discovered that he has a long-lost relative his mother had never previously mentioned. The pair go on a trip to try to reconnect with this newly found relative.This book is a short one - it’s comprised of two chapters and is told entirely from Lucy’s perspective. It’s easy to finish in one sitting. There is not much plot, but it was nice to float along with Lucy’s narrative.I thought there were some great insights on childhood trauma and how the effects of that can carry on into adulthood. One example is how Lucy’s abusive upbringing left her uncertain on how she was supposed to behave “correctly” in her new social sphere as an adult.The second half of the novel is when I became invested in Lucy’s story. Lucy's relationship with William after their divorce was both sweet, funny, and slightly painful.Overall, I enjoyed this conclusion to the Amgash series.

Now William’s third wife Estelle, with whom they have a young daughter, is unhappy with him and moves out.Leaning on each other for support, William invites Lucy on a fact finding trip with him about his past and that of his mother who has passed.I admire the way Strout captures real life. She doesn’t sugar coat how people speak or feel. For example you can still love someone and have them totally piss you off.The writing always draws me in and I come out of my reading time thinking about the lessons that the characters live by.Thank you to @netgalley and @penguinrandomhouse for this ARC in exchange for my honest opinions.

And his legions of fans began asking again: What is Rick Mercer going to do now? Well, for one thing, he's been writing a comic masterpiece. For the first time, this most private of public figures has turned the spotlight on himself, in a memoir that's as revealing as it is hilarious. In riveting anecdotal style, Rick charts his rise from highly unpromising schoolboy (""Rick still owes 15 dollars to the chocolate bar fundraiser"" was one of the less brutal items on a typical report) to heights of TV fame, by way of an amazing break as a teenager when his one-man show, ""Show Me the Button, I'll Push It. Or, Charles Lynch Must Die,"" became an overnight sensation—thanks in part to a bizarre ambush by its target, Charles Lynch himself. That's one story you won't soon forget, and this book is full of them. There's the tale of how little Rick stole a tree from the neighbours that's set to become a new Christmas classic. There's Rick the aspiring actor—hitting the road as a new young punk in a vanload of hippies and appearing on stage in Shakespeare—and a wealth of behind-scenes revelations about This Hour Has 22 Minutes, Made in Canada, Talking to Americans and the coming of the mega-hit Rick Mercer Report. It's a life so packed with incident and laughter we can only hope that a future answer to ""What is Rick Mercer going to do now?"" is: ""Write volume two.""

The Kiss Quotient had been sitting on my TBR list for far too long.I love novels that portray characters with realistic traits.  I’m never on the hunt for that ideal character or couple who epitomizes perfection.  I want to connect with the characters, feel for them, cheer them on, and adore them.  I adored Stella and Michael.Stella is an econometrician.  Numbers are her jam.  While she is a highly successful, career-minded woman, her dating life is less than stellar.  With a mother who “badgers” her about getting a boyfriend, Stella knows that she could use some instruction in the dating and intimacy department.  So, what’s a woman to do but hire a professional escort to show her the ropes.Michael has his reasons for being an escort.  His pretty face gets him enough clients to serve his purpose.  He’s a mixture of gentleman, bad boy, dirty talker, and all-around good guy.  Stella was unlike any of his other clients, but that suited him just fine.  Stella chose Michael because he was pleasing to the eye, but he ended up being so much more.  He was kind, patient, and considerate to her.  For him, it wasn’t a chore to be all of these things to Stella, he truly enjoyed being around her.You can tell from the synopsis that this book is going to have some steamy parts, but the chemistry between these two main characters is off the charts.  I enjoyed witnessing the interactions between Stella and Michael.  The business arrangement that they agreed upon mixed with all of the time that they spent in close proximity to one another created the perfect recipe for romantic tension.There was so much to like about The Kiss Quotient.  Helen Hoang has created a fascinating cast of diverse characters that I immediately liked, especially Michael’s boisterous family.  While the book does contain a lot of steamy scenes, there is so much emotion, heart, sensitivity, growth, and acceptance among the characters.I’m already looking forward to reading Khai and Quan’s stories!\n\n', ""\n\n  “How did one not obsess over something wonderful? How did one like something a reasonable amount?”OKAY, I read this in one frickin day and while I'm super glad I did because I loved it, I also wish I would have savoured it???? I'm also so mad at myself for taking this long to read it because i LOVED IT SO MUCH.The Kiss Quotient is different and fun and it's the perfect mix of sweet and spicy!! Michael and Stella are just SO gah both together and apart. I'm obsessed with both of them!! I really appreciated the representation both of Asian POC and of high-functioning autism. And well TOGETHER THEY ARE JUST amazingggggg. I love them together. Michael was so sweet and kind with her and I thought that a lot of his actions (especially in comparison to Phillip's) displayed a really important conversation about consent which I super super appreciated. I loved loved his backstory and loved getting to know him through that backstory.This is just such an incredible, adorable read and I cannot wait to devour every other book in this series as soon as possible. If you need me, you can find me reading the Bride Test!!!“All the things that make you different make you perfect.”\n\n"", ""\n\n  HIGHLY RECCOMEND READING THIS BOOK! This book is amazing I'm so glad it exists. It was such a good read, there really wasn't a dull moment!The story of a woman with autism navigating the world of relationships and sex whilst having sensory sensitivities and difficulties in certain social areas, (all varying depending on where you are on the spectrum and who you are as an individual), is a real life struggle for people who have autism. It is so important that society becomes less stigmatized and stops alienating people with developmental disabilities. People with a developmental disability have a right/need for love just as any neurotypical person does! It's great to see a story including someone who is neurodivergent, written from their perspective, and on top of that written by an author who is autistic herself, who's has done further research on autism, and other women's experiences to help form this story. It just makes the book that much better; it's more authentic.As a DSP just starting in the field, seeing change in society around stigmas with such developmental disabilities is a passion of mine and this story was so cool. Normalizing life experiences specifically around romantic experiences for people who have a developmental disability is really important and I look forward to a day where society isn't so harsh on uniqueness.It's important to understand that every human being has a right to relationships and every other right a person may have regardless of neurological state and especially if that person is an adult.All in all, I'm so glad I came across this book and that it got published! I'll be looking for other reads from this author, I'm a sucker for romances and this book hit the spot! :)\n\n"", ""\n\n  This book was fantastic. It's unique in that it is written from the perspective of a Vietnamese-American autistic woman who hires an escort to help her with her intimacy issues. The characters are well developed and makes your root for them! It does follow the reverse Pretty Woman storyline and it's a great read!\n\n"", ""\n\n  Like all of her books, this author knows how to tell a really cute story. I like her Asian characters, (there aren't very many books with Asian mcs in it). The story was good and the characters were great. I never felt like there was a dumb misunderstanding in the plot. Someone's, in stories like this, there's some sort of badly made up misunderstanding that causes a huge blow up and I can't stand those. This story was great. Would recommend this author\n\n""]"

If it means saving our family home and business, I’ll do anything.With his strong, sexy, take charge arrogance, Nicolas Dupont is a mystery to me. But it doesn’t matter how hot he is. This is purely a business arrangement. Nic can have any woman he wants and it makes no sense that he'd be interested in a virgin like me. I’m certainly not about to fall for a guy who thinks he can own me.So I go hunting for a way to free myself. When I discover I’m the hunted, and there are those who want my blood, Nic claims he can protect me. But can I trust one of his kind?When this began, I thought I might lose everything. Now I’m not sure if I’ll make it out alive . . .

  When the orcs invaded the human dimension, no one could stop them.

She might as well become what they all say she is – an orc tribute. She doesn’t expect the brutish orcs to welcome her with open arms, especially after she’s had to escape from a horde once, but maybe she’ll have better luck this time. And as beastly as they are, if a captain chooses her as his bride, maybe he won’t betray her. Like her entire family did. Maybe he won’t shun her, maybe he’ll see her for who she really is. In the end, that’s all she wants: to be seen.Baruk the Cursed needs a nanny for his twins. His horde has no females, and the only woman he’s ever loved is gone. When he meets Jenna at the institute for orc brides, he thinks she looks motherly enough. The twins are suffering after their mother’s loss, and the blond, curvy human might just be able to soothe them. As for him… Baruk doesn’t need anyone. Not anymore.

He won’t risk having his heart torn from his chest a second time.Author’s Note: This is a full, standalone novel with a happily-ever-after.

No one writes enemies to lovers romance like Tracy Lorraine.Please note. There is a prequel to this book where our FMC and MMC meet in a graveyard. Please read that small novella first. Its steamy and sets you up for the entire first book in the series.Stella has been moving around the USA with her dad going from school to school for as long as she could remember. With her father, she’s moved to England to finish off high school. One night, she met a stranger in a graveyard and they shared a moment. Little did she know, that stranger holds a lifetime grudge against her. When Sebastian discovers that the woman he met in the graveyard is the daughter of his sworn enemy, he makes it his life’s mission to destroy her. The story takes place at an elite academy where both Stella and Seb are finishing off England’s version of high school.Like I mentioned above, Tracy knows how to write enemies to lovers romance books. What I appreciate most about her writing style, is she doesn’t depict the woman as weak in body of spirit. Stella is a woman who trains MMA daily. She knows how to defend herself and won’t let anyone harm her. Growing up travelling from city to city with her father, she’s used to the solitude and isn’t afraid to be shunned at school.I would say that this story is higher on the spice scale. I find that the main couples sexual preferences contribute to the spice level or the book. There are many descriptive kink scenes which involve knife play, exhibitionism, voyeurism, spanking, and choking.I enjoyed the pace of the story. It wasn’t too fast that you felt like there were pieces missing to the plot line. It also wasn’t too slow that you found parks dragging on. The story does end on a cliffhanger.I was provided an advanced reader copy in exchange for an honest review.\n\n', '\n\n  This book was wicked and so much more! I was so excited to finally get Stella’s book and Tracey Lorraine did not disappoint. I loved every second of this book and I really didn’t want it to end. The banter between Stella and Seb is amazing and I couldn’t get enough. Stella shows no fear when most would cower and shake and enjoys keeping all of the boys on their toes. Seb is all kinds of possessive and dominating.“Right, well, as fun as this little catch-up has been. I’ve got better things to do with my time.” I drop my eyes down his body, my gaze locking on his crotch. “And I’m sure you need to go and ice your balls.”This is the first book part of the Knights Ridge Empire series. This is Stella and Seb’s story and it is a trilogy. I loved this book but I can not wait for the next one because the cliff that I just fell off hit me hard and I need more!!If you do not like dark and twisted this is not the book for you but if you do this is a must read!!I have received a free copy of this book for an honest review.\n\n', '\n\n  DAMN! This is one hell of a dark, twisted and sexy story! It’s definitely an angst filled bully romance that will keep you glued to the pages. The intense hatred, pain and anger thrown around could be felt on every page. It will make you grit your teeth and shaking your kindle. The story is explosive from beginning to end!Stella and Sebastian are like oil and water, a bit toxic and filled with hatred for one another. But the chemistry they have is so intense and ready to combust that it will have your toes curling, your heart beating fast and keep you squirming on your seat.

However, many aspects of her life are controlled, and while she enjoys more freedoms than other women in the Mafia, she still only lives in a golden cage. People would rather see the princess of New York fail than succeed. Tired of this life, Marcella Vitiello makes a decision that could ruin the perfect image she created for herself over the years.

However, I absolutely enjoyed the book and believe it is a must-read for every Cora Reilly fan. Lately, all books that I have started reading could not keep me interested for very long, and I would not finish them. But By Sin I Rise got me out of my reading slump. I was interested in the story and was unable to put the book down.I loved the main characters. Mercella Vitiello is the perfect heroine in my eyes – strong, independent, proud, focused, driven, determined, and passionate. She is not a damsel in distress but rather a complete badass walking around in designer clothes and Louboutins. She is not impressed by the men around her and won’t settle for less than she deserves. She is her father’s daughter in every aspect and is more than capable of becoming a part of the Mafia business. From the beginning, it is clear that the biggest mistake that one could make is to underestimate her. And Maddox, well, Maddox was a very refreshing character and just really sweet. How could one not like him?Marcella and Maddox are connected by a lot more than just mutual attraction, which I enjoyed. Cora Reilly made sure to develop their relationship slowly. Marcella and Maddox understood and opened up to each other. However, their loyalties were tested repeatedly.Marcella and Maddox set the tone for the Sins of the Fathers series and high expectations for the other couples we will meet in later books. I am looking forward to Part 2, and December cannot come fast enough.Get ready to meet some of your favourite characters again, new characters that we have been patiently waiting for, and most of all, get ready for a book that will keep you captivated and interested until the very last page and will make you crave for more!As usual, Cora Reilly outdid herself!***This ARC was kindly provided to me by the author in exchange for an honest review.***\n\n', '\n\n  Intense and passionate characters with a dark and captivating storyline.

It is most certainly a great start to a epic fantasy story. In this world there are different species of people. Each has its own traits such as being compared to frogs, lizards, apes... and each species has their own specific breed/class of mages from rock, fire, vision.. Christopher Mitchell gives each its own unique characteristics related to their species as well and I loved how seamlessly they’re added in.The Queen’s Executioner refers to Sheila who is a high flow mage. In her homeland they suffer from monotony, overcrowding and general dissolution of life. Her sister decides to set off in a great migration and names herself Queen. We get to follow their peril filled journey and the struggles they face in both the decisions they make as well as actual physical danger.We also get to follow some other characters along the way. We have Daphne who starts off being exiled from her homeland and mislead by her ‘friend’. We watch her grow into her magic as a vision mage while she explores the different facets of it.Then there’s Laodoc who starts off in a position of great power. His personal growth is probably the most defined of everyone and he’s got so much inner strength even when his sons abandon him.We have our main three Kellach. Killop who seems to have a predetermined fate he can’t resist, Kallie who feels abandoned and betrayed and Bridget who’s trying to hold them all together.There are other characters along the way, some you will love and some you will love to hate. We are transported between different POV’s and storylines but it doesn’t feel choppy. The events are all happening parallel to each other or directly after and it’s interesting to see the buildup to where the lines may eventually merge in future books. Even though this is a fantasy world many of the struggles faced are ones our current world faces like overcrowding, famine, war and crooked politicians. I look forward to seeing where this series goes next.The Severed City: 5 StarsThe Severed City is the second book in Christopher Mitchell's Magelands epic. It picks up directly where the last book left off. We gain a better understanding of Keira, the fire mage and her motives. She is reunited with Kylon not long after escaping her captivity. We get to follow her and her unlikely troop of 'leftovers' while they are either making a splash in the combined war effort or trying to keep things low key and escape.Killop meanwhile has taken lead as chief of the Severed City. His goal at first is simply to free his people but he makes some unlikely allies along the way. His character arch seems to shift the most in this book as he seems to loose the kind heart we've seen before. You can't overly fault him in this as he's been lied to about something huge.Daphne travels to Plateau City where she's given a royal pardon for her past actions. Ladoc is with her for awhile as is our water mage. Not everyone seems to be welcoming though and there is a bit of drama in her home estate. Nothing's easy, especially her pregnancy.With the five races in this world we gain a better understanding of the forest dwellers. I was surprised at how severe they were. Not all of them came across this way but they showcased more savagery than the other races this time. In general this story doesn't shy away from the ugliness of war or how people find themselves doing things they couldn't even imagine themselves capable of.There's quite a bit of setup and foreshadowing happening. Most notably wondering who's really pulling the strings. You can't help but feel almost everyone is being manipulated and I can't wait to see who's really the chess master.If you love a good fantasy epic then give Magelands a try. You will need to read book one otherwise you'll be lost.Needs of the Empire: 5 StarsWe are once again transported into this world. The characters all have rich personalities and each is unique. There is a description of the races at the start of the book including which type of magical abilities each possesses. This can be very helpful as a refresher if it's been awhile since you read the past books. I would recommend reading this series in order, you would have a hard time following the storylines which are rather complex of you start here.Needs of the Empire takes place a little bit after The Severed City. Keira has already built up and leading the army to try and take down the Empire, they seem quite an unstoppable force as they match towards the capital. Kylon has a bit of a character shift into a darker place.Meanwhile Daphne and Killop are reunited. Their daughter has powers nobody can even imagine. They try and settle into life together at least until Ladoc asks for help. It seems the Old Free aren't very happy their slaves were freed and their trying to take back the city.Sheila is bored in her life as an ambassador but her own government is willing to give her a crown. We even get to see a bit of her family again. It's not a happy reunion but then I doubt anyone expected one.Christopher Mitchell continues to seamlessly weave all the separate parts and paths of this story leaving the reader fully immersed. I though more than once I knew how things would happen but I was so very wrong! Be prepared for a few twists and turns you never see coming.Sacrifice: 5 StarsThis was a great conclusion to the Magelands epic. The title “Sacrifice” really says it all. We follow around the central characters who are working on coming together, even if they don’t realize it.Keira is dealing with the fallout  and tries to push away anyone who wants to get close, mostly because she doesn’t want to endanger anyone.The Holdings is in revolution trying to overturn the Empire and the Hold Fasts are the leaders in that. We get to see Kylon reunite with Killop and swear protection to Karalyn.Meanwhile Ladoc and Agang leave on a quest to locate Shella to fulfill a part of the prophecy. They try an talk Keira into coming but she refuses.The Emperor is leaving total destruction everywhere he goes.I actually spent a great part of this book thinking we were missing a mage. I’d forgotten that Ladoc had small mage powers but once I was reminded I realized it was mentioned in past books.Not wanting to give away any of the story and how things play out I will say I got really invested in this story. The conclusion was an emotional and satisfying journey. I look forward to reading more from this author.\n\n"", '\n\n  You travel with the characters as they go through hard tough years thew war and conflict. Story moves on quickly and slows down in parts were more detail is needed.A real good story that follows anumber of famillies.\n\n', '\n\n  I think this is the best series I have read since Game of Thrones.

Jesse was such an adorable darling—Drew is right that Jesse is easy to love. Drew is awesome too. He understands that he can’t ignore Jesse’s challenges, yet he needs to remember that Jesse is an adult too, capable of making his own decisions. It was intriguing to watch Drew balance taking care of Jesse’s needs, and respecting Jesse’s intelligence and dignity as a human being: to protect Jesse without babying him.I appreciated the point in the book that different people on the autism spectrum have different struggles; there is no generalizing across the ASD community.Jesse was so cute as well when he interacted with animals. Drew mentioned that Jesse was like a child, in that he’s full of youthful vitality, but he isn’t a child per se, as he’s an adult who can take care of himself. So Jesse is child-like but not a child.Drew’s ex was scary; I honestly don’t understand why Drew would even like that guy in the first place. Jesse is obviously a thousand times better both as a partner and as a person.Jesse once raised the question of why some guys like to insult a guy by calling him a girl. True. I don’t see girls insulting a girl by calling her a boy. Very misogynistic indeed.It was astonishing to me that there was virtually no homophobia in the story. Parents, relatives, coworkers, waiters, sales clerks, and others were all very supportive of gay people. This is a pleasant surprise, since I’m so used to seeing terrible homophobic family, friends, or acquaintances. It’s so nice to see this environment where being gay is normalized and accepted. The discrimination that Drew and Jesse faced, was actually towards Jesse’s ASD and ID (intellectual disability), and people’s implicit belief that allistic folks cannot have autistic partners, which is bull, of course. Autistic folks are just people, like everyone else!There was one part where characters discussed whether autistic people can have a “normal romantic relationship.” Drew and Jesse’s answer to this question was a resounding yes. While there are different levels of functioning in ASD individuals, I would agree that in general, yes, it’s possible to have a happy, healthy relationship with someone, even if the couple has to deal with some extra challenges; for example, dealing with prejudice from others.On having autism, I liked how they talked about stimming, which is a self-stimulating gesture (e.g. stroking fur on an animal or a stuffed toy) to calm oneself in the midst of a chaotic world. Jesse also talks about sensitivity to bright lights, loud noises, and other things. I’m glad to read about these, because the sensory sensitivity part of autism isn’t as talked about in wider society, compared to the more “famous” autistic traits, like having difficulties in understanding social cues, and having an obsessive focus on one or a few domains of interest. In addition, it was pleasing to read about an autistic hero who doesn’t fall into the savant or genius stereotype.One of my favorite things about Jesse’s Smile, is the concept of not being “less intelligent” or “bizarre,” but of being different in the way one processes and interacts with the world. It’s a part of natural human diversity to be hyper-sensitive to certain textures, and to desire great order and regularity, among other dispositions. We don’t all have to process and make sense of the world in the same way.The book had an interesting talk about nature, nurture, and personality too. Would Jesse still be himself if he didn’t have ASD, ID, OCD, and dyslexia? Or do these conditions all contribute to making who Jesse is as a person? The nurture piece was thought provoking as well. As the characters put it, Drew had every opportunity handed to him, while Jesse had every opportunity taken from him, though both boys were blessed with loving, supportive families. Jesse and Drew grew up to be sweet and caring people themselves.As for their career success, there was one discomforting moment where their salaries are compared. High school English teachers don’t make a ton, but their income still exceeds that of a pet shop assistant. Some characters in the book pointed out the contrast in their “social stations,” and questioned whether their relationship will work out in the long run. Yet, even though the job of a high school English teacher requires more education, that doesn’t mean that it’s a superior job to a pet shop assistant’s. Moreover, characters do acknowledge later on that the two are so in love, more in love than most couples are, in fact.The references to fandoms like Doctor Who, Star Wars, and Guardians of the Galaxy were entertaining to read. I loved how Drew was a little jealous of Captain Jack from Torchwood: What does Captain Jack have “that a bespectacled English teacher doesn’t?” That made me laugh.Generally, I find it interesting how romance heroes tend to find their partner super beautiful, but would also find an actor very gorgeous. I’ve read some romances as well where they distinguish between the “actor” kind of handsomeness, and the real life kind of wonderful looks. (Perhaps the difference is that actors have professional make-up artists, costume designers, and camera-people to make them look as fabulous as possible. Not that that’s a problem.) In Jesse’s Smile, Drew likened Jesse to a model on the cover of a magazine. As for Drew, many of his students are in love with him. So in romances, I see a few different types of beauty: the actor, the model, the real-life beauty, and the wildly popular pretty boy. (N.B. The actor/ model is not necessarily more beautiful than the real life types. I have some friends in real life who, in my opinion, are even more stunning than an actor!)Drew said that his book on modern poetry only sold about 60 copies. Well, I think that 60 copies are quite a lot for a book that is neither fiction, on a popular topic, nor a required textbook. (If it were a required textbook, he would easily sell at least hundreds of copies.) Drew joked that his mom probably owns 50 of these, but he was clearly just kidding.A final thing I loved about this book, is the adoration and respect towards animals. Several of the animals are referred to by their names instead of by their species, and the human characters frequently include them in their lives and conversations.All in all, a wonderful book!\n\n', ""\n\n  5 starsJesse's Smile is a standalone book. It's about Jesse Peterson, a 26-year-old man who has some challenges and Andrew Oliver, a 34-year-old English teacher. While everyone is quick to assume Jesse can't function alone, Drew helps him grow and treats him as any other young man. Two very different men fall in love to form an amazing couple.Jesse has to be my favorite character hands down. Even with all his challenges, he is smart, sweet, compassionate, amazing with animals and pure (mostly). He is such a unique character with such depth. We honestly do not have enough autistic characters. While he is high functioning, I really did learn a bit about autism.Drew is a very good man. I love that he could look above all Jesse's challenges and love him how he is while not trying to change him. Yes, he did change Jesse but not for own designs but to help Jesse grow as a man.This book was amazing. I laughed and cried and will definitely read it over and over again. It's such a hidden gem. In M/M we do have books with characters who have challenges but we have very few that have such extensive challenges as Jesse and it shows people that they can love too. to not give up on people you do not understand. Amazing work on this book and I can only hope we will see this couple again.*** Copy provided to Bayou Book Junkie for my reading pleasure, a review wasn't a requirement. ***\n\n"", '\n\n  Incredible book.  Ms. Jurd has written an absolutely beautiful story that includes a gamut of emotions coming at the reader from all sides, making us become part of the story.  The plot is engaging, the dialogue is on point, the characters could not be any more likeable, and the mental health issues are so well woven into the story that like Drew, we cannot help but love Jesse just the way he is, no more and no less.  I absolutely loved how the author obviously researched the mental health aspects of Jesse’s personality and became quite knowledgeable about them but she never made the book into a clinical study or a bragging/teaching platform.  She was happy with presenting things and letting readers come to their own conclusions.  I’ve seen so many books where authors fall into the trap of trying to show off their newfound knowledge and make the book almost into a mental health manual.Excellent read, enjoyable, entertaining, and so full of that special quality that makes you feel warm and gooey inside.\n\n']"

Lara is driven and determined to do whatever it takes to live. Her father cares only about his power and is willing to kill whoever stand in the way of his plans (or whoever is even aware of the plan). Lara is shipped to Ithicana where she expects to hate her cruel husband but she discovers a dangerous and wonderful land, ruled by a kind but fierce king and she soon realizes that her father may have not told her the truth about the situation in Maridrina and Ithicana.I really loved this book. The characters are great and there are chapters from Lara's and Arren's point of view. The romance is present, but smooth and sweet in a realistic way. The politic plot to ruin Ithicana is also a big part of the story and I really liked the way that Lara is struggling because she does not know who to help and who to trust, she is not easily swayed just because the king is young and pretty.There is a lot of action and the ending is awesome!\n\n"", '\n\n  An amazing story that I didn’t want to end!

Funny and smart, full of sex and love and people doing their best to connect.” —The New York Times Alice, a novelist, meets Felix, who works in a warehouse, and asks him if he’d like to travel to Rome with her. In Dublin, her best friend Eileen is getting over a break-up and slips back into flirting with Simon, a man she has known since childhood.  Alice, Felix, Eileen and Simon are still young—but life is catching up with them. They desire each other, they delude each other, they worry about sex and friendship and the world they live in. Are they standing in the last lighted room before the darkness, bearing witness to something? Will they find a way to believe in a beautiful world?

In 'Beautiful World, Where are you?' a novel more of conjecture than story, the main character Alice, debates the worth of novels themselves. What does it mean, Alice asks, when you write novels about first world characters, their angst, their preoccupations and struggles, in a world going to hell in a handbasket? She does not use the handbasket cliché because she's too good a writer, with far to firm a grasp on language to write anything quite so obvious, but her conundrum is the conundrum of the obvious. What is novel for and what is the worth of a novelist involved herself and her own petty problems? That Rooney is a novelist writing about a novelist just makes these questions more poignant. Alice, who, like Rooney is successful, asks if she will be able to write again or at least to write fiction again. Will Rooney or will the weight of the world grind her down? If that is a cliché too then it's a cliché the novel is intent on dealing with and in a broader context asks what does art matter? If, indeed, what Rooney and Alice, her alter ego, are doing is 'art'. Yes, it is and the interweaving of the the email debates between Alice and her best friend Eileen, a junior literary editor, with their personal stories: Alice's affair with Felix, a working class warehouse worker and  Eileen's with the politically committed Simon and Eileen's and Alice's own complex friendship make for a reflection both on whether such a novel of manners means anything and whether its concerns are material in the broader scheme of things. The novel nods gently in the direction of an answer that, in fact, the preoccupations of love and life in middle class Ireland have an importance because they are important to the people who have them. Us. That love is important and so are friendships and honesty and attempts to deal with the wider context. Alice wonders about these matters as clearly does Rooney; by expressing them she produces a novel that is worth reading for what happens to the characters and for what it says about what we talk about today and what we should be thinking about even if we cannot solve the problems we see.\n\n"", ""\n\n  I've read Rooney's three books. She's a good writer, and Normal People was particularly well done. But it felt like she wrote 'Beautiful World' to meet a contractual obligation or just because of heavy publisher pressure. Through her central character Rooney is processing the discomfort and ambivalence she feels about her real life success. But for all her skill, she gives no fresh nuance to that discomfort.But then maybe that's intentional. Through much of the book, Rooney keeps the reader outside any of her characters' heads, describing their reactions rather than letting us in on how they actually feel. (Was Normal People like that? I am going to have to re-read parts of it to compare.) There are parts of 'Beautiful World...' where two characters exchange deeply thought emails, but the end result is still a remote perspective.I will very likely read Rooney's next book, if she writes another, but I hope she can be a little less moan-y about the trials of success there and either find an interesting take or\n\n"", '\n\n  When I read Sally Rooney’s first novel, I was impressed by the deceptive simplicity of her easy flowing prose, and her ability for excellent dialogues. With her second one, where she showcased the same maturity and depth of understanding of human nature as in the first one, I declared myself a fan. And after reading this one, her third, I still am. The beauty to be found lurking underneath her writing in some utterly brilliant chapters, as well as the uncanny way in which, with an economy of words, she can convey the depth of feelings or the telling crudeness of a situation, are second to none. Alas, there are some passages in this one that were not entirely to my liking, as I found them verging on political pamphlet rather than genuine reflections. However, invariably, each time I had one of these hypercritical moments, a few lines later I was once again enthralled by her writing.\n\n', ""\n\n  To be honest, I am struggling to finish this book.  I most likely will not.  The storyline is pretty much nonexistent and the characters are weaker yet - they are adults carrying on like they're teenagers.  None of the four are likeable.  In fact, the way the dialogue is presented, often in the form of emails to one another, it is difficult to discern if there's any substance to them at all.  To be sure, there are too many great books to be read and enjoyed, to waste one's time on the likes of this one.  (The one star is rating is for the colourful cover design, by the way.)\n\n""]"

  They came to earth—Pestilence, War, Famine, Death—four horsemen riding their screaming steeds, racing to the corners of the world. Four horsemen with the power to destroy all of humanity. They came to earth, and they came to end us all. When Pestilence comes for Sara Burn’s town, one thing is certain: everyone she knows and loves is marked for death. Unless, of course, the angelic-looking horseman is stopped, which is exactly what Sara has in mind when she shoots the unholy beast off his steed.Too bad no one told her Pestilence can’t be killed. Now the horseman, very much alive and very pissed off, has taken her prisoner, and he’s eager to make her suffer. Only, the longer she’s with him, the more uncertain she is about his true feelings towards her … and hers towards him. And now, well, Sara might still be able to save the world, but in order to do so, she'll have to sacrifice her heart in the process.

There are no typos. However, the author writes in Chapter 17 that the leading man, Pestilence, infects CHILDREN (two young kids, a boy and girl) with his PLAGUE and they die from his disease. By the way, Pestilence can stop and reverse his disease from infecting and killing humans. So he causes those kids to die and he was fine with that.It\'s horrific and sickening that the ""romantic"" leading man in this story deliberately murders a mom, dad and their two young kids. This scene was a deal breaker for me.I\'m not sorry for giving a one star.A paranormal horror like the Walking Dead is NOT a romance. This book is the same as the Walking Dead and it occupies the same genre of paranormal horror. This story is NOT a romance and the sex between Pestilence and the human chick is just a mockery of the children dying from the disease that Pestilence inflicts as genocide.Pestilence intentionally does genocide. Think about that.This book is no different than the horror genre. I can only feel deeply angry at Pestilence for murdering children. He isn\'t hot and desirable. Killing kids and their parents just makes him evil.\n\n', ""\n\n  *Spoilers*So Pestilence is a love story where two unlikely people end up falling in love, granted one is apart of the apocalypse and the other a regular human girl. There wasn't much to this story, they went to town Pestilence spread his plague. Sara begged him to stop, they got attacked. Basically that was about it. The story was kind of difficult to get through cause it was really boring and repetitive at times. I definitely prefer Laura's other series more.\n\n"", '\n\n  First, I want to start by saying I cried when starting this book when I realized it was a paranormal/fantasy book not only in Canada, but the MC is Canadian. I barely ever find any ""Canadian"" stories/books in this genre, and it\'s why I\'ve been writing my own for years now. And it was fantastic to read one so well-written.The story itself was very different from the usual genre; unique and new. I loved the MC and Pestilence, and although sometimes I wanted to shake them both until I got sense into both, they grew on me. Toward the middle-end part, it started dragging on a bit where I felt like some parts were getting a bit repetitive in what was happening, but this is the type of story that still pulls off the ""slow burn"" type of pace. In the end, I felt like I still had one big question that makes it more of a Happily Ever After for now, but not in a cliffhanger sort of way.Looking forward to more of this series!\n\n', ""\n\n  Loved this book. So much I could barely put it down to sleep, and I picked it right back up when I awoke. I love me some apocalyptic darkness, throw some romance and getting it on in between and I'm 100% satisfied. I've read some of the other reviews about the gruesomeness of the plague and I have to wonder, what were people expecting? This is Pestilence, the plague. Yes, children die during a plague. It's not pretty or romantic and it certainly doesn't do an about face the moment he sets eyes on a human bent on killing him. But the author does a convincing job detailing Pestilence's transformation. The baby steps it takes, the resistance and the fear involved in change. She does the same with Sara seeing through her own perceptions to really see Pestilence and what he's endured, not just what he was sent to do all while questioning her own existence and humanity.Looking forward to delving into the next book as well as her other series.\n\n"", ""\n\n  This book was not at all what I expected. The violence of the world was such an effective tool in the love story between Pestilence and Sara. I fully expected a primarily physical attraction, but this is an emotional growth love match. Their relationship begins with violence and intolerance and blooms into tenderness and empathy.I loved that it begins in Whistler, BC. When you know a setting well, it's easier to become immersed in the world and focus on the characters.My heart felt full at the end of this book, and I will be happy to continue the series. I'm hopeful that the author will continue to surprise me with the depth of her characters.\n\n"", '\n\n  I don\'t often write reviews but I found Pestilence to be a powerful story. I connected with Sara, the strong female main character. I also appreciate that she is Canadian. Bottom line...I had a very hard time setting my tablet aside and read well past when I should have gone to sleep. There were times when I found that I had tears rolling down my cheeks, the story was that compelling and the main characters have so many obstacles to overcome. If you don\'t like stories that create strong emotions, this book won\'t be for you.As for me, the only drawback is that (at the time that I\'m writing this review) this is a fairly new release and the other two books, War and an as yet unnamed third book, are not complete so I can\'t binge read this series! Fortunately Laura Thalassa has other books available and I\'ve started the first book of ""The Bargainer"" series. So far, so good! ;)\n\n', ""\n\n  Really enjoyed this book. I loved the MC's character developments + how much they both struggled with their inner dilemma of how they felt for one another even though they were mortal enemies. Lots of action, lots of violence + it certainly isn't for the faint of heart but this story is very very good. I did remove one star only because I thought the last few chapters before the epilogue dragged for me but damn, this book is highly entertaining + the characters just grow on you.\n\n"", ""\n\n  While this was a hesitant purchase on my part, it took a very long time to get into it. The characters were irritating for the majority of the book, but once they finally pushed for a relationship it was both amusing and slightly dramatic/comical. Only once their relationship was rolling did the kindle appeal more to me. 4 Stars goes towards the 2nd half of the book, where they work together and discover his plan isn't the right thing to do. Suffer through the start and you'll enjoy the rest.\n\n""]"

Great read\n\n', ""\n\n  Brilliant was this story, pure & simple was the romance, long held hidden affection and devotion, a need to protect and create a family.  This story was built on solid foundations and crept to amazing heights of hot erotic moments, forgiveness with warm & fuzzy family connections and action packed danger & mystery.They mystery of Olivia's unexplained threats to her life was I thought well entwined throughout the romantic storyline.  I loved the determination, inner strength and stubbornness of Olivia to create a life when obstacles are thrown at her and the military background was told in a thoughtful and respectful way.The emotion and strength expressed by Olivia made me absolutely love her and I wanted her and Ben to have their second chance at romance.The extended family and friends also provided a great source of humour and sentimental moments.I did not pick the dangerous connection in Olivia's life until the end and thought it was woven really well into the history of this group of family and friends.This is a fantastic read and its one of those stories I would pick up again.More reviews: www.romancebetweenthesheets.com\n\n"", '\n\n  Surprise!! That’s what you will get with this book. It was a war veteran, a friend’s sister, and a suspense story all rolled up in a book that was hard to put down. The love was heartwarming and the “who done it” was a bombshell. The author did a great job of giving me a strong female character in Olivia and with Ben she made him in to a guy that most people would love to have in their life. For me this definitely won’t be the last time I read this author. I can’t wait to see what’s next.I received this book as an ARC for a freely given and honest review.\n\n', ""\n\n  Title: WarriorAuthor: Nicole BlanchardSeries: First to Fight series, Book 1Publisher: Bolero BooksReviewer: KathleenRelease Date: September 5th, 2015Genre(s): Contemporary RomancePage Count:296 pagesHeat Level: 3.5 flames out of 5Rating: 4 stars out of 5Blurb:I thought it was just one night with my brother’s best friend.The boy I had dreamt about since he gave me my first kiss, under the lights of the Ferris wheel.I knew he was about to leave for a year – no chance for a future.But our one night together would create memories for a lifetime.Our paths crossed again, but I had lied, and he was no longer the man he once was. He was warring against demons. Against the silence that was threatening to swallow him. And I had kept a secret from him, one he would never forgive me for.But my secret was about to be ripped open. Displayed for the world on national news. And I had only one way to repair the damage.I had to trust the man I lied to.The man I never got the chance to make a life with.The only man who could save what we had created together.Review:There's something about the first boy that kisses you, that is your first experience and is your first love that you never forget. They will always be special and no matter how hard you try, you find yourself comparing the future lovers to the very first, wondering who was the best and never really able to come up with an answer. In Warrior, Olivia and Ben have known each other for years, Ben being Olivia's brother's best friend, but the more they spent time together, the more they couldn't deny their attraction and eventual love between each other. They knew they had one single night before Ben had to leave for a year on an overseas military tour. What neither ever expected was a gift left for them - a gift that Olivia has tried to tell Ben more than once that she had through email, but devastating circumstances forced him to simply delete each and every one of them without reading them. On his return, his demons follows him and Olivia's life is threatened: Ben can't sit idly by to watch her get hurt, and decides to be at her side, discovering the gift.As another novel appears containing a veteran who comes home and suffers from unimaginable nightmares and the worst kinds of injuries, I wondered how Nicole Blanchard would be able to make Warrior stand out from the pack and make itself known among its category. Then, when I kept reading, I found out why this author, who until now I hadn't read any of her books yet, had a novel that is full of emotion and shows the dark side of the effects of having to live through the horrors of a war zone and the way she can put so much details into one steamy scene that will surely make your heart pound or at the very least have you wanting to fan yourself. I've enjoyed watching Olivia and Ben's relationship evolve and my emotions went through the wringer as I 'sat' and read all the obstacles they had to go through to be able to be together once again. This is one novel that I'd recommend to readers who are looking for that one book that will have them going through a wide variety of emotions and that 'sigh' worthy ending.Review Copy of Warrior provided by the Author, Nicole Blanchard for an honest Review.Reviewed by Kathleen from Alpha Book Club\n\n""]"

I found all of the characters to be really immature, especially the lead male character. He came across as an entitled sixteen year old. I am also not a fan of wimpy female roles.Besides the lack of maturity in the characters was the lack of adequate editing, punctuation especially. And, the repetitiveness of the ""omg (s)he loves me, how can (s)he love me?"" Nearly every page!If you\'re going to write in first person, then understand how to do it. Who thinks to themselves, ""I need to talk to my father, Roger, today."" Don\'t you know who your father is, what his name is? We don\'t say our father\'s name when we\'re thinking about him because we already know it! That\'s just one of the many, many cases of mistakes like this. A good editor should have caught that, but more importantly, the author should never have made so many glaring errors like this.First book by this author, and will most likely be my last.\n\n', '\n\n  I am a fan.  I adored Mr. Masters and I’ve been hoping for this to turn into a series but I didn’t hear anything but luckily I happened across Mr. Spencer.  I didn’t even know it was out or coming out but happy I came across it.  I absolutely enjoyed reading this book.  I love the story between Spence and Charlotte.  It swayed and trickled slowly as they became more and more aware of their feelings.  Some unexpected turns.  This is TL Swan at her best.  My only criticism and one I’ve seen others also write is the bold for used for the H’s POV, in this case - Spence.  Many readers used the Bookely font in the US and Canada and the dark, extra large, bold type is so distracting and difficult to read that every time I read Spence’s POV I had to change it to the Caecila font just so I could read it. It distracted and annoyed me.  I hope the author considers this request.  Most authors just use a sub heading with the name of the POV - we are used to that but the dark bold font is incredibly difficult and hard on the eyes.  As for the story, well done - and I look forward to more. 😘\n\n', ""\n\n  It took me longer than normal to finish this book, because the drama these two main characters created in their relationship could only be read in small doses. They were both immature and their emotions swung from very hot to very cold at a moments notice. I ended by disliking them both so much. They deserved each other, and not in a good way.Another thing that drove me crazy was the extreme overuse of the verb ' smirk'. The author was also fond of describing characters as going on their tiptoes (for no apparent reason).The writing of the sex scenes was first rate,  but unfortunately it didn't outweigh the negatives in this novel.\n\n"", ""\n\n  Another wonderful book by TL Swan... Her perfect writing, it was so intense , all the twists, strong characters, deep feels, very good hot scenes, many funny moments too in the book, and the love between main characters is so awesome💕.... This is a must to be read for all the one who loves the best perfect romance book! TL Swan ticks all the boxes again with this book💏🎇🔥🙈🔥😢😭💔💞😂💓💕👏👏👏It can be read as a standalone.

I fell for Spencer right away. There is something truly endearing about this man that absolutely captivated me. There were times I shook my head but when it as all said and done Spencer was loving, kind and so damn sexy. He loved Charlotte with everything he had. The way he stood up for her and protected her at whatever cost. Even letting her go melted my heart. Charlotte was so swayed by the family she loved that she never thought her life could be her own. She just pleased and looked after everyone else except herself. Once she let herself feel things she never thought possible her whole world changed. She fell so hard for Spencer and was willing to give up everything for him. These two were meant for each other. They loved so deeply and protected each other with so much determination to beat all odds. This book was fantastic. The writing was stellar! I felt each character when they laughed, cried and loved so deeply. I cannot say enough about this book. So many feels. It had everything I loved in a book....5 stars doesn't feel like enough!\n\n"", '\n\n  What an emotional roller coaster TL Swan takes you on with each and every book she writes. Mr Spencer is just like it...one minute you’re pissed at him then you fall in love with him.  Such talent  that I could not put this book down.  Can hardly wait fir the next book she writes.

I fell in love with the craziness of Spencer Jones in book 1, but in this book his zaniness sealed the deal for me. Charlotte was adorable. They are so well suited for each other. I especially loved how supportive and encouraging he was of her, especially to her family.

Although better to read in order and all characters connected, this can be read as stand alone. However for better enjoyment, I suggest to read in order as the epilogue of this book close the circle.Each book starred a brother. 4 kids who were saved by a man. 4 kids who were not brothers by blood but became brothers because of this man.Last book, hawk storie is very emotional. It is about recovery a terrible childhood and domestic violence and rape. From a man point of view (POV), from a woman POV and from a kid POV… Heavy topic to include in a romance, yet you can be very much insured that the author was very sensitive and kept all precautions to develop her story with anything that could trigger some of you, I personally didn’t read any gory or horrible details. It is written with a profound respect and knowledge. It is referred but never fully describedThis story is of course romanced but it is also a message of hope. That’s how I feel after reading it.This said, as usual, I found myself smiling, crying, teary, dreaming all long my reading. Cherise Sinclair is extraordinary to bring a wagon of emotions. It is a long book and I love her for it. Each chapter is a slice of everyday life, knowing, understanding, sharing characters life, love and struggles. And more.More because Cherise Sinclair always add a solid plot in between. It doesn’t overpower the love story but it add something in the story.Plus, she added kids. And like real life she added an adorable 4 years old kid who will find a happy ending.The 4 books that compose this series are just best buddies romances you want to read and re-read. Even writing this review, I still have this smile on my face from the pleasure this author gives me… every single time. There is no BDSM whatever in this series. Just contemporary with ex army guys who fell hard for their woman (and kids).The sad part is that now I will have to wait few months for the next book to be published. Cherise Sinclair is a great author and an automatic read.\n\n', '\n\n  Well, that took me on a wild ride that had my heart pumping and my adrenaline spiking! Then it had my heart melting and happy tears welling as the legacy of Mako settled in deep. This is Hawk’s story, the most closed off of the men. The one who doesn’t think much of himself because life has taught him that, and then reinforced it, from the very beginning. The man who is a part of something, yet still feels detached. The one who started out with baggage and still carries it. This is also the story of Kit and Aric. They have been damaged and traumatized. Abused and belittled and learned to stay off the radar because of that. Catalysts for the change that is coming over their lives, and in danger because of that. These three will invade your heart, make is sing, make is hurt, make it swell, and make it contract. As they work through what is part of them, they learn to rely on each other, become part of each others lives, and they learn to love themselves, and thus, each other. This is a family forming, part of it intact and strong, another part just having those first tendrils reaching out. This is a man and a woman figuring out how to re-learn reactions and learning about each other while doing so. It isn’t an easy path for any of them, but the results of their efforts are all the more beautiful because of it. I simply loved this book, the characters in this series, and this amazing conclusion to it all <3\n\n', '\n\n  Amazing story that i am sad is over!!  I love how these 4 foster brothers are able to rise above everything and find a family amongst themselves and find true love to boot!! Lots of drama, some abuse but in the end there is always love and this amazing couple Hawk and Kit find their HEA!!  Go grab this series and enjoy this fabulous ride!!

I\'d recommend it to anyone, even if you\'re only 16 in high school, you will not look back. It\'s written in a way that is incredibly easy to understand, which is effective in my opinion for reaching more people who may be apprehensive about this area of finance.

The backstory took over this read and it felt like I was biting at the bit and yelling at the author to say ‘let’s worry about now!” I can admit to bring a sensitive reader who likes dark stories but this story really hit hard.  The angst took up much of the story it was hard to catch your breath and I still felt a bit raw after I finished. While I appreciate the backstory,  the part angst plays, this felt too much and I had to continually put it down. I wish more time have been spent on the current story, and Simone and Dante coming together as parents. It felt like he forgave her so fast it wasn’t real. I also had more questions then answers about Simone’s father and what part he played in their separation, in the end her parents are basically forgotten.

His cool head and detachment had served him well during his military career; then later with matters pertaining to both branches of the Gallo family business.  I was quite surprised then to discover the depth of the emotional and soul-deep connection he shared with Simone when they were 21 and 18 respectively.  Simone was a sweet, kind and dutiful daughter, raised in an affluent family by parents who had mapped out all aspects of her life.  I was glad when she finally stood up for herself, expressing her opinions and her desires.This well written romantic suspense is told through dual POV’s during the period when the H&h first meet, and when they reconnect, nine years later.  I didn’t find the romance particularly dark – at least not when they first met, but there were definitely some darker undertones to their explicit encounters once reunited.  There’s plenty of drama, conflict, angst, suspense, plus some betrayal, danger and violence.  It was fun seeing Dante’s siblings – Aida, Seb and Nero, as pre-teens/teens as they interacted with Dante and Simone.I received a free copy of this book via Booksprout and am voluntarily leaving a review.\n\n', ""\n\n  This is book four in the Brutal Birthright series.

Nine years later, Fate has a cruel plan to bring these two miserable souls back into each others space. So much has changed but the love that started nine years ago has not been lost but just went temporarily dormant. However, the road to HEA is not paved in gold or on the straight and narrow.

" The Minimalist Budget: A Practical Guide On How To Save Money, Spend Less And Live More With A Minimalist Lifestyle ",['Simeon Lindstrom'], CDN$ 5.16 ,1,  Best Sellers Rank:  #406 in Kindle Store (See Top 100 in Kindle Store)   #1 in Budgeting & Money Management (Kindle Store)  #6 in Budgeting & Money Management (Books)  ,4.0 out of 5 stars,284 ratings,"
  “Budget"" - it's a meager little word, one that all too often comes after “tight”...Maybe you think of this word as an adjective, something to describe a cheap and substandard car or hotel. “Budget” brings to mind rationing, a kind of money diet. If you're like many people, budgeting is something you do with a kind of deflated spirit: budgeting means bargain bin quality and the sad sense that what you want is going to be just out of reach.This book will try a different approach to budgeting altogether...This book will offer an expanded notion of what it means to budget. We'll look at how money is not the only resource that needs to be managed, and a “life budget” that acknowledges your emotional, behavioral, social and even spiritual capital is more likely to lead to smarter decisions.We'll explore shopping and spending habits, identify problem areas, think about debt and make achievable goals for home, work and more. We'll look at concrete ways to put some of these principles into action, and look at resources that will keep you focused and motivated. At the same time, this book is also about the philosophy of minimalism, not thriftiness. If you can pair your budget plan with a more nuanced understanding of your relationship with money and how it ties into how you want to live, the changes you make will be more authentic and longer lasting.Minimalism is not about doing with less than you need. Rather, it's about finding what you need and fulfilling that need exactly, without excess. It's a subtle and easily overlooked point: to have exactly enough is not suffering. Budgeting is therefore about understanding what you need to have enough, and how best you can allocate your resources to that end.Life is short. Money and material things can make our time on this earth better, and they can help us move closer to what we find meaningful and worthwhile. But they are not meaningful and worthwhile in themselves. Money is a tool and how we spend it is an expression of our values and what we think is important. How much would you pay for peace of mind and the calm you get from knowing you are living well? How much of your life do you give away when you work? Of all your expenses, have you remembered to include the time you waste stressing about money?These may seem like vague or overly philosophical questions, but they get to the root of how we earn, spend and think of money. Once we understand these roots, our efforts to save here and there not only become easier, they become more meaningful.

They are learning a bit more about each other but they are keeping a lot of secrets. Secrets of that could potentially blow up and change everything.

  From USA Today bestselling author and the author of The Highland Fling, comes a brand new hockey romance about a wayward traveler falling in love with her ex-boyfriend's half-brother. Steamy and unapologetically witty. Five hockey players, a cabin in the woods . . . and little old me, Winnie Berlin.Sounds like the start of a fantasy, right? But it's not. It's my reality.It all started when I got lost in the middle of the Canadian Rockies. A wicked thunderstorm sent my car mud sliding into a ditch and for a girl whose survival skills involve finding the nearest Starbucks, I was in deep trouble.Forced to abandon my car in search of help, I stumbled upon a cabin in the middle of nowhere. Soaking wet, irritated, and in desperate need of a hot shower, I knocked on the door for help only to be greeted by five boisterous, burly, and insanely attractive men.Not just men.Professional hockey players.I hit the motherload of fantasies, right? Wrong.Because as it turns out, one of them is my ex-boyfriend's half-brother. And when I end up crashing in their spare bedroom for the night, things take a very unexpected turn.I'm not sure any amount of survival skills can protect my heart from Vancouver Agitators star goalie, Pacey Lawes. But as long as we kiss and don’t tell, maybe everything will be okay . . .

There was one scene that really bothered my ethics, but I’m going to give it a relative pass because the author did make a point of saying something along the lines of, “I know that this would seem absolutely insane under most circumstances, but…” She then went on to explain. I still found the action wrong, but I can sort of see how she justified it.  Almost.Aside from that one scene and reasonably small storyline, I found this book charming. Both Pacey and Winnie were great characters, flawed but endearing and relatable. The supporting characters were also a hoot. I really hope the rest of the agitators get their own stories.\n\n', ""\n\n  I loved Winnie and Pacey. And the rest of the crew.I mean a girl stumbles upon a cabin full of 5 hunky hockey players - what a set up THAT could have been.But instead, we get Winnie and Pacey and their immediate chemistry.

I really hope Meghan does a series on the boys from Vancouver\n\n"", ""\n\n  I loved this book, like the rest of Meghan's. I cried, I laughed SO much. Pacey is one of my favourite leading men from Meghan. Such a good story, you won't be disappointed.\n\n"", ""\n\n  Kiss and Don't Tell by Meghan Quinn is a hockey-related rom-com.For hockey player Pacey Lawes, relaxing in the cabin, with his closest friends, is the perfect way to unwind after a long season, however poor Winnie shows up and revs everyone up.I love how Meghan writes, she pulls you in, and makes you fully committed, heart and soul, to these characters. I fall for them every time, and Pacey and Winnie are no different. They are both so kind, and caring, both goofy and quirky. It's easy to laugh and smile right along through this book.\n\n"", '\n\n  Pacey & Winnie were everything I needed. The story grabbed me from Chapter 1 and wouldn\'t let me go.Meghan Quinn always has a way with banter and joking, but take 5 massive professional hockey players, jam them into a ""cabin"" in the woods outside Banff and watch the ribbing ensue. These guys are teammates and friends. They know each other\'s buttons to push and it\'s hilarious to watch (or listen) to it happen. Throw a stranded damsel into the mix and it\'s perfection.Pacey and Winnie each find the other familiar in some way from their first meeting even though they don\'t know each other at all. Winnie isn\'t a hockey fan (her BFF Max confirms the OMG factor of her new friends) so even though the house is full of famous athletes, she doesn\'t know them from a murderer in the woods. Again, we get lots of amusement, laughter and some alarmingly paranoid personal safety lectures (that\'s the other BFF Katherine chiming in).Pacey (with help from the other guys) convinces Winnie to stay at the house while she\'s in town and the swoon worthy super fast romance that comes out of it is just incredible. But when they have to go back to the real world, will all the other pressures and anxieties invade their bubble? When a few secrets that were held back come to light will it change things?The answer is always yes, but with all the talent that is Meghan Quinn, she rips out your heart right along with the characters and squishes it, but always reassembles it better than ever for the HEA. The road to get there isn\'t easy (is it ever?), but it\'s so worth it.The Audiobook for this story was performed impeccably by Jason Clarke and Vanessa Edwin. The emotional highs and lows for Pacey along with all the guys, so good. It\'s hard to listen to a conversation between 6-7 males and be able to keep them all separate but Jason does a great job giving each guy their signature. Vanessa presents the awesomeness that is a BFF facetime convo with perfect comedic timing and vocal range (Katherine & Max make me giggle so much). Vanessa also brings Winnie\'s emotional range to life, highs, lows and all the laughter in between, she just makes me feel it all.\n\n', '\n\n  I loved this book! It had a lot of humor, some heat but mostly heart. Winnie and Pacey are great together, and their meet cute was the best part.Winnie goes on an adventure in Banff when her car gets stuck and she stumbles upon a house with five professional hockey players. Pacey makes sure to protect Winnie and boosts her confidence after her previous relationship ended badly. He was very sweet and a great book boyfriend. I am looking forward to the rest of the boys getting their books!\n\n', ""\n\n  Another sweet and funny rom-com from Meghan Quinn! Winnie and Pacey are absolutely adorable. Their path to HEA hits a snag or two but rest assured they get there. You really can't go wrong with anything Quinn writes!⭐⭐⭐⭐\n\n""]"

  “Huxley’s final word about the human condition and the possibility of the good society. . . . Island is a welcome and in many ways unique addition to the select company of books—from Plato to now—that have presented, in imaginary terms, a coherent view of what society is not but might be.”  — New York Times Book ReviewThe final novel from Aldous Huxley, Island is a provocative counterpoint to his worldwide classic Brave New World, in which a flourishing, ideal society located on a remote Pacific island attracts the envy of the outside world.In the novel Huxley considered his most important, he transports us to the remote Pacific island of Pala, where an ideal society has flourished for 120 years. Inevitably, this island of bliss attracts the envy and enmity of the surrounding world. A conspiracy is underway to take over Pala, and events are set in motion when an agent of the conspirators, a newspaperman named Faranby, is shipwrecked there. What Faranby doesn't expect is how his time with the people of Pala will revolutionize all his values and—to his amazement—give him hope.

What a creative and brilliant thinker and writer! I decided to re-read it just recently and was blown away with how his ideas would still be useful to our world in the areas of how to run a society economically and politically - and how to educated people so they can reach their full potential. I honestly thought that our North American societies would have progressed more in the past sixty years, especially with the benefit of brilliant authors like Huxley showing the way - but it seems that the disease of addiction to money and power which he portrays in the book has continued to guide the direction of our world... The consumer society accelerated after WW2 and we are swept up in it.  We need more visionaries like Aldous Huxley. I would strongly recommend reading this book for the first and or second time...\n\n"", ""\n\n  It's the best one.\n\n"", ""\n\n  One of huxley's  lesser known project's.Utopian rather than dystopian.\n\n"", '\n\n  Good story about life expectations and real needs.\n\n', '\n\n  i learned a lot by reading this book\n\n', '\n\n  Huxley crafts an absorbing tale.

This is Aldous Huxley\'s utopian vision to contrast with his dystopian\xa0\n\nBrave New World\n\n  . ""Island"" was written much later in Huxley\'s life and reflects his interest in Eastern philosophies and his concern about the corruption and exploitation that the Third World suffered from both the West and the Communist Bloc.Huxley hit the nail on the head when he spoke through one of Pala\'s citizens:""Armaments, universal debt, and planned obsolescence - those are the three pillars of Western prosperity. If war, waste, and moneylenders were abolished, you\'d collapse.""This quote from ""Island"" is just as damning an indictment of consumerism now as it was when Huxley\'s novel was published in 1962, if not more so. Huxley was trying to tell us that there is more to life than buying things and being envious of those who have more toys than we do; he was exploring what it really means to be Human. It\'s a very well-written book that is very easy to lose oneself in, so ""Attention!"" (read the book and you\'ll understand that ;) and join Will Farnaby as he explores Pala and, in the process, himself.\n\n']"

  All Vanessa Williams wanted for the holidays was to escape the demands of her parents’ social schedules and comfortable place to work on her book. Having the opportunity to do so while enjoying the comforts of a cabin on an alien world seemed like the perfect way to pass the season. Plans change, however, when her shuttle crashes in the inhospitable mountains, and she finds herself waiting out the storm in an alien castle with a male whose burning gold eyes promise forbidden pleasures. Mating with an alien would be the ruin of her career and guarantee that she can never go home, and yet the more time she spends with him, the more she can’t imagine any other future.Jor’ytal has waited many revolutions to feel the call of the a’talynal, the heartsong between himself and a compatible female. That it has happened so close to the Hashavnal, the Day of Joy, feels like destiny calling.

With the storms keeping her within his estate it is the perfect opportunity to court his mate, even if he must evade her escort to do so. In mixing the human customs of Solstice with Hashavnal, and a solstice tree that goes terribly wrong, he is on the path to win her heart and not even a human delegation whose very presence can steal her away will deter him.This novel contains a bonus 14.5k short story Aturian Gifts of Yule  Read more  ",[],[],[]

The battle of wills, desires, and needs leads to some comical moments, while at the same time highlights just how well these two fit together.  Cara’s abilities really make her shine as a character, as does her compassion and genuine warmth.  Her difficult past directly affects her, yet doesn’t define her.  Talen’s multifaceted character was fantastic.  I enjoyed getting to know him bit by bit via tidbits dropped by those closest to him.  He was also hot, caring, and all Alpha, the type of hero you just can’t look away from.  And let’s not forget Janie, in all her cuteness & insight.  Through her we get to know a lot about the hearts of the main characters, as well as many of the supporting cast.My final thoughts on this one?  How have I never read this novel before now & could someone please hand me the next in the series.

After all this isn't the edge of the solar system or even the galaxy but the universe so it should be huge.

That\'s for sure it\'s written in a way you can not put it down until it is finished!!!!💕🔥🙈🔥🔥😭😂 Brielle is my favorite character of all the books i have read in my life and she sets the bar high for following to surpass her!!!

I loved the (h) character Bree. She was silly, over the top but loved and protected fiercely.  She was a bright ray of sunshine.  If I could, I would give this book 9 stars, deleting one star for the typos (which is never acceptable) and the format issues. This story keeps you engaged.  You have Bree, a fun spirited, smart, beautiful and loyal woman whi is honest to a fault and shoots from the hip.  The things that come out of her mouth made me fall of my treadmill for laughing so hard.  I smiled and laughed throughout and Julian, an older, cross, closed off, Atype who has a sweet heart but is so broken due to a tragedy in his past he can’t let anyone in the slightest bit.

  Captivating and action-packed, From Blood and Ash is a sexy, addictive, and unexpected fantasy perfect for fans of Sarah J. Maas and Laura Thalassa.A Maiden…Chosen from birth to usher in a new era, Poppy’s life has never been her own. The life of the Maiden is solitary. Never to be touched. Never to be looked upon. Never to be spoken to. Never to experience pleasure. Waiting for the day of her Ascension, she would rather be with the guards, fighting back the evil that took her family, than preparing to be found worthy by the gods. But the choice has never been hers.A Duty…The entire kingdom’s future rests on Poppy’s shoulders, something she’s not even quite sure she wants for herself. Because a Maiden has a heart. And a soul. And longing. And when Hawke, a golden-eyed guard honor bound to ensure her Ascension, enters her life, destiny and duty become tangled with desire and need. He incites her anger, makes her question everything she believes in, and tempts her with the forbidden.A Kingdom…Forsaken by the gods and feared by mortals, a fallen kingdom is rising once more, determined to take back what they believe is theirs through violence and vengeance. And as the shadow of those cursed draws closer, the line between what is forbidden and what is right becomes blurred. Poppy is not only on the verge of losing her heart and being found unworthy by the gods, but also her life when every blood-soaked thread that holds her world together begins to unravel.Reviews for From Blood and Ash:""Dreamy, twisty, steamy escapism.

Armentrout’s books are always a must buy. I have never been disappointed and when I got the chance to get my hands on From Blood and Ash, I swear I jumped on the occasion to find out how I was going to enjoy her writing into this genre.Let me tell you that this author comes through once again with From Blood and Ash as it kept me enthralled throughout the whole book. You won't be able to put down this epic story once you start. This book has everything you didn’t know you needed in a book. I swear I had difficulties to put it down when I needed to work. I needed to know more and more.Poppy is an incredible character. She is the Maiden; the Chosen. All of her life, she has been treated differently because of it by the few people who get to see her. She has a long list of things she can’t do, but Poppy is also kind of like a rule breaker which makes her more interesting. Throughout the book, you see how she’s fighting to find herself, but still trying to remain true to what people are expecting from her, but as the book progress so many events will be putting her faith to the test. She has a strong personality and she has such endurance to everything she had to go through. I loved how she was portrayed in this book and I’m looking forward to see how much growth she will do in the next books to come.Next is Hawke who is an intriguing character from the moment you are first introduced to him. He is cocky and sure of himself, but he also has a way that makes him seem like he connects with the people he talks to. There is an aura of mystery around him which only wants you to get to know him more. His character pulls you in and you just take anything that he’s giving you.Poppy and Hawke’s chemistry is over the chart and when they are together, you just feel it in everything they do or say. Throughout the book, the two will banter and he really likes to tease her and this just adds more to the chemistry between them. Hawke will be a major factor in Poppy’s search to find herself. He will bring a lot of feelings she hadn’t really had the chance to feel before and it will bring so much more question about what she is expected to do and what she actually wants.So many characters in this book that you will either love, hate or perhaps be confuse about them, but one thing is for sure; none of them will leave you indifferent. Whether you care for them or simply want them gone, they will all make you feel something.The story itself is filled with a lot of this world’s history, its secrets and as truths start to be revealed, the characters will have to debate about where they actually stand in this battle between two clans and whether or not they had been right or wrong about what they knew.I swear this review is hard to write because I could say so much, but spoilers will be said and I want you guys to see for yourself just how awesome this book was. I wanted to re-read this book over and over again once I was done with it. Jennifer L. Armentrout knows what her readers love and she has put up an interesting list of characters, of events and secrets that will captivate you throughout the whole book.Honestly, you need to grab that book right now because it is one amazing read and I can't contain my excitement for the next book to come.\n\n"", '\n\n  This books was exactly what I needed right now and everything I didn’t know I wanted.It was filled with intrigue, mystery, deception and lies.  There are maidens and “prophecies”.  There are shape shifters and the undead.  The female lead is sassy and badass.  The male lead is handsome, dark, and oh so mysterious.  And let’s not forget the unforgettable ANGST!!.Poppy and Hawks story took me by storm and I could not put them down.  Even days after finishing, I am still thinking about them.Honestly, this story had everything I love and the writing was absolutely impeccable.I cannot wait to get my hands on book two, A Kingdom of Flesh and Fire!!READ. THIS. BOOK.This is my first book by this author and I can guarantee you that I will be stalking her back catalogue ASAP!!\n\n', ""\n\n  4.5 Stars“With my sword and with my life, I vow to keep you safe, Penellaphe,” he spoke, voice deep and smooth, reminding me of rich, decadent chocolate. “From this moment until the last moment, I am yours.”From Blood and Ash is the first book I’ve ever read by Jennifer L Armentrout and is definitely not the last as I vow to read the rest of her books because I’m definitely missing out!The story follows Poppy, a Maiden living a guarded life not because she wanted to but because that’s how she was raised. Given a huge responsibility that is connected with the next generation, Poppy never had a choice until the arrival of the new guard, Hawke.The world building was so detailed in this first book of the Blood and Ash series that made me pause and backtrack to analyze what was being described. There was a lot of information in the first half of the book that could be missed easily. I felt that the author’s intention was to build a complex world and to confuse the readers with regards to the plot.Written in Poppy’s point of view, there were instances that I felt frustrated because it wasn't easy to relate to her guarded and innocent mind. Reading from her perspective needs some getting used to but I understand why the author chose to have it that way, I believe it was necessary for the reader’s journey to properly understand where Poppy is coming from and for the sake of the secrets that will be unraveled.The choice of words used were perfect and I must say that JLA can write romance so so so well that it was easy to get lost in the world of From Blood and Ash.Although I had difficulty reading this at first because of some disturbing scenes (sexual harassment), I ended up loving From Blood and Ash and would highly recommend this to any fans of paranormal romance. There’s a lot of intense and sexy scenes that is highly addictive.\n\n"", ""\n\n  I. love. this. book.It was my first Jennifer L. Armentrout book, so I wasn't aware of any of her previous storylines (now that I read a couple of her other books, I do see a lot of overlap).When I first started the book, I didn't think that I would like it. The writing wasn't quite there, and with the Sarah J. Maas comparison I had high expectations. But then, at about 20% in it really started to pick up - definitely give it a chance! The main character really is a heroine and kicks ass.\n\n""]"

She finds herself in need of cash so Reed offers her a job – to watch his nephew while he\'s on the ice at away games. The attraction and tension between the two runs hot when they get in close proximity, so they make a deal to keep their hearts intact.

The way he idolizes and worships Holland & her body is enough to make you a puddle of goo on the floor. The growth in him and his raw, genuine soul will have you swooning SO hard – I am OBSESSED with Reed Davidson. I loved the forbidden hints to this story. It is, hands down my FAVOURITE (so far) by Maren Moore, and I cannot wait for the rest of this series!""𝙄𝙩\'𝙨 𝙩𝙝𝙚 𝙟𝙤𝙪𝙧𝙣𝙚𝙮, 𝙣𝙤𝙩 𝙩𝙝𝙚 𝙧𝙖𝙘𝙚.""\n\n', '\n\n  I thought that this book was great. Reed was a stunning example of how a playboy can still be a down to earth, honest, caring man with solid scruples and priorities. I love the way that he transformed into a more wholesome and responsible version of himself when unforeseen circumstances forced him to take on the “dad” role.Holland was also a lovely character who I feel complemented Reed very well. There was nothing about Holland’s character that bothered me in any way, but she paled in comparison to Reed. For me, at least.I don’t think there was anything about this book that stood out so much that I will choose to reread it, but I thought it was a very good and enjoyable read. I gave it five stars instead of four because I feel like it merits more than its current 4.2 out of 5 stars rating.This was my first book by this author, but I enjoyed her style enough that I will seek out others.\n\n']"

She tries to help him, but after a few sessions he commits suicide.Not a good look for a psychologist with a new job.Needless to say, Dr. Dot Meyerhoff, newly minted police psychologist, is not only sad, she’s mortified. She’s already discovered counseling cops isn’t easy — that they’re uncommunicative men contemptuous of therapy.But she didn’t expect to fail quite this badly.Freshly divorced and in need of cash, she took the job even though she wasn’t quite prepared for it — especially for the irascible police chief, and the lack of respect throughout the department. Now she’s in danger of losing both the job and her license.Because when a client commits suicide, people tend to blame the therapist. Including Dot herself. She’s beating herself up because she didn’t prevent it. But could she have?She’s desperate to find out, and her quest takes her all over the small California town in which she finds herself. Luckily for the reader, sordid secrets spill out of closets in every neighborhood she visits.For readers, Dot’s unconventional investigation strikes a balance between the intrigue of a page turner and the empathy of a satisfying talk with a beloved friend.Best selling author Shane Gericke said, ""…. a heroine you'd want as a friend, and a tale so gripping it will keep you up at night.… cop fiction with soul.""Fans of Jonathan Kellerman will empathize with Dot’s plight, as well as devotees of Stephen White, Val McDermid, and Abigail Padgett— in fact, anyone who enjoys looking inside the minds of psychologists, as well as those who are looking for a good old-fashioned traditional mystery will love this low-key, thoughtful series.""A deftly crafted novel of compelling complexity…an absorbing read.

She remains hopeful a customer will soon choose her, but when the possibility emerges that her circumstances may change forever, Klara is warned not to invest too much in the promises of humans. In Klara and the Sun, Kazuo Ishiguro looks at our rapidly changing modern world through the eyes of an unforgettable narrator to explore a fundamental question: what does it mean to love?

I'm in the position of opposing the popularity of Ishiguro's novel Klara. I had SO looked forward to reading it! But it falls short of my expectations. I'm caught up in the beginning and immediately LIKE the narrator who is a robot, but as the novel progresses, I am more and more bored by the extensive dialogue. I skimmed the last 1/4 of the novel. I am a devoted re-reader of complex novels, but not this too-simple one! I'd NEVER read it again.\n\n"", '\n\n  I disliked the glacial first third but found little changed As it wore on. The author claimed in interviews that he had spoken to AI gurus but he seems to have gleaned one idea (robots seeing through geometric shapes) and he must have used this about twenty times. The device of the main character not being able to grasp pronouns is also frustrating. But there is nothing or no one to follow in any depth. The main human becomes inexplicably ill and then recovers.Very few novelists have been able to make futuristic writing interesting in a sustained way. Doris Lessing was bad and Ray Bradbury really innovative and fascinating.But this book will waste your time if you are interested in A.I.; more so if you like character development.\n\n', '\n\n  The writing style is so dull, formulaic and unrefined that makes for a very annoying reading.  The treatment of this important theme seem so childish and simplistic, nothing like the brilliant Machines Like Us by Ian McEwan. It is the second novel by Kazuo Ishiguro that disappoints me greatly. Too bad.\n\n', '\n\n  I never thought that I would become emotionally attached to a robot; but the author does a good job at humanizing Klara in an innocent and touching way - thus I want her to succeed.  I really enjoyed this book.I am currently enjoying another book by Kazuo Ishiguro called Never Let Me Go.  I also downloaded The Remains of the Day.  I think I have found a new author to follow.\n\n', ""\n\n  I liked how the novel gives the reader a fresh new look at artificial intelligence from a different perspective. I found it to be very thought provoking. I felt emotionally attached to the central character, though only a machine. Of course, there's a lot more to it than that, and the book really speaks to human behaviour.You'll enjoy this book if you are interested in thinking about some of the possibilities that could come from humans and androids intermingling.I gave it a 5 because I felt it was very well written and kept my interest throughout. Gobbled it up.\n\n"", '\n\n  A touching story told by an android. We see through her eyes some of the common humans stories: Love, divorce, greed, anger, strong beliefs in unlikely superstition and finally death or, at least, the road to death. Ishiguro paints vivid and real pictures the possible journeys that we all might take and the relationships along the way. His writing is beautiful and simple; touching and colourful.\n\n', '\n\n  Klara has the same sadness as Remains of the Day and Never Let Me Go. Gracefully decline without complaint for the wonderfully developed main character. Excellent.\n\n', '\n\n  Product arrived safe and sound and was as good as expected.  Betraying all this is the fact that it took no less than three weeks after order date until it appeared on my door step.

  Deep in the Amazon lies the solution to the global energy crisis - a mysterious source of power that will end our dependency on oil. It's not the only discovery. When entomologist Rebecca Riley receives a series of strange photographs from expedition leader and former partner, Ed Reardon, she finds herself heading to Brazil to join the team of scientists assembling there. She hasn't seen Ed for more than a year, and their relationship hadn't ended well. But his revelation is impossible to ignore. What she uncovers is beyond imagination: strange statues in the jungle... a ruined city built by the refugees of a lost Pacific continent... and a terrifying new species. She knows this is no ordinary animal. When the team is attacked, the mission becomes a desperate race for survival, and Rebecca must confront a crippling childhood phobia she'd thought long dead and buried. An ancient enemy has awakened, one whose very existence has implications for all of humankind... and the planet itself. TERROR HAS A NEW SPECIES. Reviewers are loving the action and scares of EIGHT: ""A wild roller coaster-ride-from-hell that keeps you guessing to the very end.""Knockin' Books ""Wow!

Ancient civilizations, giant spiders (megarachnids!), terrorist commandos, seal teams, alien technologies, bullets flying helos crashing people dying: it’s got it all but it’s not credible, it’s risible.  I am reminded of a line from ‘Calvin and Hobbes’ “Just then a horde of Nazi frogmen broke in”.  If it were a paperback, I would have thrown it across the room: not a good idea with an e-reader.

  INTERNATIONAL BESTSELLER In Silverview, John le Carré turns his focus to the world that occupied his writing for the past sixty years—the secret world itself.Julian Lawndsley has renounced his high-flying job in the City for a simpler life running a bookshop in a small English seaside town. But only a couple of months into his new career, Julian’s evening is disrupted by a visitor. Edward, a Polish émigré living in Silverview, the big house on the edge of town, seems to know a lot about Julian’s family and is rather too interested in the inner workings of his modest new enterprise. When a letter turns up at the door of a spy chief in London warning him of a dangerous leak, the investigations lead him to this quiet town by the sea . . . Silverview is the mesmerizing story of an encounter between innocence and experience and between public duty and private morals. In this last complete masterwork from the greatest chronicler of our age, John le Carré asks what you owe to your country when you no longer recognize it.

Overcome any suspicion you might possess towards posthumous publications. This novel was fully written before le Carré’s passing at the end of 2020. His younger son wonders why it had not been published, before offering an explanation of his own as an afterword to the book, which I’ll not share here, as you can have an equally speculative hypothesis of your own. For me, a fan of le Carré, this was one last gift from the revered writer of the spy genre. It is a short novel, which once it gathers pace becomes hard to put down. Sentimentality and nostalgia are not required, as this is a story that stands on its own feet, with as worthy characters and plot as the author always delivered.  So, set aside the time, pick your favourite reading spot and beverage, and enjoy.\n\n', '\n\n  I\'m being generous in giving ""Silverview"" a 3-star rating, but I\'m giving it only out of deep respect and admiration for le Carre. As a lifelong reader and re-reader of le Carre, this last novel reminded me more of Agatha Christie than one of the greatest novelists of the 20th century. I have immediately started a reading project to revisit all my other le Carre favourites, knowing I will not be disappointed, just transported and  enchanted.\n\n', ""\n\n  Full disclosure - I own at least one copy of everything ever written by John LeCarre (David Cornwell). I knew it couldn't go on forever and was saddened to hear of his passing. The posthumous release of this novel was very welcome even though I approached it with some trepidation - my experience of novels purporting to be by other well-loved authors after their deaths has been less than stellar. This one clearly was written, in the main, by the genuine author. I found it consistent with his style and comforting as an old blanket to snuggle into. If it is the last we will see of him, it is a fine bookend to a great career that I am grateful to have shared.\n\n"", '\n\n  This is a brilliant close to a series of novels that began with ""Call from the Dead"" in 1961.  Interestingly, while Smiley is long gone, as are many other familiar characters, certain of Le Carre\'s characteristics remain.  For instance, where ""Call..."" swivelled about postal cards, ""Silverview"" depends upon several (sealed) letters.  Highly recommended to readers of earlier Le Carre\'s or novels in general.  Ave atque vale!\n\n', '\n\n  This is not a typical Care book. In fact, when it was finished, I wondered if it had not fully loaded to my Kindle device, it was so short and lacking the length, mystery and suspense I was expecting. While the content may be of significance to families of individuals in intelligence services,  and have an interesting take on that life,  it was not what I had expected based on the past work of the author and the price. There may have been a reason why the  author did not publish this book himself.\n\n', '\n\n  You need to be a real John Le Carre fan to enjoy this novel. It has that jump all over writing with characters the reader tries to fit into the puzzle. One sees how end of career spies are treated. I bought it because it was his last novel, but am not a true fan.\n\n', '\n\n  The sadness of Le Carre’s death for the reader comes home keenly as you finish this book. I am jealous of those of you who have not read all his books. The joy of reading this book is certainly solace.\n\n', ""\n\n  Disappointing, but before you read the novel, read LeCarre's son's section at the end. In this tale the circus is in some disarray and all is not well therein.\n\n""]"

  Two thousand years ago, Jesus Christ met face-to-face with people just like you. Broken, imperfect, sometimes fearful and without hope. The Day I Met Jesus is a beautifully crafted narrative that chronicles the remarkable encounters of five women in the Gospels who were desperate to find wholeness, security, and purpose. Like all of us, these women struggled with the regrets of their pasts, the stresses of their presents, and the worries of their tomorrows.Join Frank Viola and Mary DeMuth on a fascinating journey back in time as they retell the dramatic accounts of five women who met Jesus. Each narrative is told from each woman's unique perspective, yet tightly grounded in the Gospel accounts and faithful to first-century history. Elegantly written and profoundly stirring, this book blends creative narrative with uncommon insight, spiritual depth, and practical application.If you are someone who seeks a renewal of hope, faith, and love, The Day I Met Jesus will make your Bible come to life and usher you into a fresh encounter with your Lord.

That’s exactly what you can count on throughout The Day I Met Jesus. The authors transport you into the first century latched onto stories of five broken women and their encounter with the Lord of healing, redemption. and grace.Your journey takes off with biblical narratives written as diary entries from an adulteress caught in the act, prostitute who loved extravagantly, multiple divorcée currently living in sin, defiled, isolated patient with an incessant flow of blood, and a friend who was one of Jesus’s much-loved disciples.Each one masterfully prepares the scene where we get to live in their skin; see things though their eyes, feel what they felt. Their first-person account brings you to a better understanding of who they were and what their lives must have been like. Each word pointing to that moment in time that changed everything, setting the stage for us to eavesdrop on their transforming encounter with Jesus. Words that paint, in living colour, what it means to be loved, forgiven, restored, healed. As we slip into their shoes, we detect footprints of someone we know much like them and catch glimpses of ourselves. Their stories, though experienced long ago, contain a timeless universality that seamlessly joins past events to present relevance.As I came to know those women from their perspective, I was eager to overlay their memoirs onto the Sacred Text that immediately follows. Comparing their reflections with the Gospel made what took place more real, vivid and meaningful. Even more so with the Walking it Out section that concludes the chapter. That’s where it’s our turn to meet Jesus. Where the authors zoom in on more insights and finer details of the culture, lifestyle and beliefs at the time of Christ. They also put together the Talking it Over questions at back of the book to help us interact with the biblical narrative on our own or in a group setting,The Day I Met Jesus reveals how there is so much than what meets the eye. Things I never thought of before. Like how was it the accusers just happened to catch that woman in adultery? That Mary of Bethany who brazenly sat at Jesus’s feet, boldly poured expensive perfume over His feet, quietly held back defending herself against disapproval. It was a real eye-opener when the authors pointed out the unlikelihood the Samaritan woman, marred with a stained reputation, would be taken seriously when she returned to her village telling people about her exchange with Jesus. Yet, they followed her back to see for themselves and were subsequently converted. Clearly, they noticed something different about her.I loved the way this book captures how the Jesus who touched the lives of those women wants to do the same for you and me. Forgiveness, grace, acceptance and boundless love are ours. Today. Here and now. Sins, mistakes, hurts washed away to make room for life redeemed and free. Shame is wiped away and new life springs forth. Once we  meet Jesus, our lives will never be the same again. Just like the five women.I met Jesus in a new and powerful way through this book. I think you will too.Disclosure – Many thanks to BakerBooks for the complimentary copy of the book in exchange for this unbiased review.\n\n', '\n\n  This book beautifully writes 5 perspectives of women in the gospels. This book brings alive the testimonies and lives of women who Jesus ministered to. I enjoyed how the authors gave a cultural understanding of the background of these women with a most likely story of what they would have been going through and thinking. It helped me to understand these women in a deeper level and a greater understanding of the power of the love of Jesus.This book has been provided courtesy of Graf-Martin Communications and Baker Publishing Group. :)\n\n']"

  A ""sublimely creepy"" psychological thriller from #1 New York Times bestselling author Colleen Hoover (Tarryn Fisher, New York Times bestselling author).Lowen Ashleigh is a struggling writer on the brink of financial ruin when she accepts the job offer of a lifetime. Jeremy Crawford, husband of bestselling author Verity Crawford, has hired Lowen to complete the remaining books in a successful series his injured wife is unable to finish. Lowen arrives at the Crawford home, ready to sort through years of Verity’s notes and outlines, hoping to find enough material to get her started. What Lowen doesn’t expect to uncover in the chaotic office is an unfinished autobiography Verity never intended for anyone to read. Page after page of bone-chilling admissions, including Verity's recollection of the night her family was forever altered. Lowen decides to keep the manuscript hidden from Jeremy, knowing its contents could devastate the already grieving father. But as Lowen’s feelings for Jeremy begin to intensify, she recognizes all the ways she could benefit if he were to read his wife’s words. After all, no matter how devoted Jeremy is to his injured wife, a truth this horrifying would make it impossible for him to continue loving her.

INDEED!\n', '\nMind blown  KABOOOOOM\n']","['\n\n  I ended 2018 with a book I found very unpleasant and irritating. My apologies to those who loved this novel, but it just wasn’t for me. I usually enjoy domestic psychological thrillers, but need to have one likeable character with which to empathize. I found all three main characters despicable.  An attempt here to combine erotica with a  thriller detracted from any buildup of mystery and suspense for me. The many sex scenes were quite explicit, and perhaps I am becoming prudish, but I wanted more a more creepy factor. This certainly existed but kept being pushed into the background by both women’s lust for Jeremy. There was a good plot somewhere here, but sad to say I felt all these hateful people deserved one another. The ending seemed forced and implausible.\n\n', '\n\n  I’ve read quite a few of Colleen Hoover’s novels and been impressed by how emotionally intense her love stories are. So when I saw she wrote her first suspense thriller, I knew I was in for a quite a ride.The novel follows Lowen Asleigh, a struggling author, who’s in a dire financial state. She’s gotten an eviction notice for her apartment and doesn’t have a new manuscript to sell to publishers, having spend most of her time caring for her terminally ill mother. Then she gets an offer of a lifetime. Bestselling Verity Crawford has gotten badly injured in car accident and her husband, Jeremy Crawford, wants Lowen to finish her popular novel series. Desperate to keep a roof over her head, Lowen accepts. She comes over to the Crawford’s secluded house in Virginia to go through Verity’s notes and outlines for future novels. Instead, she stumbles upon Verity’s unfinished autobiography detailing disturbing thoughts and chilling admissions, including a confession of what really happened the day Verity and Jeremy’s daughter died. Should Lowen show the autobiography to Jeremy, who’s a devoted to his injured wife and oblivious to her true character? Or keep it to herself and not devastate an already grieving father and husband?I honestly didn’t know much more than that going into this novel and I feel like that really is the best way of experiencing it. Go into this blind and the reveals and admissions will horrify you.There were parts that difficult for me to read, that left me feeling sick to my stomach. And yet, I couldn’t stop reading out of morbid curiosity. I needed to know what will happen next. How will it end? And yes, the ending shocked me more than the whole book. It left me second guessing everything I thought knew leading up to it. And yet, it fits so well!My opinions on the characters changed from like to hate and hate to like by the time the novel ended. I won’t say who I liked and disliked for that will spoil it (and I will want readers going into this blind!). But I will say this, there are two points of views in this novel, Lowen’s and Verity’s, and they’re very distinct from each other. The pacing didn’t drag or feel rushed, it felt even, just perfect.Do yourself a favour and don’t read this at night like I did. I really regretted it because I was freaking out and unable to sleep. This story is definitely going to haunt me.\n\n', ""\n\n  This is a good vs evil relationship dynamic, set inside the very intimate quarters of marriage turned family. It only gets worse when the most innocent are forced to pay the highest price of all. Heartbreaking! Author Colleen Hoover, unleashes the most terrifying & unfit of character's. Meet Verity, trusted wife, mother and best-selling author, aka selfish, sex-crazed, obsessive, control-freak psychopath. A woman devoid of conscience who runs roughshod over her sweet children and partner, by giving them no voice. Wouldn't ya know it? Evil Verity marries Jeremy, a golden Saint of a man, who any woman would deem herself the luckiest woman alive, to call him husband.  He is the loving personification of husband, father, citizen - a true family man, tasked with the role of  chief bottle-washer and nurturer, but not in a weak way. ENTER Lowen - the reluctant heroin of the story. She is hired by Jeremy to finish writing some books for Verity, after a car accident. A final twist is thrown into the plot at the end of the book, presenting us with a startling new revelation which gives us pause, with much left to think about. This book is not without its weaknesses, but overall, I recommend this absorbing novel.\n\n"", '\n\n  I hate Verity Crawford.This book had me on the edge of my seat from the first sentence. I have read some pretty dark reads and loved every word of them but this dark book was even more twisted. I couldn\'t put it down, except of course when real life called.  The detail of characters is very intriguing and I knew from the moment that Verity ""looks"" through the window at Lowen that she saw her.The story in the story always fascinates me because technically you get two great reads in one and this is no exception. The twists & turns draw you in and honestly the manuscript whether was supposed to be what actually happened and the note discovered after was to cover it up or not just left me with my mouth hanging open.  I honestly feel that the 5 star rating system need to change because 5 stars just seems like a low score for such an amazing book.Thanks for the ability to read this Ms. Hoover, it\'s amazing.\n\n']"

I liked it a lot more than Red Queen and I felt like the writing and craftsman ship has gotten better.

She very quickly gets what she asks for when she finds out that her unknown father was a very powerful man and, since his death, she is the only one of his bloodline remaining- a bloodline that is needed to save her world from a dark and deadly force. Along with a ragtag group of misfits (a squire who could never quite make it as a knight, an assassin eager for revenge, a bounty hunter, a sorceress, an Immortal and a counterfeiter) Corayne travels distant lands she only dreamed of, but now everything she knows and loves is on the line and she must be willing to risk it all.Victoria Aveyard returns to the YA fantasy world with her new novel, “Realm Breaker”. I was a fan of Aveyard’s previous “Red Queen” series, and was very excited to get my hands on this (LENGTHY!) novel.“Realm Breaker” very much had a “Game of Thrones” aspect to it, in that there are several ancient kingdoms at war for the crown, with knights, Royalty, Immortals, witches and a plain old normal protagonist, disowned by her father, with a “special gift”. Honestly, even the lands themselves reminded me of the various Kingdoms in the GOT series, and the “raised from the Dead” army was something right out of Martin’s fantasy world. Good thing for Aveyard- I’m a huge fan of Thrones, and George R.R. Martin.Corayne is exactly what you’d expect from a young, female protagonist. Desperate to find her place to fit in, she soon discovers that she (and only she) can save the entire world. Sure, it’s a trope that’s been done before (again and again), but it doesn’t make it any less entertaining.I enjoyed the characters in Aveyard’s novel, as she manages to make each and every one (good and evil alike!) show redeemable qualities. There is almost a constant stream of action, with swordplay, regular old fisticuffs and even fights on horseback (which led to death and harm of some horses, which I am NOT happy about!).Each chapter was narrated by one of the main characters, and it was clearly marked and identified. Corayne was the main narrator of course, but the majority of the others take their turns as well. Not only did this method bring more depth to Corayne’s journey and its importance, but it shed some light on the characters and lands that exist in this world, outside of Corayne’s own.Aveyard is obviously going to be continuing this journey with future novels, which the ending suggests, but there was also enough of a conclusion to be completely gratifying. With action-packed twists and fantastically quirky main characters, I am definitely looking forward to reading more of the “Realm Breaker” series.\n\n', ""\n\n  I really enjoyed the Red Queen series so I was very existed to read Victoria Aveyard's newest release! Realm Breaker is very different from Red Queen. It is a high fantasy story with multiple pov characters. It gave me Game of Thrones vibe. There has very well thought out and expansive world building and it's implied that there is this rich history to it. We also get chapters from different characters that are all interconnected and from different sides of the conflict. There's a squire, an immortal, an assassin, a queen, and the heir to kingdom. To me it read a lot more like high fantasy than ya which made it a little difficult to get into at first. It really started too pick up towards the middle to the end of the book. That being said not a whole lot happens in this first instalment. It's very much a setup for the next book. I'm interested to see how the story continues to play out and I hope that there are more chapters from Erida's point of view because she is by far my favourite character. So much so that I felt some of the other characters chapters dragged on or were unnecessary. I really excited to see how a certain relationship of her plays out.Overall 3.5 starsRecommend for high fantasy fans that enjoy rich world building and multi-pov stories\n\n""]"

Weston’s PTSD and status as a recovering alcoholic serve as reasons to keep his Shel at a distance, and his grumpy, prickly attitude help to get the job done. Being back home is bittersweet for Shel. Yes, she gets to spend quality time with her grandmother and brother, and reconnect with friends, but having Weston nearby is torture. She has never stopped loving him, even when he failed to keep his promise to write her while he is when in the army and basically ghosted her. She left home for her education and dream of a career in preserving history, but she still wants to know why he broke his promises and why they are now more like enemies than friends. Strange incidents and strangers as well as his mischievous pig who had a crush on Shel, keep nudging Weston and Shel toward each other. Weston is at war with his conscience and his need to protect Shel. The chemistry and history between them is hard to ignore and soon passion takes over. But he tells himself it is temporary, she is leaving and that they don’t have a future together. The strange incidents soon take a dangerous turn, and Shel and Weston are scrambling to protect loved ones and each other. Will these two take a chance on a happily ever after or will they suffer more heartbreak?I loved Weston and Shel. They are both strong-willed, stubborn, passionate and big-hearted. Their chemistry is over the top, combustible and impossible to ignore. Their story provides lots of steamy, passionate encounters and a beautiful, eternal love that both try very hard to deny right up until the moment they finally surrender to it. This book was captivating and addictive. I received a free copy of this book via Booksprout and am voluntarily leaving a review.\n\n', '\n\n  This is an entertaining, friends-to-lovers romance set in Dallas, North Dakota – a small town with a knack for attracting trouble; quirky, loveable grannies; and a menagerie of animals who often manage to upstage their owners and steal the spotlight!I liked Shel’s determination to move on from her childhood dreams of a life with Weston – her brother’s best friend.  Easier said than done, however.  West was a man haunted by his war experiences; certain he was damaged beyond redemption and resolved to keep Shel in the dark and at arm’s length.  Again, not so easily done.  As a couple, I enjoyed the ease of their connection, and the sizzling chemistry between them.  I quite loved Hercules – West’s 100 lb. pet pig.  His very human-like behaviour, intelligence and amusing interactions with Shel and West, was very entertaining.Overall, there’s plenty of action, drama and some violence, humour and flirty banter along with several steamy, explicit scenes.  I found the story mildly suspenseful though, with the identity of the villain and his intentions not much of a surprise.I received a free copy of this book via Booksprout and am voluntarily leaving a review.\n\n', ""\n\n  I am truly, madly in love with Weston and his sidekick Hercules the pig.  I am in hog heaven.  I love pigs so this story reeled me in immediately.  As a young girl, Rachel was part of the 3 Musketeers with her brother Marty and the crush of her life, Weston.  He always knew the right things to say including his corny jokes when she was feeling down.  Weston was her champion, her Knight on a White Charger.  But he only saw her as Marty's kid sister.She was devastated when he went into the Army and left her wondering why he did not write her like he said he would.  Rachel moved on and left her small town determined to see her dreams come to fruition.  Many years later, she returns home to realize Weston is back.  When Weston sees Rachel, he is shocked to see how much she has grown both physically and mentally. He knows he cannot go back to how they were before. He is not the same person she remembers when they were younger.Their story is heart wrenching and will pull your emotions right out of your chest.  They both will not admit their true feelings for each other. These two together with a pig that is smart as a whip (and steals many scenes in this story), will have you rooting for everything to work out.  You need to read this funny, suspenseful, romantic, sizzling hot and endearing story.\n\n"", ""\n\n  Loved it! Weston is Shelly's (Rachel) next door nneighbour and her brother's childhood best friend. Shelly has crushed on West forever, he broke promises and her heart when he up and joined the army and left town. Shelly grew up, left her small-town home in Dallas, North Dakota and pursued her love of history, got her degree and landed a great job in the city. She finds herself back in Dallas to help out at the family B&B while Gram has hip surgery. No problem, a couple weeks home then she will live out her dream job in the city. Ha! Now the fun begins. This was a story that started out with West and Shelly at each other's throats with tension and bitterness but as the story progresses so do they. It was a fun, steamy and at times hilarious road to travel to get this HEA. Enjoy!I received a free copy of this book via Booksprout and am voluntarily leaving a review.\n\n""]"

  It can safely be said that Lord Barnaby Greenwood is not having the best of Christmases.He’s penniless, up to his eyeballs in debt, and about to lose his estate. Therefore, it’s hardly surprising that when a local property developer offers a lot of money to buy King’s Wood from him, Barnaby is very tempted. But his father had always impressed on him that the green wood was sacred and must be protected at all costs, so he finds himself saying no.He knows this will result in the loss of his home, but duty comes before everything. However, that fateful decision leads instead to a magical Christmas for Barnaby, complete with an old god who grants him a favour, and a beautiful statue that comes to life.Cosmo is perfect for him. He’s funny and kind and completely enraptured with Barnaby, and for the first time in his life, Barnaby falls in love. But how can this lead to anything but heartache, when on the last stroke of midnight on Christmas Eve, Cosmo will go back to being a statue and take Barnaby’s heart with him?From bestselling author Lily Morton comes a truly magical romantic comedy.

I have read essentially all her books.This one opens with Barnaby, Lord Greenwood, refusing to sell King’s Wood to an unpleasant developer. He realizes that the refusal is likely empty since the bank will foreclose on his manor and lands as he is in bad shape financially. He goes to the sculpture room to talk with his favourite statue. While he is there, he meets the Holly King who rewards him for saving the Wood by bringing that statue to life, only until Christmas Eve – 5 days. Cosmo, the statue, has been given access to magic by the Holly King and his use of it is really funny as is his naivete when it comes to humans. This results in the two of them having a whole series of adventures that had me chuckling throughout. Luckily, at a time when other statues come to life, one of them lets Barnaby know what to do to have a happy ending.This story was wonderful and magic, bringing forth the miracles of Christmas.

At the heart of my fear, my worry, there’s him—Commander Rip.Known for his brutality on the battlefield, his viciousness is unsurpassed. But I know the truth about what he is.Fae.The betrayers. The murderers. The ones who nearly destroyed Orea, wiping out Seventh Kingdom in the process. Rip has power sizzling beneath this skin and glinting spikes down his spine.

The first book definitely sets you up to continue this journey. I loved reading to see what would happen next between Auren and Rip and the other characters. There were parts that I could do without but there would have definitely been things lost in the end if they had been taken out or written differently. I have never been a fan of being pulled away from the main character to a side character but I trust that Raven has a reason for focussing on these other characters and the information will be tied together in the end. I understand people’s dislike of how weak and “damsel in distress” Auren is but at the same time she has been hiding from the world and being kept captive and used for a decade of her life… I believe in the end, or I’m really hoping that she is starting a journey of self discovery that although may be too slow for some is necessary for the story. And these endings are killing me… 😅 I just couldn’t wait for the third book\n\n', ""\n\n  4.5 stars rounded up! “𝑲𝒊𝒏𝒅𝒏𝒆𝒔𝒔 𝒔𝒉𝒐𝒖𝒍𝒅𝒏'𝒕 𝒉𝒂𝒗𝒆 𝒕𝒐 𝒃𝒆 𝒆𝒂𝒓𝒏𝒆𝒅.

The build up between the main character and the potential(?) love interest is a perfect slow burn that I look forward to in the next book of the series. I do want to warn readers if you don't like feeble minded female leads the main character of this story will absolutely enrage you. Getting to the final chapters of the book I was nearly going to stop reading, this is commendable to the author's writing because she means for it to do this to the readers, or at least I hope she does. I was getting flash backs to Twilight with the clear ridiculous red flags of controlling/abuse but unlike that series this author clearly was meaning to write it like this as part of the plot. I have amazon unlimited, and I purchased the second book in this series because I do wish to reread it.\n\n"", '\n\n  Book 2 -- finally Auren gets some backbone... in the first book she was annoyingly docile the lonely caged golden goose, finally she starts to spread her wings and stands stronger in her own worth, but of course get loyalty to Midas is a continuing blind spot.The characters gain more depth and we learn the dark 4th army has more kindness than the golden palaces.The saddles still refuse to befriend Auren, so she is alone amongst enemies.\n\n', ""\n\n  Oh that ending! Wow! The series has so far been a binge read for me. I really can't put the books down and I'm not mad about it. I hate leaving spoilers in reviews so all I'll say is that it carries on where Gild left off. The worldbuilding also expands and some great new characters enter the series in book 2!For those who didn't relate to the heroine in book 1, we get to see more of the real Auren in Glint and she is easy to empathise with and like. The last few chapters were perfection! *chef's kiss*\n\n"", '\n\n  Okay first things first. I have never hated a character this much since Tamlin but wow, Midas, you did it. You’re a trash bag filled garbage human. Oh my god I can’t even describe how much I hate him and how manipulative he is. I read this book even faster than book one and although I saw the twist coming I AM HERE FOR IT. YES. This book was so refreshing I loved it, it didn’t even drag for me. *chef’s kiss*I am going to immediately start book three.\n\n', '\n\n  Loved this entire book! It was hard to read in some places but the good parts outweigh the bad. I’m not a huge fan of the Queens POV, I think Raven could have gotten away with mentions of what she does. I wanted to hear more about the fmc and the people she’s surrounded by. Can’t wait to read book 2!\n\n', '\n\n  I loved this book although there were some parts where I was the one clenching my jaw. Auren can be quite daft which became frustrating. I realize she was manipulated but I hoped she’d realize how blind she’d been a lot earlier. I’m excited to see where she goes next now that her eyes have been opened… the hard way. I loved the new characters and the budding relationships she’s forming. I can’t wait to see her fully come into her powers and become the badass I know is lurking underneath.\n\n']"

But Lazarus has her own extraordinary gift: she cannot be killed—not by humans, not by the elements, not by Death himself.She is the one soul Death doesn’t recognize. The one soul he cannot pry free from her flesh. Nor can he ignore the unsettling desire he has for her. Take her. He wants to, desperately. And the longer she tries to stop him from his killing spree, the stronger the desire becomes.When Lazarus crosses paths with the three other horsemen, an unthinkable situation leads to a terrible deal: seduce Death, save the world. A hopeless task, made all the worse by the bad blood between her and Thanatos. But Death’s attraction to her is undeniable, and try though she might, Lazarus cannot stay away from that ancient, beautiful being and his dark embrace.The end is here.

Marco is welcomed kindly by her people—and by Keegan, leader of the Fey. Keegan has trained Breen as a warrior, and his yearning for her has grown along with his admiration of her strength and skills.But one member of Breen’s bloodline is not there to embrace her. Her grandfather, the outcast god Odran, plots to destroy Talamh—and now all must unite to defeat his dark forces. There will be losses and sorrows, betrayal and bloodshed.

  From the number-one bestselling author of The Nightingale and The Great Alone comes a powerful American epic about love and heroism and hope, set during the Great Depression, a time when the country was in crisis and at war with itself, when millions were out of work and even the land seemed to have turned against them. “My land tells its story if you listen. The story of our family.”Texas, 1921.  A time of abundance.  The Great War is over, the bounty of the land is plentiful, and America is on the brink of a new and optimistic era.  But for Elsa Wolcott, deemed too old to marry in a time when marriage is a woman’s only option, the future seems bleak.  Until the night she meets Rafe Martinelli and decides to change the direction of her life.  With her reputation in ruin, there is only one respectable choice: marriage to a man she barely knows.By 1934, the world has changed; millions are out of work and drought has devastated the Great Plains. Farmers are fighting to keep their land and their livelihoods as crops fail and water dries up and the earth cracks open.  Dust storms roll relentlessly across the plains.  Everything on the Martinelli farm is dying, including Elsa’s tenuous marriage; each day is a desperate battle against nature and a fight to keep her children alive.In this uncertain and perilous time, Elsa—like so many of her neighbors—must make an agonizing choice: fight for the land she loves or leave it  behind and go west, to California, in search of a better life for her family.The Four Winds is a rich, sweeping novel that stunningly brings to life the Great Depression and the people who lived through it—the harsh realities that divided us as a nation and the enduring battle between the haves and the have-nots.  A testament to hope, resilience, and the strength of the human spirit to survive adversity, The Four Winds is an indelible portrait of America and the American dream, as seen through the eyes of one indomitable woman whose courage and sacrifice will come to define a generation.

It\'s all the same.""\n', '\nPerseverance\n']","['\n\n  I must admit that I am stranger to these type of pedastrian plot driven popular novels.  I loved the quasi historical fiction element of the Dust Bowl migration outling the classist inhumane treatment of migrants in their own  country.  This is despicable and although no where even close to the abomination  of slavery, we do get to see the areas where classism and racism have similarities.My problem with the novel is that is so simplistic. I suppose this author knows her audience and clearly it is not me.The portrayal of the Italian American family alerted me immediately to the many flaws in this novel. Italians living in rural farming communities were not buying imported olive and the other stereotypical Italian foods. This part is just silly. These imported products would not have been readily available.Also, the idea that Italian parents would disown a SON and prefer his ""white"" girlfriend who shows up pregnant, is again very silly. Anyone who knows anything about Italian sons knows that their mothers never reject them in favour of pregnant white girls. The next thing about this is the casting of Italians as another race using expressions of ""dark"" and ""olive skinned.""  Italians are members of the white race and although they were cast as different and discriminated against for their culture, they were still white.As for the ""communist"" labour organizers there is nothing out of the ordinary about this, but it interesting to see reviews about how offensive any reference to communism is to some readers. One must remember this is before the realizations about totalitarian governments were very different than true Marxism.Now for our heroine, she is an OK character. She sacrifices everything for her family and the majority of women understand that deep love of one\'s children that permeates and consumes our lives.Overall, I could not finish this repetitive novel. It seems the author who I see churns these types of books out for her legion of fans, also just rehashes the same chapters over and over. It\'s like each new chapter is just a rewritten summary of the one before it. I was astounded she gets away with this to be honest in her attempt to churn out 400 pages... I must also add that the bedroom  scene near the end where Jack wants the ""lights on"" so he can ""see her"" made me laugh out loud. So hokey.This book is an attempt to write a Harlequin romance version of Grapes of Wrath.\n\n', ""\n\n  I grew up with a Dad who lived through the dirty 30s in Saskatchewan, where there are a lot of similarities in terms of what the dust storms, etc., were like.  Everything described in this book in regard to the weather matches the stories he told me.  I also read the Grapes of Wrath many years ago and this book reminded me of that, in terms of illustrating the despair of the people.  I found this book to be just stunning.  I learned a great deal about the migrant workers in California at the time.  I thought that Elsa was one of the most powerful females I've read in a book in recent memory.  The author did a beautiful job of depicting how Elsa finally found her voice.  Every bit of this book was believable.  Every character was living and breathing and speaking in my mind's eye.  I could hardly put it down and stayed up late last night because I simply had to finish it.  Yes, the subject matter is filled with despair and hopelessness, however, there is a thread of hope and positivity and strength that runs through the whole thing and saves it from being a depressing read.  This is a book I will likely read again and I expect I will find even more depth in each character when I do.\n\n"", ""\n\n  This excellent book about the Dust Bowl and the Great Depression has taken me back to my grandmother's stories about the era. After one year of COVID-19, this book showed me how this period, tragic as it is, pales in comparison to what the greatest generation endured for more than a decade.\n\n"", '\n\n  ""Be Brave... or pretend to be. It\'s all the same.""This is one of my favourite quotes in this inspiring, touching and eloquently written novel by Kristin Hannah.Elsa pretended to be brave her entire life, was quiet and at times subdued, until she was faced with her children\'s survival, and their future. Then she realized that she was brave.I gave this novel 4 stars, although it touched me deeply, and I did shed multiple tears throughout the time it took me to read it. It was a depressing tale, that during these dire times today, made me feel the ultimate sadness; for the people during the depression, for the Oakies, and for those during today\'s epic tales of struggle and despair.""Hope has taught me to stand up and find my woman\'s voice even in this mans world.""Elsa\'s character was always afraid to step out of her comfort zone, to do the inexplicable and to live and love a mundane life because that was all she knew, or that she thought she knew.She is a character to be admired, and unlike any character that I have known Hannah to write. She depicted Elsa as a true heroine in every sense of the word, her struggles with being a wife, being a mother, and being a woman were written in such a way that you were sentenced to sit back and reflect on your own struggles.As usual the imagery associated with Hannah\'s writing was second to none, as was her character definition, because every character in this novel is ultimately unforgettable.Another great one from Kristin Hannah.Thank you for writing this novel.\n\n', '\n\n  Someone on Good Reads suggested this was their favorite book, I must admit it wasn’t my favorite , nor was it her best in my opinion. I believe books come to us when we need them and had I read this during a different time in my life it might have meant more to me. That being said, it was well written and taught us about a part of history I’d never read much about before. It teaches us about hardships and how that makes us better people, slowly and almost without us realizing it . Elsa was a warrior in so many ways.\n\n']"

The amount of character development, however, is insurmountably greater than in the first instance. Many characters that struggled to accept plot-relevant revelations finally realize that, in one of the best inner reflections in the series so far, ""death is lighter than a feather, and duty heavier than a mountain.""My favorite character from the first book appeared again, resurrecting from uncertain death, some new characters were introduced and one completely stole the scenes he was featured in. Reading Hurin and Rand\'s interactions always brought a smile to my face, and the progression of tone in their conversations served well to foretell heavier stakes in the story. Subtle, yet expertly done.The motivation behind Thom\'s decision to eventually follow Rand\'s journey was undoubtedly the most shocking moment in the entire book. I was not expecting the sudden loss and determination birthed from such a tragic event. While being intrinsically realistic, given the absurd setting and culture of the people from Cairhien, it was also heartbreaking to recognize that the wheel cares not for the plans of men. If in the first book characterization was good, in the second it gets even better. All major characters renew their determination, face difficulties that will mold their future interactions, and set in motion events that promise to change the life of everyone in the books to come.The world is further increased in size and complexity with all the lore, important regions visited, and new threats that appear from unknown lands. Just from reading the first two books, I can already tell that The Wheel of Time is among the best fiction world ever written, and I can not wait to see the plotlines and worldbuilding all come to fruition in the next instances of the series.The Great Hunt was an all-around improvement when compared with the previous entry, but it still suffers from the same slow buildup that only gets satisfyingly tight-paced towards the conclusion. That, in my opinion, is not completely a negative point, as all the worldbuilding and character development is fundamental if a gratifying completion is desired. However, the initial seventy percent of the story still distinctively feels like a huge setup and can get difficult to push through all shifts in point of view.\n\n', '\n\n  the best saga I have ever read and will ever read.

This kind of pattern always screws me up (I’m a one or two session reader, often just one!) and leaves me uncertain how I feel about a story. Enter, FOR THE WOLF.I liked so much of this but was equally confused by just as much. This is a story that I definitely need to reread because I think it’s possible this would be an easy four star if I had read it normally.There are shades of familiar fairytales woven into the roots of this spooky forest magic story. But these parts are made equally their own thing. This is not YA but is written with similar YA beats, yet manages to be dark without crossing any ‘can’t turn back now’ lines.While this had some absolutely lovely turns of phrase, a slowburn romance, and tons of forest aesthetic, I definitely lost track of some scenes or events as they played out, and I did find myself losing the thread of the worldbuiling (probably explained in the beginning and then just forgotten, because I’m dumb and was too slow to read this; though I also think the mythology is supposed to be uncertain and skewed and that doesn’t help?), but I am definitely going to be keen for the follow up.\n\n', '\n\n  “I’d let the world burn before I hurt you.”This adult, gothic reimagining of Little Red Riding Hood somehow reminded me of not just Little Red Riding Hood but also Beauty and the Beast and Snow White too. For the Wolf has all the things I need to get invested in a story. Retelling, romance, mystery, elemental magic, enchanted forest, complicated relationships - I got all these just from reading the first chapter.Fascinatingly twisted from the start, the mystery was more than enough to make me keep reading. I’ve always loved a story set in an enchanted forest/woodland and For the Wolf has all of what I loved and more with its magical world building. Played with the combination of myth, folklore and fairytale, a fantasy lover would love this story that has an eerie and spooky atmosphere.And while I fell in love with the theme of the story and its promising start, my feelings slowly changed mainly due to the excessive amount of exposition that left me confused at times. I also find conflicts that could have been resolved through proper communication is not my favorite.Perhaps because of the image that Little Red Riding Hood planted in my head, I expected more angst and banter from Red and Wolf. I got more interested with the secondary characters and I wish there was more of Raffe.I loved the setting and the overall aesthetic and I’m still interested to know what happens next because I’m definite that For the Wolf is just the beginning of a more twisted and darker world.Trigger Warnings provided by the author:-Self harm for magic use (cutting)-Parental neglect/emotional abuse-Mentions of physical symptoms that might be triggering to those with emetophobia-Anxiety/panic attacks-Parental death-Gore-Mild audio/visual hallucinations-Religious abuse-Medium-heat romance (non-explicit)\n\n', '\n\n  This is a dark, richly imagined world where the Big Bad Wolf isn’t exactly what you were always told.It’s a world where the First Daughter is for the Throne, the Second Daughter is for the Wolf, and the Wolf is for the Wilderwood.Twin sisters Red and Neve are devastated that soon Red will be sent to the Wilderwood forest as a sacrifice to the Wolf. Legend has it that the Wolf demanded that payment in exchange for keeping the monsters of the forest at bay. The people also want the Five Kings back, and they hope that this human sacrifice will appease the Wolf enough to free them. When Red arrives at the forest she discovers that her knowledge of the Wilderwood and the Wolf are mostly tall tales and soon she will have to harness her mysterious and budding powers to save her world.This novel has the classic dark and brooding male love interest, the heroine who doesn’t need any man to save her, and a few evil villains added to the mix. It is a slowly paced tale with rich detail that never feels like information overload. I prefer fantasy with well-developed characters over heavy plot and world-building. This book struck a nice balance between fully imagined characters and a forest that literally comes alive.I took one star off because, sometimes, I found the plot dragged. The romance wasn’t for me, but I’m sure others will enjoy it.Still, I can’t wait for the sequel!\n\n', ""\n\n  This came up as a suggestion at my local public library... I'm glad I took it.- It's modern twist on some older fairy tales... Yeah, the plot is kind of predictable (good vs evil), but eh! it's a fairy tale, not a thriller. Just turn your brain off and enjoy the story and try to imagine the scenery.Looking forward to her next book ;-)\n\n"", '\n\n  I love, love, loved this book. The characters are dynamic and tortured, the imagery rich and beautiful. There is also fantastic interplay between politics and religion and myth, compelling the reader to question what is good and evil and what just is. The bonds of obligation, love, and family tie this book together beautifully. I eagerly anticipating the next.\n\n', '\n\n  Loved this so much!

And of course like any great book tears were shed, some happy and some sad.

She has been dealing with her grief for a long time and its finally time to move on and start fresh.

As a member of the Gallo family – the Italian mafia, he’s a man of action and a risk-taker with a devil-may-care attitude and a well-earned reputation for getting into trouble.  I loved Camille!  She was hard working, feisty, smart and quick with a clever comeback when taunted with insults meant to belittle her.  I enjoyed how Nero and Camille first connected through their mutual love of classic cars.  As a mechanic herself, she truly was the rare female who could keep him intrigued outside of the bedroom.  As a couple these two were drawn together like steel to a magnet forming a tight connection through their similar life experiences.While this story is a bit of a departure from the chaos and vengeful scheming we’ve witnessed in the previous tales, it does contain some violence along with plenty of drama, action, adventure and suspense.

Nero and Camille bring out mostly the best out of one another, even when they banned together to commit a crime. I sat down to get started on this book and looked at the clock, two hours had already past! This book will pull you in immediately, it contains twists and turns that drive the story forward and challenge the characters. Nero and Camille figure out they make a good team while they also find themselves in an unlikely but steamy relationship. Enjoy this amazing book!

Not one girl had captured his attention until he chanced upon Camille. They seemed to keep running into one another at different times.

I will preface this by saying that it wasn't my normal type of book. It wasn't thrilling, it didn't keep you on the edge of your seat. It was, however, very thought provoking. Matt Haig takes a very serious and prevlant issue in today's society - mental health- and centers and entire book around it. I found myself very curious about which life Nore would ultimately choose, if she would go back to her root life or whether she would choose any at all. There are so many possibilities in life, if we had only made a tiny or sometimes massive alteration in the choices we make. The book raised a lot of very interesting and relatable points about the regrets we all have in life, and while you may regret them, you ultimately regret what you think may have happened had you chosen a different path, not what could have happened. For example, if you regretted breaking up with an ex, what may have happened if you stayed. Your thoughts always tend towards the positive, but what if it hadn't been positive? Typically most people regret something, but no on truly knows what would have happened, positive or negative if you had chosen differently. This book makes you think in a way most fiction novels don't, and it teaches the reader a good life lesson... the choices you make, help shape you into the person you are... but those choices don't define who you are. You are whatever you want to be, and you are never trapped, sometimes it just feels that way. There is always a way out, and you matter. 🥰\n\n"", ""\n\n  Everyone should read this book.We've all wondered what our lives would be like had we made different decisions - now we can see what it would be like to live those lives.Matt Haig is a genius author who brings the reader so deep into the story that we feel a part of the story, and we likely were meant to be.

Thank you, Matt for coming into my life and lifting my soul! Xo‘To fear love is to fear life, and those who fear life are already three-parts dead’.\n\n"", '\n\n  The Midnight Library by Matt Haig is one of those books that really make you examine your existence as well as the choices you have made to get to where you are. Imagine there was a place where you could try another life you could have lived. A place where you could see how things would have been if you had made other choices. The question posed: What would you have done differently, if you had a chance to undo your regrets? This book is a mix of fiction and fantasy. It is written beautifully and is really touching. It’s lighthearted but also deeply moving and real. I felt every emotion while reading it. At the beginning of the book the main character gives up all hope in living only to discover through lessons learned along the way, that life is worth living. It taught me to be grateful of everything and everyone. It has easily become one of my favourite books of all time. I laughed, I cried, and I thoroughly enjoyed every bit of it.\n\n', '\n\n  This book was a great read and causes you to think about your own life path and the decisions made to get where you are. Really makes you realize that no version of life is ever perfect, and we need to appreciate what we have whenever possible.I thoroughly enjoyed this book and am going to be checking out other books by this author.\n\n', '\n\n  It was outlandish, creative, deeply moving, and just plain fun! You will be rooting for Nora to figure her life out!Books as portals? Yes please.\n\n', '\n\n  I loved the concept of Midnight Library. What if on the day of your death you could go back and see the lives you would have lived if only you had made certain choices differently. If you could fix your biggest, and smallest, regrets and see if you would have lived a happier more meaningful life. After losing her job and cat in the same day, a depressed Nora Seed gets this chance after chasing a bottle of antidepressants with one of wine.If you get past the stretch of imagination it takes to get you to the midnight library where Nora spends most of the book suspended between life and death you\'re in for an amazing book. A book about how the grass isn\'t always greener on the other side of the fence. And how the smallest changes in you and how you live your life can deeply impact those in your periphery. Like how no longer teaching piano to a young boy removes the last barrier keeping him from a life of mischief and crime. Or how not living in the house you reside in in your root life, being able to get meds for, and help take care of your aging neighbour means he ends up losing his independence and living in a nursing home.Haig writes a thought provoking novel about how all our decisions, big and small, have the grandest effects. And the choices we make about will truly make us happy. Making us answer for ourselves "" what is the best way to live"". And an underlying reminder that no matter how inconsequential we may think we are, we are all the difference to someone else.***TW: suicide, depression, overdose, death of a pet***\n\n']"

At least, he's not a beast all the time. As she adapts to her new home, her feelings for the faerie, Tamlin, transform from icy hostility into a fiery passion that burns through every lie she's been told about the beautiful, dangerous world of the Fae.

I know that's unfair but I can't help it, I'm obsessed. I read an interview with the author in which she said that she wrote this book in a month while waiting for her first book series (Throne of Glass) to be published.

She's the epitome of strong and willing to put herself on the line for those she loves. She is a warrior!!Tamlin is a mystery. You don't learn too much about him which makes the mystery of him so appealing.There are many secondary characters that were very intriguing and added to the whole of the story beautifully. We meet Lucien, Ianthe, and Rhysand who I'm pretty sure is going to play a much bigger role in this series than I had realized at the beginning.This book has all the elements of a great series. The writing is flawless and the story flows quite seamlessly.I'm already into the second book and can't wait to see what the author has in store.\n\n"", '\n\n  I\'d give it a 2 1/2.

Since I have a vivid imagination and am familiar with the setting in Germany, I had no problems getting 'deeply' involved in the story. I didn't like Jack at the beginning since he seemed a bit rude and not always nice to his friend Sherk, who invited him to come along to visit Germany. Jack did not tell his friend that he had a special reason to accompany him. After I learned of the tragic loss of his wife and daughter through a bombing in Ireland, I understood him.It seemed a little far-fetched to find a lady who sent a letter from Munich to Jack's father about sixty years earlier without an address. But, familiar with German perfectionism, I accepted that it happened. I had to smile at how the author, Meg Lelvis, found a way to lead the reader deftly into the holocaust, the horror that happened in Dachau, one location of the concentration camps where undesirables and Jews were terminated. Some people might not read the book if they knew in advance...Meg is a psychologist and knows how to create characters that make you love or hate them. The feelings I experienced were one aspect I kept on reading - even if at times I would have given up. Despite a couple of anticipated surprises, the ending does not completely satisfy - unless it is book 3 of a series and another book is coming. Kudos to Meg for one message we can learn: A whole country was held captive, and criminals did the horrible deeds we cannot forget.\n\n"", '\n\n  This story takes place after WWII in Germany.

She explains the feelings and positions of the average German citizen.Many things happened right after the war with the citizens of Germany and the liberators, so much that the average person would never comprehend.

But it wasn\'t that at all; in fact, they never undress at the Gilded Room again!There is one scene in which Tristan thinks Freddie is a man but he refers to her as ""she"" and ""her"" in a paragraph.

Olivia\'s given us to characters I wanted to invest time in and get to know, and she managed to steer away from the usual tropes of ""whoops, I slept with the man I now realise is my new boss"" by giving us a strong female protagonist and a strong but caring and thoughtful male lead.

  ""The writing is addicting. I had trouble putting this one down and it was easy to be hooked."" - Jessica Belmont.Book Description:Two communities. One flower competition. So much dead-heading!Aldermaston’s having a bad day. A falling hanging-basket has killed the town’s mayor, and a second narrowly missed him. His wife wants him to build her new greenhouse in three days, and someone is sending him death threats. This isn’t the quiet life he expected as the new Marquess of Mortiforde.It’s the annual Borders in Blossom competition, and Mortiforde is battling with Portley Ridge in the final. But this is no parochial flower competition. The mayor’s mishap looks like murder, and there’s another body in the river. Someone desperately wants Portley Ridge to win for the fifteenth successive year.So when a mysterious group of guerrilla gardeners suddenly carpet bomb Mortiforde with a series of stunning floral delights one night, a chain reaction of floral retaliation ensues.Can Aldermaston survive long enough to uncover who is trying to kill him, and why? And can he get his wife’s greenhouse built in time?""Blooming Murder is, essentially, what would happen if Gardener’s World had an illicit love child by Midsomer Murders via the work of Tom Sharpe."" ~ PAJ Newman""With devilish and hilarious goings-on amongst the blooms, it is jam-packed full of wonderful and very likeable eccentric characters with a deliciously wicked streak of humour running through it. I loved every page and laughed my socks off at some bits."" ~ The Word Is Out Now“I loved this book and laughed such a lot at the going-ons in the village. A brilliant tale of jealousy, revenge and green-fingered criminality. I can not wait until the next book.” ~ The Devine Write""Simon Whaley’s Blooming Murder is a terrific cosy mystery perfect for Agatha Raisin fans. Full of eccentric characters, bucolic mayhem and mischief and village shenanigans, Blooming Murder is a fun, witty and entertaining mystery peppered with humour, intrigue and nail-biting suspense."" ~ Bookish Jottings“Whaley’s writing style is straightforward and hooks you instantly, and his plot builds steadily from there. Blooming Murder is a charming, engaging novel.” ~ Bibliotica""Blooming Murder reads like a mix of Father Brown and Rosemary & Thyme with the humor of Monty Python. The sheer amount of floral puns and innuendo propagated throughout had me laughing helplessly and marveling at the author’s cleverness and audacity!"" ~ PuzzlePaws""If you’re looking for a funny, cosy mystery with a cracking pace, you’ve come to the right place. Quintessentially British humour is in abundance here, as are the blooms… and the dead bodies. Now, the characters’ names might be tongue-twisters, but they perfectly sum up the vibe of this story—think of it as a mash-up of Carry On films, The Darling Buds of May and an Agatha Christie mystery and you’ll be primed for the Borders in Blossom competition where innuendo and double entendres are in full bloom."" ~ Just4mybooks.""To me, this came across Midsummer Murders meets a Carry On film!"" ~ CurledUpWithAGoodBook""I thoroughly enjoyed this book, it is a piece of ridiculous, riotous fun. If you are a fan of Midsomer Murders, with its pretty settings, eccentric characters and bizarre and convoluted murders, you will absolutely love this novel."" ~ A Little Book Problem  Read more  ",[],[],[]
 The Human Element: Overcoming the Resistance That Awaits New Ideas ,"['Loran Nordgren', 'David Schonthal']", CDN$ 15.99 ,0,  Best Sellers Rank:  #592 in Kindle Store (See Top 100 in Kindle Store)   #1 in Sales & Selling (Kindle Store)  #1 in Professional Sales & Selling  #2 in Sales & Selling (Books)  ,4.9 out of 5 stars,37 ratings,"
  Wall Street Journal bestsellerWatch your most innovative ideas take flight by overcoming the forces that resist change The Human Element is for anyone who wants to introduce a new idea or innovation into the world. Most marketers, innovators, executives, activists, or anyone else in the business of creating change, operate on a deep assumption. It is the belief that the best (and perhaps only) way to convince people to embrace a new idea is to heighten the appeal of the idea itself. We instinctively believe that if we add enough value, people will eventually say ""yes."" This reflex leads us down a path of adding features and benefits to our ideas or increasing the sizzle of our messaging - all in the hope of getting others on board. We call this instinct the ""Fuel-based mindset."" The Fuel-based mindset explains so much of what we do, from adding countless trivial features to software, to bolting a sixth blade onto a shaving razor. By focusing on Fuel, innovators neglect the other half of the equation – the psychological Frictions that oppose change. Frictions create drag on innovation. And though they are rarely considered, overcoming these Frictions is essential for bringing new ideas into the world. The Human Element highlights the four Frictions that operate against innovation. Readers will discover:  Why their best ideas and initiatives often get rejected – despite their undeniable value How to disarm the forces of resistance that act against change How to transform the very Frictions that hold us back into catalysts for change  Perfect for business leaders, product managers, educators, and anyone else who seeks to bring new and exciting ideas to life, The Human Element is an indispensable resource to help people overcome the powerful forces of human nature that instinctively resist change.

As the book went on I became more and more engrossed and that ending… Oh it was good. I think I literally said “oh c’mon”. An explosive and frustrating ending for sure. I loved it.I had a love-hate relationship with the female main character. Started off loving her, the dialogue is pretty funny and she had some fabulous one liners and banter throughout the book. Then she was kind of annoying and then I liked her again and I think I ended the book liking her.As for the men, I love me some psychos. So I’m already biased towards liking them, #sorrynotsorry. I just wish we had learned a little bit more about them, maybe some more points of views. I think their histories are going to be really interesting and I’m hoping their character development will be as well.Overall, I very much enjoyed this book and that cliffhanger has me aching for book 2. I’m not surprised, Sheridan has mastered the cliffhangers. Although, ideally, she doesn’t leave us hanging like this with the next book. Please don’t.\n\n', '\n\n  Roman Marcus And Levi are the psychos you didn’t know you wanted to love! And Shayne is the feisty FMC  that we all desire! This book is so dark and twisty and has all the spice! I can not wait to read book 2 Heathens and release day can’t come soon enough! What a cliffhanger! What a book hangover! Sheridan Anne has done it again and this book is not one to be missed! Psychos has made it to my top books of 2021 list as I’m sure the rest of this engrossing series will be! Read this book if you live dark, twisty and super spicy! Just be sure to read the trigger warnings as some people will want to run far far away from these gorgeous monsters whereas most of us will want to marry a psychopath! Marcus is mine though! Fair warning!\n\n', '\n\n  I’m not gonna give a long winded review on this book because if you have read anything by Sheridan you know this book is gonna be good. But o do have to say it’s definitely the darks book she has ever written. So if you aren’t into dark depraved straight up crazy books run,  run far away. But it you love yourself a good dark messed up story filled with so many twists and turns it’s hard to keep up dive in because their is no going back once you start this journey! And just so you know she leave us hanging off a cliff as tall as Mt Everest so yeah that!\n\n', '\n\n  I was so excited to read this book! From the moment I heard about it I had ""Sweet but Psycho"" by Ava max repeat in my head and it doesn\'t disappoint. If you know anything about Sheridan Anne, you know that she is able to create these beautiful messed up worlds that you want to be a part of even with the cliffhangers that make you question your own sanity, and RH is truly where she is meant to be <3 .I loved the fact that Roman, Marcus and Levi all had their own broken pieces. Stories that made them unique even though they are brothers and grew up in the same house of horrors.  I think it was important that it wasn\'t just Shayne who needs to rethink the way they see the world but the four of them in order to come together.There were points of the book where I felt like I was reading a dark retelling of beauty and the beast and that honestly made me love it even more.  These characters are so addicting and twisty I devoured every word that was written.Bring on Book 2!\n\n', ""\n\n  Another must read from this author, I recommend this book so hard, it's dark, and delicious, so steamy, and twisted.

They do all the work to make the bride’s day perfect. They follow along with the bride’s wishes and deal with the mounting pressure of the big day. The focus is always on the bride. Nina Manning’s, “The Bridesmaid,” mirrors this relationship in an unlikely friendship between two girls.Sasha first met Caitlin at Saxby House when they were children. Sasha’s parents work for the Clemonte’s on their estate. The girls were besties, inseparable, until the day Sasha has had enough. Enough of having to do things Caitlin’s way. Enough of putting up with Caitlin’s odd behaviour. Enough of the secrets.This novel is about toxic relationships and explores the reason behind these types of friendships. A slow burner, and more a mystery than a thriller, you’ll discover that nothing is as it seems. Like the one on the cover, a rose is beautiful to look at and has a beautiful aroma. However, every rose has its thorn and this rose, the bride, has a few. In an attempt to keep secrets for appearance's sake, people fail to connect with the most important people around them - thus perpetuating the problem. This is the bridesmaid’s story from the beginning of the friendship to the end of it.The author studied psychology and applied it to the relationships in this book. It’s a decades-long journey into why people behave the way they do. It’s a unique read because, for most of the book, the main characters are teenagers. Most psychological thrillers I’ve read have adult protagonists.I was gifted this advance copy by Nina Manning, Boldwood Books and NetGalley and was under no obligation to provide a review.\n\n"", '\n\n  I was unsure what to rate this. I really enjoyed this book and got sucked into it and boy was it ever a readable page turner...BUT it was not a thriller...not by my definition. This was more like a dramatic chick lit story with a bit of a mystery thrown in and I really liked it.The plot was interesting and I loved the format of before and now. It is told from the singular point of view and you really got to know the two main characters because of that. I really appreciate Nina Mannings writing style and the way she keeps you wanting to know more. The whole time I was reading this I kept saying to myself ""just one more chapter"". I was able to read it in a single sitting...that must account for something. Also, I would definitely read more by Miss Manning and that is a big complement.I am going to go with 3.5 Stars and round it up to 4 for the sheer readability factor.\n\n', ""\n\n  The Bridesmaid will hold your attention from the first paragraph to the last one.Sasha and Caitlin are childhood friends but their relationship is not an equal one for many reasons.

Most of the story was a slow build towards what I was hoping would be a carefully constructed surprise ending, but instead the last portion seemed rushed and more telling than showing. So great concept but the execution left something to be desired. But then again, I am picky. For readers who are just looking for a good distraction during pandemic lockdown or a distracting beach read, they'll like this. For those interested in authentic characters, clean story line and aha ending, not so much.\n\n"", '\n\n  3.25 stars.

Not long after moving in Sasha meets Caitlin, the privileged, wealthy, and mercurial daughter of the Clemonte family. The pair become fast friends and Sasha finds herself doing anything to maintain her friendship with Caitlin and to keep her happy. Fast forward about twenty years and Sasha, still the supportive friend, is meticulously planning Caitlin’s wedding to their childhood friend Chuck. As the wedding approaches, things start veering off course.The story is told from Sasha’s perspective during two timelines: when the girls are teens; and later, in their thirties. The chapters are short, which makes it easy to keep flipping the pages.This was a solid thriller, a bit slow at times, but one that I was still compelled to stay up late reading. I don’t know how I feel about the ending. I guess I was hoping for something more explosive to the tension that had been building. It did resolve things nicely, so there’s that. And it certainly changed my perception of some of the characters!Thanks to Netgalley and Boldwood Books for providing me with this ARC in exchange for my honest opinions.\n\n', '\n\n  I found it interesting from the moment I started it until the very end.

I was delighted therefore when I discovered it was on sale for $1.99 and promptly picked it up. And it is worth every good worth every good review it’s received and now I’m adding mine to the rest. It’s a delightful enemies to lovers romance.Lucy and Joshua are two executive assistants who sit side by side each working for a different CEO of a merged publishing company and right from the first day things have been strained. Lucy is a friendly, delightful young woman who is loved by everyone and Joshua isn’t. The first day they met Lucy smiled at him and Joshua ignored her and it’s been war between the two ever since. They are constantly trying to one up the other and their battles are delightfully written. I think I smiled through this entire book. There are so many cute moments in the book from where Lucy speed walks to keep up with Joshua on their way to the kitchen to them both going to HR about the other. The book is told entirely from Lucy’s POV so we don’t get why Joshua is such a jerk to her until later in the book and then are hearts start to melt and we all fall in love with him.There are so many already positive reviews for this book and I’m trying to keep this short so I’ll just finish up with read this book. It’s still only $2.99 and that’s a great price for something you are going to love.\n\n', '\n\n  Okay I’ve heard SO MUCH about this book and Joshua Templeton that I had to check this out for myself. 25% into the book and I was very confused. THIS is what everyone is flapping on about?? 50% into the book and I see the chemistry. But these two characters are so juvenile. It’s like watching wild animals mate. Biting and snipping at each other while getting it on. Where is the romance?? 75% into the story and I still don’t understand what the hell is really going on. It wasn’t until the last bloody chapter that we finally get any real headway into these characters and they are still holding back. I wanted to throw Josh’s ribbon pillow in my face and scream GROW UP!!! GAWD!!!! I’ll admit the way Josh takes care of Lucy is adorable and the way he can tell by a look in her face if she is freaking out. But he could have saved them both a whole lot of time if he just ask her out for pity sake.\n\n', '\n\n  From the very first chapter, I knew this wasn’t a typic  as l romcom. Sally Thorne has s literary style of writing that I’ve rarely encountered in the genre. It’s magically soothing and intoxicating all together. The book is a slow build to a beautiful climax (see what I did there?!) that feels so real. It’s a beautiful book and I’ll be reading it again I’m sure. But first, onto your next book. Thank you!\n\n', '\n\n  I have this book in paperback and on my ereader, so that I will always have it no matter where I am.  That’s how much I love it.  It is so good that I re-read it constantly and then I laugh loudly by myself at all the funny parts even though I know they’re going to happen.  And don’t get me started about Josh Templeman.... I want him to hold back my hair when I vomit ( you’ll understand this if you read the book) and who doesn’t love a guy who saves her lipstick kissed Post-it note and sticks it on his fridge, right?  I had no chance.  Neither do you... read this book... and you’re welcome!\n\n', ""\n\n  I enjoyed it from start to finish. I use to be an avid reader, but was going through a long cold spell of not reading anything. This book kept my eyes peeled to each page I turned. I really enjoyed the banter between the two leads, it kept things spicy. Would definarely recommend to friends and maybe if I'm feeling nice lend mine!\n\n"", '\n\n  Okay i give up on books easily but this one had me blushing and tearing up i love Joshua and Lucy’s chemistry and relationship development. To me, they are soulmates, and it’s a beautiful romantic journey. I love this book im so glad i read it, just a lovely read and ending. SPICY content. Joshua has certainly raised my standards in men….i recommend!\n\n', '\n\n  This was a gem of a book!  I had just finished ""Whisper Network"" and needed something a little light and not so much work to read.  ""The Hating Game"" was a super fast read as you just couldn\'t put it down as it moved nicely and quickly and had a great story line.  Loved the characters and could for sure see this as a movie.  Along the lines of the first Bridget Jones Diary category.  Left you with wanting more...  Not a serious book and for \'chick-lit\' this is probably one of the best ever written.\n\n', ""\n\n  I've had this book in my to-read for ages, but ever felt the urge to jump in. Even though the description grabbed me, I think the cover didn't really appeal to me.Glad I took the time to read. This book was quick a read for me right from the first page.

  Queen of Anarchy is the heart-pounding second installment in the Dirty Broken Savages series.Note: The blurb below contains spoilers for the first book, so I'd highly recommend not reading it until you've finished reading book one, Kings of Chaos. You've been warned!***I was a good girl once. But bad b*tches get shit done.My list is finished. Every name has been crossed off. I should be sipping cocktails on a beach somewhere, breathing easy for the first time in years.But I’m not.Because that asshole Ivan St. James refused to stay at the bottom of the river where Knox put him.Because someone dragged his body up from the depths and laid it out as a very public, very gruesome warning.Because I swear it was Hannah’s eyes I saw behind that mask.Nothing makes sense anymore, and if I thought I might find some peace in knowing that the men who hurt us are dead, I was wrong.The game isn’t over yet. The original deal I struck with the Kings of Chaos is null and void, and despite my plan to walk away from them when this was all done, there’s no way I can do that now.Our fates are entwined, at least until we sort out this mess.Honestly, I don’t know how to feel about that. Because as much as I refuse to let my walls down for anyone, I’m starting to think these four brutal, dangerous men…Might be the only ones I can trust.Queen of Anarchy is a full length mafia/gang new adult romance featuring a slightly psycho heroine and four even more psychotic men. This book contains dark themes, so please read at your own discretion. It is book 2 of 4.

There is also a roller coaster of emotions you will go through reading the book.We finally started to learn more about our guys and what made them the way that they are. As they were revealed you could see the shift in the dynamics of the relationships between them and River. I loved seeing their relationship change from the first book into this book.While there were not as many twists as book one this book definitely played with your emotions much more. From some events during the book to learning about their pasts and then finally the cliffhanger/emotional torment we saw, the author had you constantly on the edge of your seat.It was easy to become lost in these pages and although this book was a bit slower action-wise compared to book one, it was faster in regards to the relationship and with getting to know the characters more.After that very emotional ending I hope book 3 will help me recover.\n\n', '\n\n  “Kill for you.

It really gives more insight on how it effects him still in his daily life.Priest, that man is my second favorite. My favorite, favorite is Knox. I’m a sucker for a psychotic killer🥵The way River stops fighting to avoid the emotions and feelings she starts to have for the guys is always such a heartwarming thing. She also finally allows herself to be vulnerable around the boys. This one really hits all the feels. The moments she shares with all of them individually was so perfect.

And if I don’t ever see ‘babe’ or some variation of ‘oh crap’, ‘holy crap’, ‘double crap’, ‘triple crap’, it’d be too soon. I found the heroine, Iris, really annoying with her constant whining and dramatics. The hero, Dex, was so aggressive and possessive of her, but seeing how her life was endangered by rival MCs, her own stupidity, and then the mafia, I was able to overlook it. He also grew on me the more we got to know him and see his soft side. Their romance didn't work for me, but I did enjoy a few of their sweet moments.

Dex is absolutely one of the sweetest and sexiest alpha-males I have ever encountered.  He is badass to the bone, but when you reach inside he is warm, soft and sugar sweet. And Iris is goodness through and through, and SO strong, despite having the most awful luck any person could have.This is a long book no doubt, you get your money's worth and then some, but not once did it feel too long to me. For the most part, this is a perfectly paced, well told story with excellent character development. I fell in love with the lead characters as well as the supporting cast. These people were real to me and I enjoyed sharing their lives while getting to know them at a leisurely pace, instead of being rushed into an epic romance. The few sex scenes were super hot, but also very touching, and actually added to the story instead of driving it. It was like you could feel the bond growing deeper between Dex and Iris each time they got together physically....I picked this up after reading one reviewer asking people to support this author by buying this book, that just tugged at something in me. Now I understand that plea. This is an excellent book that should appeal to fans of authors like Kristen Ashley (of whom I am a huge fan!). This author is a great story teller and I can't wait to read whatever comes next!\n\n"", '\n\n  Great story it really pulls you in. Its like you can feel the words the characters are saying but, with that being said I thought Rissy was a little too naive.

I have read it several times and I generally never read a book more than once. I loved the author’s sense of humour.

Their story at times was so deliciously erotic that I think I bit my lip off while reading some scenes. Every time Kage growled, roared, or whispered dirty things in Natalie’s ear, I felt it deeply (I mean very deeply – my poor BOB got a good workout). IT WAS SO DAMN SEXY!!! These two are just perfect together. The chemistry between them was so explosive, that it just oozed off the pages.

And let’s not forget Sloan – she’s a MF queen in her own right! I can’t wait for her story.Definitely one of the best mafia books I have read! Phenomenal writing and brilliant storytelling.

Everyone needs a Sloan in their life and that girl definitely had no filter whatsoever. She definitely added plenty of fun to this.So when a tattooed hot stranger appears in town moving In next door to Natalie she tries to be friendly only to get shut down fairly swiftly. Kage well he is mysterious and grumpy and initially quite cold but he has his own secrets one's that might be very bad for Nat’s health.Kage has a conflict of interest He’s in town to complete a job one he realises that he can’t go through with and now because of this both of their lives will be placed in danger. he has secrets it’s obvious, but at the same time, he can be refreshingly blunt and almost honest.He tries to tell Natalie as much as he is able to and is transparent about the sort of man he is even going as far as to warn her away and tell her he is no good for her.There’s so much stuff that’s unfair about their situation and if you haven’t guessed this has mafia ties namely the Russian Bratva. I found this to be incredibly hot and Kage whilst lethal could also be very sweet. I liked where this went and it was an enjoyable read it’s slightly instalove which doesn’t always work for me here it did though and after that finish, I will definitely be picking up book two especially after the dramatic finale. It’s Sloane’s story next so I’m looking forward to jumping into that.\n\n""]"

  So you may ask, who is Adam Connor? He is the recently divorced, Academy Award-winning actor who just moved in next door with his kid. He also happens to be an exquisite male specimen and the most infuriating sly bastard I’ve ever come across.Let’s be honest here, wouldn’t you wanna take a peek over the wall to catch a glimpse of him, hopefully when he is naked? Wouldn’t you melt away after watching him work out as his five-year-old kid cheered him on? Do I even have to mention those abs, or those arm muscles? Oh, wait, you would never spy on him? Sure…While I was being thoughtful by not breaking and entering and was actually considering going over to offer him a shoulder—or maybe a boob or two—to cry on (y’know, because of his divorce), instead he had me thrown in jail after a small incident. Jail, people! He was supposed to grant me countless orgasms as a thank you, not a jail cell.After that day, I was mentally plotting ways to strangle him instead of jumping his bones to make sweet love. So what if my body did more than just shiver when he whispered dirty little things in my ear? I can’t be held responsible for that. And when was the last time he’d kissed anyone anyway? Who’d enjoy a kiss with a side of heart attack?Even if he and his son were the best things since sliced bread—and I’m not saying he was—I couldn’t fall for him. No matter what promises he whispered on my skin, my curse wouldn’t let us be. I wasn’t a damsel in distress—I could save myself, thank you very much—but deep inside, I still hoped Adam Connor would be the hero of my story.

This one is a slow burn that definitely journeys on the edges of acceptability so it may not be for every reader.However, for the rest of us who willingly follow in Queen Sav's footsteps and eagerly await her words, this one is breathtaking and emotionally enthralling. It has all the signature drama, damaged characters and exquisitely gritty sex scenes that makes a Sav R. Miller book so damn difficult to put down but there's an emotional element to this book that was so relatable and personal that it brought me to tears.The level of tragedy Riley has experienced is almost unfathomable to have survived and Aiden's level of celebrity is not something most would ever know yet I was so drawn to them. Their desire to be seen and loved yet wanting to hide their imperfections at the same time for fear of being unloveable is so universal. I love how it brought a dark sense of reality to this story making it all the more enjoyable because it resonated.This is a story to lose yourself in and just feel it all. From the exposing of every painful truth they wish would stay buried to revelling in every moment of light and softness that happens no matter how small. Riley and Aiden are damaged but not broken. The depth of their chemistry and attraction was so strong, it grabs and pulls you into their orbit. They fall in love in all the most imperfect of ways and I couldn't get enough of how it could feel so wrong but right at the same time.AND let's just be clear, this is not a retelling of the myth of Orpheus & Eurydice either so anyone expecting one can put their freaking 1-star reviews away.

Worse, the head doctor on the team assigned to her son looks very much like the man she had a short, but very sweet, summer fling with…and the father of the child she carries.Her life couldn’t get any harder or messier, but she will let nothing get in the way of getting the very best care for her son, even if it means staying married to her cheating husband to keep his health insurance and rebuffing the overtures of the doctor who thinks he recognizes her.Thankfully she has the support of her friends and neighbors in Blueberry Beach – her safe harbor in the middle of life’s storms.But even they can’t protect her from the heartache of losing everything she’s always held dear.Will her new baby be the beginning of tomorrow’s blessings?Reviews for Tomorrow's Blessings:★★★★★ “Could not put this book down! ...this story has interesting twists that keeps you reading; along with doses of humor that will make you laugh out loud.

It is a story of love, heartbreak, healing and of renewal. Anitra is a woman with an immense inner strength and fortitude. She nursed her terminally ill son on her own, and though she grieves his loss, she knows in her heart that he is without pain now and playing baseball in heaven. She also knows that God saw fit to bring someone into her life just as she was losing her son along with another unexpected gift. John is a doctor who has seen the circle of life many times in his care of young cancer patients. Heading up the new cancer wing at a hospital in Blueberry Beach would eventually free up more of his time and give him a chance to write books, and perhaps have a personal life for a change. He never expected to meet a pretty woman on the beach at sunset or to have a passionate interlude with her a few nights later. John’s new job at the hospital brings him back to Blueberry Beach a couple of months later and he doesn’t realize that she is the mother of one of his young terminally ill cancer patients. John even works with the townspeople to help keep Anitra’s diner afloat, though he doesn’t know she is his mystery woman. It isn’t until her son’s funeral that John finally realizes that Anitra is the mystery woman who captured his heart on the beach, and that their passionate night together had unforeseen consequences. There is a lot to sort out and to deal with even if they believe that God has guided them to each other.I am loving this new series of books. They are not as lighthearted as some of the other books in Jessie’s catalog, but they are beautifully written, captivating and include wonderful messages that we all need to keep in mind.

I really enjoyed getting to meet them all and hope to read or listen to more books in this series so I can come to know them all better.  I thought the storyline for this book was beautiful but also so very sad.  I also liked the fact that Ms. Gussman made the people real, even though the main characters are Christians she showed how they can still make mistakes but know that God forgives a repentant heart.  I would definitely recommend this book to anyone who enjoys a real story that could definitely happen in real life. Mr. Dyess does a wonderful job of bringing this book to life!I received a free code for this book from the publisher to listen to on Audible.  This review is my own honest opinion.\n\n', ""\n\n  In Tomorrow's Blessings, Jessie Gussman handles imperfect humans, grief and more in such a way that you will be swept up in this book.

It is wonderful how God makes miracles for his children. I highly recommend this book.\n\n"", '\n\n  John was used to being alone but when he meets Anitra he realizes what he has been missing.  Meeting John and getting as close as two humans can, gives her so much to look forward to.  Blueberry Beach is full of such wonderful people.

Such a satisfying ending. My only complaint is that I wish there was more. Although, I guess I am kind of getting my wish because the author announced a novella with a storyline I think I may have wanted to know more about than the conclusion of this series. Not that I didn’t love this book but I just need to know the contents of this novella. And if she would like to expand the novella to a big book so that we get all of the details that would be great.In regards to this book, I was thoroughly entertained throughout. As always, there was plenty of action, steam and we finally got the many answers we having been dying to know. I feel so satisfied with this ending. There are even parts I didn’t really expect or know I needed to happen but they did and it added to my enjoyment of the story.I loved seeing the characters and their dynamics change throughout the series. Each book was like witnessing a full transformation and the ending was the perfect accumulation of the changes.I would really like to point out that this book did not glaze over the mental health of some of the characters and I appreciated the realism that was shown. It was shown that mental health is an ongoing journey and that you will have ups and downs. Thank you to the author for showcasing this and showing that it’s not just an easy fix.A great conclusion to the series. I can’t wait to read the novella and see what this author will write next.4.5/5\n\n', '\n\n  Finally Hadley gets her HEA. That girl is the most deserving after everything she has been handed in life. Ever time someone called her “baby Davenport” my cold dead heart perked up, it’s probably one of my favourite things… other than her sweet relationship with Hawk. Thank god one of the parents turned out to not be the absolute worst. All of her guys brought out the best in her and the way they handled her PTSD was so good. I cannot wait for blurred lines and the new rejects series to continue on in this world.\n\n', ""\n\n  I loved the ending of the series.

I want want to get anything away but R.A. Smyth definitely took us on one heck of wild ride and let’s not forgot about the steamy times I literally had to fan my self a couple time hot damn and there were a lot twists , turns and definitely intense moments that had me gripping my kindle . I highly recommend you read this series you will not be disappointed !!!! I am really looking forward Rebels & Rejects coming out !!!!!\n\n', '\n\n  It’s always bittersweet when one of my favourite series comes to an end, but daaaang, what an amazing conclusion this was!After that crazy cliffhanger from the previous book, I didn’t know what to expect with this one! It was definitely intense in the beginning, and as the story progressed things really started to come together; truths were revealed, questions were answered, and overall I have to say things wrapped up pretty beautifully! This book had the perfect amount of suspense, fun times, sexy times, and of course, revenge!And the best part of all (IMO) is that although Hadley’s story may have come to an end, there’s still plenty of opportunity to see her and her guys in future books if the author chooses to do so (and I’m crossing all my fingers and toes that she does!). I’m definitely not ready to say goodbye to these characters for good, and I’m dying for more Emilia, Hawk and Wilder too! 😉🤞If you’re looking for a fast-paced, addictive, suspenseful read with twists and turns you won’t see coming, then I HIGHLY recommend this rh, enemies-to-lovers series! 🙌\n\n', '\n\n  OMG! What a thrilling, intense and entertaining finale this was! It had my heart beating rapidly, my palms sweating uncontrollably and my butt on the edge of my seat with anticipation of what Hadley was going to do in order to get her vengeance. Every turn of the page pulled me in deeper making it so hard to let the story go in the end. And what a perfect ending it was!Hadley and her crew of princes will keep you laughing, maybe crying a little and swooning so hard over them. They were sweet and loving when they needed to be and fierce and violent when protecting Hadley.This series is brilliantly written with unbelievable twists and turns throughout that keep you guessing the whole way through, and with phenomenal characters whom we grow to love and some we want to destroy. It’s filled with action, suspense, drama, violence, bloody vengeance and some very sweet and tender moments.I loved this series and I can’t wait to see where this phenomenal author takes us next.\n\n', '\n\n  Wow! What a ride this series has been! I loved how everything wrapped up perfectly.  Hadley and her guys are perfect matches!  Loved the lead into the New series and can’t wait for it. Well done!\n\n']"

  THE INSTANT NEW YORK TIMES AND USA TODAY BESTSELLER!""A stunning story... The ending is ingenious, and it's possible that Benedict has brought to life the most plausible explanation for why Christie disappeared for 11 days in 1926.""—The Washington PostThe New York Times and USA Today bestselling author of The Only Woman in the Room returns with a thrilling reconstruction of one of the most notorious events in literary history: Agatha Christie's mysterious 11-day disappearance in 1926.In December 1926, Agatha Christie goes missing. Investigators find her empty car on the edge of a deep, gloomy pond, the only clues some tire tracks nearby and a fur coat left in the car—strange for a frigid night. Her World War I veteran husband and her daughter have no knowledge of her whereabouts, and England unleashes an unprecedented manhunt to find the up-and-coming mystery author. Eleven days later, she reappears, just as mysteriously as she disappeared, claiming amnesia and providing no explanations for her time away.The puzzle of those missing eleven days has persisted. With her trademark historical fiction exploration into the shadows of the past, acclaimed author Marie Benedict brings us into the world of Agatha Christie, imagining why such a brilliant woman would find herself at the center of such murky historical mysteries.What is real, and what is mystery? What role did her unfaithful husband play, and what was he not telling investigators?Agatha Christie novels have withstood the test of time, due in no small part to Christie's masterful storytelling and clever mind that may never be matched, but Agatha Christie's untold history offers perhaps her greatest mystery of all.Fans of The Secrets We Kept, The Lions of Fifth Avenue, and The Alice Network will enjoy this riveting saga of literary history, suspense, and love gone wrong.Also By Marie Benedict:The Other EinsteinCarnegie's MaidThe Only Woman in the RoomLady Clementine  Read more  ","['5.0 out of 5 stars', '2.0 out of 5 stars', '4.0 out of 5 stars', '2.0 out of 5 stars']","['\nWritten in the vein of Agatha Christie\n', '\nDisappointing\n', '\nImmersive, mysterious, and intriguing!\n', '\nA disappointment\n']","[""\n\n  Marie Benedict has created quite a following of faithful readers by tackling various unjustly neglected, but prominent women of history and science, such as Hedy Lamar, Einstein's wife Mitza Maric, and Clementine Churchill. Now she deals with the most famous author of classic murder mysteries : Agatha Christie, whose personal life proves to have been a mystery in itself. Benedict always relies on a basis of methodical research and then adds to that her own intuition and writing talent to present us with an extremely engaging result: a book hard to put down. This latest novel is written according to the plot design used successfully by Agatha Christie herself, and in this case the cleverly devised plot with its surprising twists and turns makes us doubt and wonder to the very last page. It is a stylistic triumph and a very good read!\n\n"", '\n\n  It read like a pre-teen novel and was super corny. Only made it 70% through and gave up.\n\n', '\n\n  The Mystery of Mrs. Christie is a captivating, colourful interpretation that sweeps you away to England in the early 1900s and into the life of Agatha Christie, from her courtship by Lieutenant Christie to wifehood, motherhood, authorship, and the subsequent investigation into the unaccountable eleven days in 1926 that she was missing.The prose is eloquent and expressive. The characters are well-drawn, complex, and authentic. And the plot, alternating between a Chrisite manuscript detailing her life and her husband’s actions and motivations following her disappearance, is an absorbing tale of life, loss, loneliness, loyalty, aspirations, heartache, retribution, and infidelity.Overall, The Mystery of Mrs. Christie is a vivid, compelling, pensive novel by Benedict that does an exceptional job of highlighting her considerable knowledge and impressive research into this renowned literature figures life as well as a dramatic, somewhat plausible explanation for her still unexplainable disappearance all those years ago.\n\n', '\n\n  Ok. Here is the thing, since this book has been endorsed by Kate Quinn, Lisa Wingate and Stuart Turton and that there are lots of fans of this book, I promise to be very brief.This one failed me at every level.See, that says all.But please, do not let me stop you from reading. Perhaps I’m just a cranky old man (or getting there).Happy reading!Spoiler Alert: there is a single mention of The Murder of Roger Ackroyd where the author reveals the murderer. In my opinion she murdered the book.\n\n']"

If you enjoyed the elegant A Gentleman in Moscow or the engaging Where the Crawdads Sing, or the heart-racing American Dirt, this is going to fall so flat for you. Abby Jimenez is quoted on the back cover of the book saying “probably one of my favourite books of all time.” Yikes. Makes me wonder what else she reads.Here are my issues:1) The story is uninspired - it’s not creative and misses out on the premise of yearly vacations. There’s so much more that could have been built into those flashbacks, especially since the book is 361 pages long. It was actually quite a boring read.2) There is not really any character development. There’s a lot of surface analyzing, but considering the span of over a decade, the characters feel static. And they’re not particularly likeable or memorable either.3) While the writing flows easily, it’s not very elegant. There is a lot of dialogue, and you can tell the author spent a lot of time preparing witty exchanges between her characters. And she does pull it off. But there’s something inorganic and juvenile about it.4) All elements considered, the book feels written for a teen audience and not adults. I cringed several times.In summary, this book is just not inspired, doesn’t have an engaging storyline, and didn’t make me feel anything for either of the main characters. I’m just glad I’m done so I can move on to the next read.And as a measure of comparison, I’m a millennial, and I don’t know a single female friend who would consider this book her favourite summer read or anything close to that.\n\n', '\n\n  The book is missing pages 89-120.

Probably wont buy any more of Emily's books for that reason alone.\n\n"", ""\n\n  Emily Henry has written a perfect romance. Poppy and Alex meet at college orientation and don't really make much of an impression on one another but end up car pooling home to Ohio after school ends. This leads to years of summer trips and a deep and abiding friendship. This homage to When Harry Met Sally is just so beautiful. It's funny and real and emotional. I highly recommend it.\n\n"", '\n\n  If you like romance, which I assume you do as you are looking at this book, you will definitely like this book.

It makes you think about who in the world truly belong together, and about the things we should be making a priority in our lives.

Every Poppy out there deserves an Alex, and every Alex deserves a Poppy.\n\n', ""\n\n  Terrible book. I don't understand the high reviews.

  “A stunningly detailed history . . . from sexy socialite double agents to ‘kill switches’ implanted offshore in the computer chips for our electric grid” (R. James Woolsey, former director of Central Intelligence).   For decades, while America obsessed over Soviet spies, China quietly penetrated the highest levels of government. Now, for the first time, based on numerous interviews with key insiders at the FBI and CIA as well as with Chinese agents and people close to them, David Wise tells the full story of China’s many victories and defeats in its American spy wars.   Two key cases interweave throughout: Katrina Leung, code-named Parlor Maid, worked for the FBI for years even after she became a secret double agent for China, aided by love affairs with both of her FBI handlers. Here, too, is the inside story of the case, code-named Tiger Trap, of a key Chinese-American scientist suspected of stealing nuclear weapons secrets.   These two cases led to many others, involving famous names from Wen Ho Lee to Richard Nixon, stunning national security leaks, sophisticated cyberspying, and a West Coast spy ring whose members were sentenced in 2010. As concerns swirl about US-China relations and the challenges faced by our intelligence community, Tiger Trap provides an important overview from “America’s premier writer on espionage” (The Washington Post Book World).   “Wise’s conclusion is sobering—China’s spying on America is ongoing, current, and shows no signs of diminishing—and his book is a fascinating history of Chinese espionage.” —Publishers Weekly   “A fact-filled inside account, with sources named and no one spared.” —Seymour M.

In the style of other renowned mystery authors, there are many details to notice and characters to keep track of as the unfolding progresses. Even with that effort, there are unexpected twists and turns. I really enjoyed that process.As well I am pleased to read a Canadian author that did not shy away from portraying the Quebecois - L'englais perspective accurately.I recommend this reading experience especially to those who would enjoy a good mystery. On to Book #2.\n\n"", '\n\n  I enjoyed the characters in this book for the most part. The writing seemed a little confusing at first, but then improved somewhat. I will read the next book. I liked that it was not extremely obvious who the murderer was.  I did not feel the character of Yvette Nichol made sense as far as the incompleteness of her interactions with Inspector Gamache. Maybe this will continue in other books. I will read the next and see.  I have yet to determine how a bunch of stick figures in a picture were so recognizable. Did not really make much sense to me.\n\n', '\n\n  Having read some of the other Gamache books and just finished his latest (Kingdom of the Bling), I decided it was time to read the first book - Still Life. Everything is there already - the characters with all their foibles, the village of Three Pines, the insights and analyses, the love and support of a community. And of course the story and the tension and inability to put this down, because you just get drawn into the mystery and drama. A wonderful book - and it doesn’t have to be the first one you read. After all, it’s a Gamache novel! 😀\n\n', '\n\n  My first read. I had to reread the first chapter  3 times as I found it confusing but then it became fluid. A great writer. Born and raised in the Eastern Townships and working in Outremont I had to pretend this was just a fiction since I’m familiar with la rue St Denis not  boulevard and my French is fluent so tried to ignore spelling. Penny’s writing is very involved much like British mystery novelist.  I will certainly read all her series .  Chapeau!!\n\n', '\n\n  Given the good reviews this book has received, I am a minority. It is the first book by this author and it shows. Overall it is like Hercule Poirot meets a bunch of amateur artists in a Norman Rockwell setting.It was somewhat entertaining, but not a page turner for me. Too many annoyances on the way.Starting with the plot. Someone dies, a friend suspects foul play. Instead of calling the cops, she puts a clue into a  painting, shows it to all her friends, one being the murderer, and says that there is a message in the painting. Of course the murderer figures that she suspects and kills her. Then Detective Gamache comes with his team to investigate. Turns out that another painter lady figures out the events and the identity of the murderer before Gamache, so he is eventually required to save her from similar fate.Annoyances abound. First the author overuses metaphors an similes to create interest. To wit, second paragraph of the book:"" ..knelt down, his knees cracking like the report of a hunter\'s rifle"". Two pages later, an editorial aside:"" Every year the hunters shot cows and horses and family pets and each other. And, unbelievably, they sometimes shot themselves, perhaps in a psychotic episode where they mistook themselves for dinner""Yikes - as they sat in French: ""tirée par les cheveux"". The lady obviously does not abide hunting.The premise that a amateur painter would cover the interior walls of her house with murals of the village life is just unbelievably weird, and an unnecessary distraction. So is Det. Gamache\'s interaction with young Agent Nichol, not at all fully developed. Why bother?What I missed the most, was the vision of the village itself. Did not get any sense what it was like geographically, nor architecturally,nor of the overall population. Usually stories benefit from such vision, and also from a sense of the atmosphere of the place, also lacking.I am soon going to read her eighth novel, The Beautiful Mystery, hoping to see progress commensurate with her reputation.BTW, I am wondering what were the editors doing to eliminate the first- book clangers?In the meantime I am reading a mystery by Martin Cruz Smith, who can create scenes from faraway places, with local atmosphere, and compelling characters, from the first page onward . Just as Elizabeth George does. Just sayin\'.\n\n', ""\n\n  I have long heard about Louise Penny, the author who lives in the Eastern Townships not too far from where my mother used to live. After someone recommended that I start with this, the first book, I bought and read  it in a couple of days in August. It's brilliant. I especially love the writing style. As a poet, I find that Ruth's poetry, occasionally and poignantly incorporated into the novel, works incredibly well. Of course, it's a detective and mystery story, and the plot is well crafted, the characters brilliantly developed, and Armand presented as a stable figure, the backbone of these stories. Since August, I have bought and read more in the series.\n\n"", '\n\n  Decided to start the series at the beginning and this one did make me want more.  Gamache was well enough established to make me care about what happened to him.  He seems much like Donna de Leon\'s Brunetti -- a moderately successful middle-aged policeman with enough personal conviction to give him occasional doubts.  Other characters were sketched with fairly broad strokes but when I encounter them again I\'ll recognize them.The ""mystery"" wasn\'t very mysterious, but the supporting cast of suspects, witnesses and groupies was inteeresting enough to make it worth waiting for the Surete to figure it out.  Looking forward to the next one.\n\n', '\n\n  Depuis son passage à l\'émission dominicale ""Tout le monde en parle"", j\'ai été intrigué par Louise Penny. Cette amante du Québec et de ses habitants.

  That awkward moment when an ER doctor has to inform you that you’re pregnant…with his baby. Three things Lynsey Jones knows about the hot doctor: he’s grouchy, an arrogant jerk, and strangely obsessed with pie. Three things Dr. Josh Richardson knows: he doesn’t talk about his past, he doesn’t do relationships, and the crazy girl in the hospital cafeteria who ate a fistful of French silk pie…is annoyingly irresistible. After a chance meetup at a bar and a heated cab ride together, things come to a head and now instead of hating each other, they’re horizontal in a bed. Three months later, the weird cafeteria stalker who crept out of Josh's house like a thief in the night, winds up as his patient in the ER after her Tinder date from hell. The doctor is prepared to keep it cool and professional. That is until her bloodwork reveals that she’s pregnant. What really throws him for a loop…is that the surprise baby…is his.

I don’t care what she writes, I always grab it sight unseen knowing that I will love it no matter what.  Amy’s ability to introduce humour with her witty remarks always gives me gut busters.  To many times, I’m came close to falling off my treadmill laughing so hard. Reading her books always give me a feeling of joy and make a bad day so much better. This romantic comedy, is just terrific and I loved reading it.  The story is about Lindsey and Joshua aka Dr. Dick - yes, the title suits - he is so broken you can’t help but root for him.  Lyndsey is a sweet, loveable, klutz who ends up being Dr. Dick’s assistant, and the best assistant he’s ever had.  Both characters have such depth you soon forget you are reading a story and become part of it and when you can lose yourself in a story, they are the very best.  This is a book a highly recommend and guarantee you will love.

Lynsey is his complete opposite, but there\'s just this undeniable chemistry between them they need to explore. It was so funny to watch their antics.

One Moment Please was a really enjoyable read that\'s for sure!\n\n', ""\n\n  One Moment Please is the third installment in the Wait With Me standalone series. This is the first novel I have read from this author and series and I definitely plan on diving into more.Lynsey and Josh are two strangers who start their relationship with the definition of enemies. They are constantly at each other's throats until Josh insists they share an Uber. One fight leads to some heated tension as they inevitably clash. After Lynsey's quick get away the pair don't cross paths until three months later when Josh the ER doctor has to break the news to Lynsey that she's pregnant…….With his kid. Josh is forced to relive his haunting past as Lynsey struggles to accept her current reality.The synopsis was the first thing that drew me into this book and boy did it not disappoint. From the very beginning of the novel, I was enthralled with the characters. The first couple of chapters makes me laugh harder than I have while reading a book in a very long time. I absolutely loved this story and the slow burn of their relationship had me on edge the entire time. This is by far the best book I have read in months.If you want a laugh-out-loud read with a hot doctor and the perfect amount of smut check out One Moment Please. *Note, Trigger warning.

Hoping to see a book about Dean and the bakery owner!\n\n', '\n\n  Amy Daws is an excellent writer, but I just couldn’t get into this one the same way as I could her Harris Brother series, which I LOVED.This book contains the heart, humour, and heat that readers have come to expect from Amy Daws. All of that was as on point as possible. For me, though, there was simply too much angst in this book. “Dr. Dick” really did come across as a dick sometimes. I also often didn’t like the way Lynsey and Josh treated each other. If someone I were involved with treated me the way they periodically treated each other, I would have been very unimpressed.In the end, I think it comes down to preference. As I said, the book is very well written and likely to appeal to many. I just don’t love tropes that involve people who behave badly (even if it’s due to past trauma) or ones in which people are super attracted to each other, while seeming to actively dislike each other. I don’t go for anything in the “hate sex” sphere. I just can’t get my head around attraction that doesn’t involve at least some element of like and/or respect for the other person.Despite my own lack of love for this book, hats off to Amy Daws for exploring something new. We never know how something will go until we try it. :-)\n\n']"

RH are those romance tropes that are either done really well or are books that contain a lot of group activities but no decent plot. The Boys of Briar Hall is a RH series that has been done really well. The second book answered some of my questions from the first book…but left me with a lot more questions than answers.Ava Jade is a really well written female heroine. I love it when authors write RH and the female is a force to be reckoned with. Ava Jade is a take no prisoners type of female. She is not going to sit around and let these men dictate what she can and cannot do. Stealing the door knobs had to have been one of the best comically written scenes in a RH that I’ve ever read. This female is not someone to be messed with.There is a lot of action packed chapters. This story is not a slow burn. From the very first book, the author is taking us along for a ride and we’re just doing our best to hold on for dear life. Absolutely fantastic book. Cannot wait for the next one.I was provided an advanced reader copy in exchange for an honest review.\n\n', '\n\n  This is one excellent RH read. Ava Jade is a total BA and I want to be her friend! Rook is my #1 but Grey is also awesome and Corvus has his moments. The storyline is action packed and suspense filled with pockets of spice. I am so eager for the next book.\n\n', ""\n\n  I will not be reading the last one. It's very disappointing what happens in the end. Not to mention how difficult Ava is through 8ut the whole book  making mountains out of mole hills.Nobody likes a snitch.\n\n"", '\n\n  What an intense roller coaster ride!  Ava Jade is fierce and untrusting. Can she find a way to fix everything. That ending  though….. wow… can’t wait for the next book. Great series!\n\n', '\n\n  Oh my mother tucking duck....this is an amazing read the story flow is fabulos and I could. Not put it down!!\n\n', '\n\n  I love the characters and her strength. definitely recommend this read. I look forward to finding out more about each character.\n\n', '\n\n  “She was the ember that would ignite us, spurring us into a forest fire that would eat all our enemies away, rendering them to ashes.  We would burn together. She was the catalyst we’d been waiting for.”OMG! Hold on tight because this story is about to blow you away and take you on one hell of a twisted ride of bloody violence and spicy deliciousness! I was riveted to my seat, biting my nails with anticipation and curling my toes from all of the raw desire in every chapter. I never wanted this story to end but when it did OMFG that  ending sucker punched me in the face!Ava Jade is one hell of a MF badass! She is so damn fierce, slightly unhinged and utterly uncontrollable. I love everything about her! The connection that she is slowly forging with the Crows is intense but fragile and could break at any moment. The desire and burning passion that is growing between all of them will have your toes curling and your panties combusting with its intensity and heat! These four are perfect for each other but they all have darkness and demons that they need to destroy in order for Ava Jade to make it past the trials in one piece.There are so many secrets, betrayals and twisted moments throughout that will leave you wondering how this is all going to turn out in the end. It’s one wild rollercoaster ride.This is a well written story with deliciously dark and damaged characters, gut-wrenching emotional moments, twists and turns that will shock you, and an ending that will leave you begging to know what happens next!Highly recommend for all dark romance lovers.\n\n', '\n\n  Picking up where book 1 ended, we are thrust right back into the story. There was a lot more information given and many questions from book one were finally answered. Although there was no shortage of questions after this book.I loved that we began to see the interactions between AJ and the boys change. I felt this book was more about their changing relationships and getting to know them more than moving forward with the plot. There were some new plot points but it was slower than book 1. This didn’t make the book less interesting, it actually made the story developments that occurred mean more.That ending left me needing to know how book 3 will continue the story. It wasn’t really a cliffhanger, more of a “oh this is going to be good.”\n\n']"

  #1 New York Times BestsellerFrom Liane Moriarty, the #1 New York Times bestselling author of Big Little Lies and Nine Perfect Strangers, comes Apples Never Fall, a novel that looks at marriage, siblings, and how the people we love the most can hurt us the deepest.The Delaney family love one another dearly—it’s just that sometimes they want to murder each other . . .If your mother was missing, would you tell the police? Even if the most obvious suspect was your father?This is the dilemma facing the four grown Delaney siblings.The Delaneys are fixtures in their community. The parents, Stan and Joy, are the envy of all of their friends. They’re killers on the tennis court, and off it their chemistry is palpable. But after fifty years of marriage, they’ve finally sold their famed tennis academy and are ready to start what should be the golden years of their lives. So why are Stan and Joy so miserable?The four Delaney children—Amy, Logan, Troy, and Brooke—were tennis stars in their own right, yet as their father will tell you, none of them had what it took to go all the way. But that’s okay, now that they’re all successful grown-ups and there is the wonderful possibility of grandchildren on the horizon.One night a stranger named Savannah knocks on Stan and Joy’s door, bleeding after a fight with her boyfriend. The Delaneys are more than happy to give her the small kindness she sorely needs. If only that was all she wanted.Later, when Joy goes missing, and Savannah is nowhere to be found, the police question the one person who remains: Stan. But for someone who claims to be innocent, he, like many spouses, seems to have a lot to hide. Two of the Delaney children think their father is innocent, two are not so sure—but as the two sides square off against each other in perhaps their biggest match ever, all of the Delaneys will start to reexamine their shared family history in a very new light.

Brilliant and quite sly.\n\n', '\n\n  Remarkable storytelling! Liane’s  ability to weave even the smallest detail into the story in a brilliant way is an incredible feat. This may be her best novel ever… I am always sad when I finish one of her books because I know it will be a considerable amount of time before I am able to read the next one… But it’s worth the wait!\n\n', '\n\n  A compelling read, psychologically savvy and characters to love and a few to, not exactly hate, but be disturbed by.

Enough happy endings to make me glad I read it.\n\n', ""\n\n  I've read all of Liane Moriarty's books, and this one was a bit disappointing.

But this morning is different: last night Elle and her oldest friend Jonas crept out the back door into the darkness and had sex with each other for the first time, all while their spouses chatted away inside. Now, over the next twenty-four hours, Elle will have to decide between the life she has made with her genuinely beloved husband, Peter, and the life she always imagined she would have had with her childhood love, Jonas, if a tragic event hadn’t forever changed the course of their lives. As Heller colors in the experiences that have led Elle to this day, we arrive at her ultimate decision with all its complexity. Tender yet devastating, The Paper Palace considers the tensions between desire and dignity, the legacies of abuse, and the crimes and misdemeanors of families.

She's plucky, she's got a scarred up heart and a beautiful spirit,  and she's pretty brave.  I was drawn in immediately and stayed so to the end.

I felt like the same thing kept happening, Eliana running away, Eliana being kidnapped, Rielle being moody, Rielle torn between Audric and Corien. Over and over. Like I didn’t need multiple love scenes to demonstrate their feelings. I feel like this book could have been half the length or the story could have progressed further. It was a meh for me. I do want to see how it all wraps up given the twist at the end which wasn’t terribly shocking... we’ve been set up for it for sometime. I guess we’ll see in October how it comes together. Hopefully with a better flow.\n\n', ""\n\n  HO. LY. SH*T. I have so many emotions, so many questions, so much chaos in my head right now thanks to this book. I knew full well it would be a roller coaster and end on an epic cliffhanger, as all second books in trilogies do. But I was not prepared for THIS.Let me preface that this is a heavy read. Not just in that the book itself is physically heavy, but it it is emotionally heavy and will leave you worn out. It deals with some rough subjects and while they were handled with care, some moments made me deeply uncomfortable, though they added to the story itself.And what a story it was. Packed with the action and passion I expected, and so filled with twists and turns I thought my brain was going to get whiplash (it probably does have emotional whiplash because I haven't fully processed the ending and refuse to accept certain aspects). It is actually killing me not to discuss the ending in the review, because let's just say the game has changed.The action scenes were intense, explosive, and filled with artistic flourish. The romance and relationships between various characters were among the highlights for me. This definitely caused problems for Rielle, since I swear she had four romances going on at one point. While her story was definitely the most emotional and romantic of the two, I was more hooked on Eliana's story. It progressed amazingly, and the way it ended will leave me haunted for a while. I am seriously not prepared for the finale.FURYBORN swept me off my feet, but KINGSBANE has left me breathless. It's dark, unforgiving, heart-wrenching, and scandalously steamy (seriously, there is so much sex in this book), and I wouldn't have it any other way. Absolutely one of my favourite books of 2019 and a must read for all YA Fantasy and  adult fantasy.\n\n"", '\n\n  Kingsbane is an intricate, complex story set in a detailed world. It demands a lot from the reader but is equally rewarding. It is emotionally involving and often devastating. There is some ambiguity and uncertainty with both the “good” guys and the “bad” guys being capable of great brutality and deception. Even at the end of this second book I’m not completely sure that I know which side is good and which is evil.From the very first chapter of book one in this series, Furyborn, we know that Rielle is going to turn evil and destroy the world. Seeing her as a fairly innocent teen it was hard to imagine how this was possible. Through the first book we began to see glimmers of the mad queen but this comes to a head in Kingsbane. Piece by piece we witness her descent into evil and madness and by the time she throws in completely with the angels it makes perfect sense for her character. Her arrogance and megalomania grow in line with her power and by the time she goes full on mad queen it is no surprise. I even felt a little bit sad for her as everyone she cares about turns their back on her due to her inability to control her great power and anger which leads her to horrific behaviour. Her eventual “snapping” is completely understandable. Awful and disappointing but understandable.Similar to in Furyborn the perspective shifts with each chapter, mostly between Rielle and Eliana, who are separated by 1000 years. While I didn’t find this confusing at all in book one I was ill while reading much of Kingsbane and I found it difficult to follow and keep the two story lines straight, especially after they begin to cross over . Once I was recovered it was not a problem. This was a case of “it’s me not you” and I don’t think that this is an issue with the book itself but be aware that this is two complex stories in one and you need to be on your mental game.The end of Kingsbane is a serious cliff-hanger for both story lines. Eliana’s story had a particularly cruel end and it will be excruciating to wait for the next book. I think I know what happened to cause this huge, terrible ending and I don’t know if it can be redeemed or reversed but I’m sure hoping it can! This whole time travel aspect has blown my mind and apparently the “butterfly effect” is seriously powerful. I’m hoping it can be harnessed for good in the next book. It’s going to be a long, painful wait!Thank you to Sourcebooks Fire for providing an Electronic Advance Reader Copy via NetGalley for review.\n\n']"

A final, top-secret mission to the Moon. Three astronauts in a tiny module, a quarter of a million miles from home. A quarter of a million miles from help. As Russian and American crews sprint for a secret bounty hidden away on the lunar surface, old rivalries blossom and the political stakes are stretched to breaking point back on Earth.

Love this book!\n']","[""\n\n  This was an exciting, thrill-packed Cold War thriller. Its author, Chris Hadfield, imparts his extraordinary knowledge and experience, bringing atmosphere, authenticity, and credibility to the plot. The gripping, action-packed story is infused with science, technology, politics, espionage, space history, murder, and intrigue with vividly drawn believable characters. Author, Chris Hadfield, is a much-decorated Canadian astronaut, a former fighter pilot, engineer,  spacewalker, served in both the American and Russian space programs, and Commander of the International Space Station. Readers who have not followed the history of the Apollo space program and the space stations may recognize Hatfield may recognize him from the video where he played guitar and sang David Bowie's Space Oddity while floating in 0 Gravity in the ISS. This was featured in news reports at the time and can still be viewed on YouTube. He was active in the space program from 1992 until 2013. I find it difficult to categorize this action-packed novel. This is not so much in the science fiction genre but a historical and suspenseful journey into an alternate past involving a fictional journey of Apollo 18 in 1973. The Apollo program actually ended with Apollo 17, but the story imagines what happens on a subsequent mission to the moon. The writing is filled with an overload of scientific detail and technical descriptions that will appeal more to the space enthusiast than to the casual reader of thrillers. However, the story is so suspenseful, intense, action-packed, and cinematic within a plausible, realistic storyline that it should keep most readers entranced. A leading character is Kaz Zemeckis, a flight controller at Houston. He is assigned to oversee the mission of three astronauts to the moon and ensure their safety from Mission Control.  Kaz missed his goal for going into space when he lost an eye in a training accident. Shortly before blast-off, the astronaut in charge dies in an accident, or was it accidental? The leading backup astronaut replaces him. One astronaut is to stay in the vehicle, circle the moon, and await the two walking on the moon's surface. Due to unfortunate circumstances, this will not be the two originally assigned to the task. At the last minute, the scientific exploration is hastily changed into a military one. The Russians have placed a high-resolution spy satellite in orbit and also a moon rover looking for valuable minerals on the surface.  The astronauts are now ordered to disable both items in order to keep the Russians from advancing in the space race. Kaz is suspicious that one of the astronauts is not what he pretends to be. Surrounding him in Mission Control are many real characters whose names I recognized from the past. Also, at the White House are actual historical people, all seamlessly blended into the story. At the end of the book, I was surprised that most of the characters, except for the fictional Kaz, were real people, and the Russian spy satellite and their moon rover were actually in place at the time. In the high-tension storyline, there are startling encounters, dangers galore from the Russians, and one aboard Apollo 18 may be a murderer. Events do not go as planned, and both the Russians and the Americans are determined to retrieve an exotic, rare mineral from the moon. The Russians are angry that Apollo 18 is trying to disable their space equipment. Back at Mission Control, the sheriff and others are helping Kaz investigate the astronaut's backgrounds and try to keep on top of the changing events in space. What will the outcome be? Will the crew of Apollo 18 succeed in their mission and get home safely? Recommended to those who want adventure, history of early space exploration and moon landings, espionage, and find the technical details enhance the reality of this dramatic story. I was glued to the pages, except for a short break to watch Captain Kirk returning from space in Jeff Bezos's space vehicle.\n\n"", '\n\n  Purchased an early pre-order which was supposed to be signed by the author. Just got my book and it’s a regular version, not signed.\n\n', ""\n\n  When I lived in Russia [Moscow] for three years from 2001 to 2004, I ,  a Canadian woman, was briefy a member of CWIM - Canadian Women in Moscow - which was hosted by Mrs Hadfield. [I went on to host a year of International Women's Club at my downtown flat in 2002-2003]. I also briefly saw Commander Hadfield at a hotel 'do', though I was, of course, not yet aware of his near future importance in international developments in space.Because of my admittedly small increased awareness of his activities, I looked forward to buying a copy of Commander Hadfield's novel, 'The Apollo Murders'. I tried to read through the book, but had to stop halfway, enmired in technical detail but not finding much by the way of character and plot development. I cannot recommend the novel.\n\n"", '\n\n  This book was good interweaving of fact and fiction, by an author who actually lived a number of the adventures described.  Only drawback I thought was the minimal depth of character of the sole female in this story (a cosmonaut).  I hope Chris Hadfield considers writing more fiction!\n\n', '\n\n  I have  seen Chris Hadfield on TV many times and have been  impressed by his remarkable skill set. I did wonder however how he would do as a writer of fiction. I was very much impressed with ""The Apollo Murders"" and his attention to detail in describing the workings of a space craft and the ins and outs of day to day life working for NASA. The book unwinds at a very nice pace and as we get to know the main characters we feel part of the myriad of decisions being made on the Apollo  spacecraft and back at Houston. I also loved the Russian connection within the plot and even the fact that not everything works out for the Americans. If I had one criticism it would be to include a few more dangerous adventures/episodes throughout the book even if it meant including less detail about space. I felt I was turning the pages at times waiting for the ""shoe to drop"" only to be teased along until we got to the point the craft was ready to leave the moon and the gun shot was fired. Having said all this I would recommend the book to anyone and look forward to his next effort.\n\n', ""\n\n  Sorry, I didn't make it to the end before beginning another book. It got a bit too technical for me but those into flight etc will love it. I intend to pick it up again because it fascinated me. Have never before realized the complicated machinery and electronics that are involved for one in flight. The author's writing is perfectly executed but writing a mystery involves a rather more taut and direct line from  start to  finish. Doing a mystery novel is not rocket science.\n\n"", '\n\n  This is a real page turner that will appeal to fans of political thrillers and space. Chris Hadfield takes the reader back to the moon landings and the Cold War. Through the characters the reader experience what it’s like to be an astronaut. A great book! I hope there are more novels on the way.\n\n', '\n\n  So well written I hated to put it down. I loved that he shared his fantastic knowledge with us in an interesting way.

As the story gets more complicated it also becomes more and more compelling.  I wasn’t sure what to feel about Drake.  His character is captivating because I I kept yelling at my kindle for the last few books and he finally started acting like a human with feelings.

This tale is such a perfect representation of the Four Horsemen, I couldn't put it down. I would never chose between the four men, but Drake was probably my absolute favourite character. There's just something so romantic and dark about him. Scarlett was also an amazing character with so many complexities that you can't help but fall in love with her and the boys.

She needs to remember just who the men really are and how she fits into their lives and he's the only one who can get her there.

  A New York Times Notable Book, a Barack Obama favorite, selected as a Top 10 Book of the Year by Fresh Air, Time, and Entertainment Weekly, and a Best Book of the Year by Goodreads Choice Awards, the Associated Press, and many more “If you’re looking for a superb novel, look no further.” —The Washington Post  The instant New York Times bestseller and finalist for the 2021 National Book Award is “wildly inventive, a humane and uplifting book for adults that’s infused with the magic of childhood reading experiences” (The New York Times Book Review).  From the Pulitzer Prize–winning author of All the Light We Cannot See, perhaps the most bestselling and beloved literary fiction of our time, comes Cloud Cuckoo Land.Set in Constantinople in the fifteenth century, in a small town in present-day Idaho, and on an interstellar ship decades from now, Anthony Doerr’s gorgeous third novel is a triumph of imagination and compassion, a soaring story about children on the cusp of adulthood in worlds in peril, who find resilience, hope—and a book. In Cloud Cuckoo Land, Doerr has created a magnificent tapestry of times and places that reflects our vast interconnectedness—with other species, with each other, with those who lived before us, and with those who will be here after we’re gone.  Thirteen-year-old Anna, an orphan, lives inside the formidable walls of Constantinople in a house of women who make their living embroidering the robes of priests. Restless, insatiably curious, Anna learns to read, and in this ancient city, famous for its libraries, she finds a book, the story of Aethon, who longs to be turned into a bird so that he can fly to a utopian paradise in the sky. This she reads to her ailing sister as the walls of the only place she has known are bombarded in the great siege of Constantinople. Outside the walls is Omeir, a village boy, miles from home, conscripted with his beloved oxen into the invading army. His path and Anna’s will cross.  Five hundred years later, in a library in Idaho, octogenarian Zeno, who learned Greek as a prisoner of war, rehearses five children in a play adaptation of Aethon’s story, preserved against all odds through centuries. Tucked among the library shelves is a bomb, planted by a troubled, idealistic teenager, Seymour. This is another siege. And in a not-so-distant future, on the interstellar ship Argos, Konstance is alone in a vault, copying on scraps of sacking the story of Aethon, told to her by her father. She has never set foot on our planet.  Like Marie-Laure and Werner in All the Light We Cannot See, Anna, Omeir, Seymour, Zeno, and Konstance are dreamers and outsiders who find resourcefulness and hope in the midst of gravest danger. Their lives are gloriously intertwined. Doerr’s dazzling imagination transports us to worlds so dramatic and immersive that we forget, for a time, our own. Dedicated to “the librarians then, now, and in the years to come,” Cloud Cuckoo Land is a beautiful and redemptive novel about stewardship—of the book, of the Earth, of the human heart. From the National Book Award finalist citation: “From the 15th century to the future, the five protagonists in Anthony Doerr’s brilliant Cloud Cuckoo Land come together astonishingly in the stories they make of their lives, rewritten by time and circumstance. This marvelous book is like an astrolabe or an armillary sphere; a navigation instrument engineered to discover the world. Urgent, rife with relevance and compassion, Doerr’s novel affirms the necessity of the made thing, the capacious imagination, and storytelling.”   Read more  ","['1.0 out of 5 stars', '5.0 out of 5 stars', '4.0 out of 5 stars', '5.0 out of 5 stars', '1.0 out of 5 stars', '4.0 out of 5 stars', '4.0 out of 5 stars', '5.0 out of 5 stars']","[""\nCouldn't finish it\n"", '\nMy new favourite book!!!\n', '\nexhausting timeline\n', '\nJust wonderful\n', '\nhard to follow\n', '\nVery different novel!

Is it only supposed to come together in the end?  I was so bored by this leaping around from character to character, with no clear story or time period to support them, I couldn't finish the book.  Note to the author: if you want to see a good example of this construction, read The Lincoln Highway by Amor Towles. He uses that same single-character-chapter conceit except he does it elegantly.\n\n"", ""\n\n  I have never had so much trouble putting a book down!! It seemed confusing and random at first but it all gets expertly tied together. I felt a connection to all of the characters.

He makes it work, the history is interesting, but basically the timeline gimmicks were just annoying.\n\n', '\n\n  One of the best books I have read. This book should be taught. It’s a remarkable story and an extraordinary achievement by Anthony Doerr\n\n', '\n\n  I gave up after 80 pages\n\n', '\n\n  Very different novel! But very entertaining\n\n', '\n\n  First of all, this book is meant to be savoured, not devoured. At 650 pages, it’s better enjoyed in small bites over a long period much like a multicourse Italian family dinner. Doerr is not serving up McDonald’s fast food. Much like the importance of heading to a big dinner with an appetite, empty your head of all preconceived ideas and learn to go with the flow while appreciating Doerr’s talent. Accept what is being presented, knowing that ALL the pieces will tie together and make sense later. Frustration awaits if you ignore the suggestions!At the core of this book is the concept of stewardship – of books, of the planet, and of each other’s heart. To showcase this concept, Doerr will transport you to 15th century Constantinople with Anna and Omeir, to Idaho in the present time with Seymour and Zeno, and to a foreign future with Konstance. All five dreamers on the edge of society are trying to make sense of the world around them and, as a result, come to rely on their resourcefulness and hope. Doerr showcases the power of a story through the ages as each come in contact with and are united by the fictional ancient manuscript, Cloud Cuckoo Land, by Antonius Diogenes.This Herculean effort, 7 years in the writing, spans three narratives and thousands of years. Written to remind us of the importance of stories and their power to unite, this literary wonder needs to be on your radar. Put yourself in the right frame of mind and look up the definition of the title before allowing Doerr to sweep you away!I was generously gifted this advance copy by Anthony Doerr, Simon and Schuster Canada and NetGalley and was under no obligation to provide a review.\n\n', ""\n\n  I ended this book with a sigh and a silence - wow! What a masterpiece! How can I describe the impressions that chased each other throughout my experiencing this book?The varying timeliness and different protagonists lent the nature of a vibrant kaleidoscope to this novel. The present tense used by Doerr, and which mostly doesn't work towards my reading pleasure, was in this instance transformed to the opposite. It gave an urgency to the actions, a depth to feelings never named but vividly transmitted to the reader. The prose is unorthodox and immensely captivating. Thus, I cried for and with Omeir (my favourite character) and deeply empathised with Seymour and his almost palpable pain and rage. I was saddened by Zeno who played it safe for most of his life and almost escaped living that way - almost... I cheered on Konstance's sleuthing in her desperate attempt to save herself from despair. I felt deeply for little Anna whose determined search for knowledge and desperate, courageous attempts to help led to disaster and also to some miracles. Their anxieties and fears became mine, as did their triumphs. And the world and life truly are Janus-faced, beautiful and terrible at once.I enjoyed this book slowly, savouring it, in spite of my intense urge to read on, just a little more, just one more chapter. I will read it again, even more slowly, and I am sure that I'll discover even more then.This is a must read, not a recommendation, but an urging.My sincere thanks to Scribner for this compelling eARC; the opinions in this review are my own.\n\n""]"

From body lotion to tonic water, the popular new element shines bright. Meanwhile, hundreds of girls toil amidst the glowing dust of the radium-dial factories. The glittering chemical covers their bodies from head to toe; they light up the night like industrious fireflies. With such a coveted job, these ""shining girls"" are the luckiest alive — until they begin to fall mysteriously ill. And, until they begin to come forward.As the women start to speak out on the corruption, the factories that once offered golden opportunities ignore all claims of the gruesome side effects. And as the fatal poison of the radium takes hold, the brave shining girls find themselves embroiled in one of the biggest scandals of America's early 20th century, and in a groundbreaking battle for workers' rights that will echo for centuries to come. A timely story of corporate greed and the brave figures that stood up to fight for their lives, these women and their voices will shine for years to come.Written with a sparkling voice and breakneck pace, The Radium Girls fully illuminates the inspiring young women exposed to the ""wonder"" substance of radium, and their awe-inspiring strength in the face of almost impossible circumstances.

It is well researched and based on facts but the stories of the women dial painters was presented from a very personal point of view and brought to the forefront the true scope of this catastrophe for them and for their families.  It is hard to imagine how much courage they had to fight the ""corrupt corporation""  to acknowledge the reality of radium poisoning as a disease that exhibits itself in many ways.  The few dentists, doctors and lawyers who tried to help, were up against a ""well-oiled"" team of corporate managers, lawyers and doctors who were on the company payroll and spread their lies to the employees and the public.  This is such an important story and so many of the Occupational Health & Safety workplace guidelines that are now in place today began with the fight of these desperate and courageous women who were denied safety in their workplace.\n\n', '\n\n  This book was heartbreaking. The true story of the girls who painted radium pieces for dials, clocks and watches during WWI, the 20s and 30s. Many of them were very young when they started (as young as 13!) Most of them died young as well. The suffering they endured was unbearable and the battle they fought was incredible. Their story resonates through to today, with occupational health and safety legislation becoming more comprehensive as a result of their battle and sacrifice.Beyond the health and safety aspect, the experuence of these unfortunate women illustrates other issues as well - the gender disparity (if they were men, the problem would have been addressed much more quickly), the plight of the working poor, the lack of affordable medical care, and the callousness of the industrial employers.This book was well written, extremely well annotated, and, I suggest, very comprehensive.  I highly recommend it.\n\n', '\n\n  I remember growing up in the 1940s and 1950s, the radium dial watches we all used to wear and the radium dial clocks we all had in our houses and we just took this for granted and then all of a sudden we didn’t have them anymore. It wasn’t till about 10 years ago that I looked up on Wikipedia as to what happened and then realized the thing about radioactivity. I didn’t really think they use real radium in the watches and lo and behold they did! The story about how  The radium corporation and government branches ignored the information in this included the American medical Association for years and years is quite amazing! And quite angering. Once again, society and man ignored the women’s complaints and resolutions. Wonderful read\n\n', ""\n\n  I had only a vague knowledge about the subject of these girls.Its an absorbing and painful read how thesewomen suffered and how barely no one was listening and came to their defense until it was much too late.The writer has done her research and the women's stories are presented in a very engaging way.So much ignorance and harm was dealt these women...radium being hailed as a 'wonder drug' to manyailments in those days  is shocking indeed!A page turner and highly recommended.\n\n"", ""\n\n  This is simply the most amazing story I have ever read,and it's TRUE! I could not put this book down. Right from the beginning the author brought me into the lives of these girls who became victims of one of the most horrendous crimes of the century.....but they triumphed for humanity at great personal cost. These women are heroes! Bravo!!!\n\n"", '\n\n  What an amazing story this book holds. What this girls suffered through and fought against is unbelievable. They changed industry safety and scientific knowledge of radiation and we should all be grateful to them. Easy 5 stars, although not easy to read about their suffering.\n\n', '\n\n  Absolutely fascinating account of big business vs. the little guy. Set in a time when women were considered disposable commodities by employers and their concerns for their safety ""hysterical reactions"". Tells it from the women\'s point of view in an age where women didn\'t count.\n\n', '\n\n  I would. Recommend this book to everyone who enjoys reading.  It has taken me longer to get through this book as I had to go back and read some of it over again The terrible pain these women went through was just a horror and their employers were absolute beasts and liars.I am very pleased that there is a memorial to these women,they deserve it.\n\n']"

  A recent study revealed that only 21 percent of workers feel engaged and truly committed to their company’s success and goals. They don’t know how their work connects to their company’s goals or understand how they can help achieve them. Leaders have failed to fully engage workers in the development and execution of their company’s mission and goals, and ultimately its journey toward success. Too often, employees are over-managed and under-led.Jude Rake, a business leader with more than 35 years of experience leading high-performance teams, shows how servant leaders—those who serve employees by giving them what they need to fully engage and commit to achieving the company’s goals—use nine proven principles to succeed:Grow leaders and difference makers, not just followers.Build and orchestrate high-performance teams more powerful than the sum of their parts.Focus the organization on strategic priorities, simplify operations, and accelerate progress.Champion the people who purchase and use your products and services.Cultivate a performance-based culture of innovation.Communicate relentlessly.See the world through the eyes of others.Be the model you want emulated.Coach people to achieve more than they thought possible.The Bridge to Growth details how to use these principles to elevate workforce engagement, collaboration, innovation, and accountability to build a bridge from strategy to exceptional execution and results.

  From the acclaimed award-winning author Emmanuel Carrère, Lives Other Than My Own: A Memoir is an act of generous imagination that unflinchingly records devastating loss and, equally vividly, the wealth of human solace that follows in its wake.Selected by the New York Times as one of the 50 Best Memoirs of the Past 50 YearsIn Sri Lanka, a tsunami sweeps a child out to sea, her grand-father helpless against the onrushing water. In France, a young woman succumbs to illness, leaving her husband and small children bereft. Present at both events, Emmanuel Carrère sets out to tell the story of two families—shattered and ultimately restored. What he accomplishes is nothing short of a literary miracle: a heartrending narrative of endless love, a meditation on courage and decency in the face of adversity, an intimate and reverent look at the extraordinary beauty and nobility of ordinary lives.Precise, sober, and suspenseful, as full of twists and turns as any novel, Lives Other Than My Own confronts terrifying catastrophes to illuminate the astonishing richness of human connection: a grandfather who thought he had found paradise—too soon—and now devotes himself to helping his neighbors rebuild their village; a husband so in love with his ailing wife that he carries her in his arms like a knight does his princess; and finally, Carrère himself, longtime chronicler of the tormented self, who unexpectedly finds consolation and even joy as he immerses himself in the lives of others.“Moving…Carrère’s prose is precise and measured…Through interviews with friends and relatives of both families, he creates powerful portraits that celebrate ordinary lives.”—The New Yorker“You begin this memoir thinking it will be about one thing, and it turns into something else altogether—a book at once more ordinary and more extraordinary than any first impressions might allow.”—The New York Times  Read more  ","['5.0 out of 5 stars', '1.0 out of 5 stars', '4.0 out of 5 stars']","['\nBeautiful and Originally written\n', '\nUnpleasant experience.\n', '\nresilience after loss\n']","['\n\n  Probably one of the most beautifully-crafted yet unselfconscious memoirs I have ever read.

This was a girl who strapped herself with weapons to go for a run who gets flustered around men. I also didn't like how every time she had a moment of PTSD just she assumed the brothers would want to cut her out of their lives. At the beginning it was understandable but towards the end it became repetitive and a bit annoying.I think that the first book was a lot of world building.

  In this relaunch of the electrifying, landmark #1 bestselling thriller series, chief medical examiner Dr. Kay Scarpetta hunts those responsible for two wildly divergent and chilling murders. Forensic pathologist Kay Scarpetta has come almost full circle, returning to Virginia as the chief medical examiner, the state where she launched her storied career. Finding herself the new girl in town once again after being away for many years, she’s inherited not only an overbearing secretary, but also a legacy of neglect and potential corruption.She and her husband Benton Wesley, now a forensic psychologist with the U.S. Secret Service, have relocated to Old Town Alexandria where she’s headquartered five miles from the Pentagon in a post-pandemic world that’s been torn by civil and political unrest. Just weeks on the job, she’s called to a scene by railroad tracks where a woman’s body has been shockingly displayed, her throat cut down to the spine, and as Scarpetta begins to follow the trail, it leads unnervingly close to her own historic neighborhood.At the same time, a catastrophe occurs in a top-secret laboratory in outer space, endangering at least two scientists aboard. Appointed to the highly classified Doomsday Commission that specializes in sensitive national security cases, Scarpetta is summoned to the White House and tasked with finding out exactly what happened. But even as she works the first potential crime scene in space remotely, an apparent serial killer strikes again very close to home.   Read more  ","['5.0 out of 5 stars', '2.0 out of 5 stars', '3.0 out of 5 stars', '5.0 out of 5 stars', '4.0 out of 5 stars']","['\nGreat author!!

Forensic pathologist Kay Scarpetta has come almost full circle, returning to Virginia as the chief medical examiner, the state where she launched her storied career.""And you know what? I really enjoyed it and am back on board with this series.The same cast of characters is present, Kay, her Secret Service forensic psychologist husband Benton, her niece Lucy and my personal favorite - Pete Marino. The relationship between Kay and Marino was contentious in the beginning of the series, but I\'m happy with where Cornwell has taken Marino in this latest. He\'s a valuable resource instead of being portrayed as a thorn in her side. However there is a new thorn in the side character. Kay has inherited a secretary who is loyal to her old boss and quite resentful of Kay. Kay has the same analytical mind. Cornwell keeps the characters moving forward in real time, with the successes and sadness that living life brings.The \'back to basics\' has Kay investigating the death of a young woman found on the railroad tracks. This crime very much reminded me of the earlier books. Political machinations and corruption abounds at a number of levels in this latest, stretching as far as outer space! Kay is called in to examine a remote site. There\'s yet another thread that I\'ll let you discover.I chose to listen to this latest. The reader was award winning narrator Susan Ericksen. She has read previous Scarpetta books, so the continuity is nice. Her voice is perfect for the mental image I\'ve created for Scarpetta. Her diction is clear, easy to understand, well enunciated and pleasant. The speed of speaking was a bit slow for me, so I sped things up two notches, using the speed adjuster on my device. She provides different voices for the characters, each easily identifiable. Ericksen conveys the emotions of the characters and the action and suspense of the plot with her voice. A great performance.I did find the ending a bit rushed and a slightly too pat, but I quite enjoyed this \'relaunch\' of this series. The door has been left open for number 26 - and I for one will be picking it up.\n\n', '\n\n  I’ve read all the Kay Scarpetta books and enjoyed all of them. This one was ok….I’m glad I read it but was disappointed with a few aspects. The part involving the space murders was awkward and really was completely unrelated to the rest of the plot. The idea that an autopsy could be done in that way was a bit science fiction. I’m glad Marino was back and not portrayed like an incompetent fool. The ending was very anti climactic. I was expecting a bigger mystery to be solved. More focus on her job and the solving of suspicious deaths makes for a better story line.\n\n']"

  A New York Times Notable Book. A literary exploration that is “surely destined to become the quintessential companion to Camus’s most enduring novel” (PopMatters).  The Stranger is a rite of passage for readers around the world. Since its publication in France in 1942, Camus’s novel has been translated into sixty languages and sold more than six million copies. It’s the rare novel that’s as likely to be found in a teen’s backpack as in a graduate philosophy seminar. If the twentieth century produced a novel that could be called ubiquitous, The Stranger is it.   How did a young man in his twenties who had never written a novel turn out a masterpiece that still grips readers more than seventy years later? With Looking for The Stranger, Alice Kaplan tells that story. In the process, she reveals Camus’ achievement to have been even more impressive—and more unlikely—than even his most devoted readers knew.   “To this new project, Kaplan brings equally honed skills as a historian, literary critic, and biographer . . . Reading The Stranger is a bracing but somewhat bloodless experience. Ms. Kaplan has hung warm flesh on its steely bones.” —The New York Times   “For American readers, few French novels are better known, and few scholars are better qualified than Kaplan to reintroduce us to it . . . Kaplan tells this story with great verve and insight, all the while preserving the mystery of its creation and elusiveness of its meaning.” —Los Angeles Review of Books   “The fascinating story behind Albert Camus’ coldblooded masterpiece . . . A compelling companion to a novel that has stayed strange.” —Kirkus Reviews  Read more  ","['5.0 out of 5 stars', '5.0 out of 5 stars']","['\nFinding The Stranger\n', '\nFive Stars\n']","['\n\n  This biography of Camus\'s masterpiece, The Stranger, provides fascinating insight into the constellation of political, personal, and everyday factors that combined to produce the book and see it through publication during the Second World War. Kaplan succeeds in finding ""the stranger"", which is a discovery towards the very end of the book that will quell the curiousity of many readers. I also appreciate her readings of the multitude of artistic homages to The Stranger, particularly her contention that The Cure\'s 1984 song ""Killing an Arab"" is one of the best encapsulations of this sublime, absurd, and thoroughly modern tale.\n\n', '\n\n  Great book.\n\n']"

What did Vonnegut do after Slaughterhouse Five, his iconic masterpiece set in wartime Dresden? He produced book after book, all as good if not better than Slaughterhouse Five. He did not let the success of Slaughterhouse Five damper his creative energy. In Mandel’s case, Station Eleven, her fourth novel, was a blockbuster, translated into thirty-five languages. How could she top that success? Wasn’t Station Eleven the pinnacle of success for Mandel? It appears not. Like Vonnegut, I can see Mandel continuing to produce opus after opus without consideration of past successes. Mandel is not one to rest on her laurels. The Glass Hotel is as good if not better than Station Eleven although the comparison is difficult because The Glass Hotel is in an entirely different genre than Station Eleven. Station Eleven is a dystopian drama with a hopeful ending whereas The Glass Hotel is in a genre difficult to pinpoint. I’m not sure in what section of the bookstore this book belongs. Is it a crime drama, a thriller, a cautionary tale? It’s all of those and maybe more.In The Glass Hotel, Mandel taunts us with her masterful foretelling just as she did in her previous novels. Mandel has the ability to take us to a peak of intensity before laying down a seemingly random insight into the future leading us into a crescendo of resolution. In this novel Mandel weaves in and out of a metaphysical world that connects her characters in a web of intrigue and of consummate dissatisfaction. Most of her characters we might consider losers. Certainly, most of them are so bent on living a comfortable life that they are willing to invest all of themselves and their life savings in a Ponzi scheme run by a charming narcissist who convinces them that their lives and money are safe with him. Of course, they are mostly oblivious to the dangers involved in the kind of investment offered to them, but frankly, most of them are willing to turn a blind eye to the possibility of danger by the promise of wealth and glory. Some are not and become complicit themselves in the Ponzi. It was hard for me to relate to any of the characters although aspects of each of their personalities have attractive qualities suggesting that they are real humans engaged in real human activity. So, in fact, I could relate to all the characters in a limited sense.  Not all the characters in the book are Ponzi involved. The ones that aren’t are flawed in their own ways, but they are also on personal quests to find the peaceful life. By the end of the book we learn that all the characters, the ones that haven’t died, have adapted to their circumstances and carry on with life. I love the way Mandel grounds her characters in place yet lets them wander in and out of place, sometimes with unpleasant results, sometimes with a sense of inevitability. She includes a number of sub-plots in the development of her main plot yet they are all connected to the core of the novel and to the main characters. These sub-plots tell a rich story. I am particularly attracted to Olivia’s story. Maybe it’s because she is an artist struggling in a commercial and nasty world.I don’t want to give away any of the delicious story of The Glass Hotel, so I have avoided mentioning specific characters and their roles in the book. I leave you to discover those for yourselves.The Glass Hotel is a sensitive and essentially voyeuristic romp through the lives of a number of flawed characters, each with their own set of redeeming qualities, some more veiled than others. The way I judge any book I read, fiction or non-fiction is in my reluctance to put it down. I found The Glass Hotel difficult to put down. I read it well into the night, uncharacteristically for me, I can assure you of that!. I strongly recommend The Glass Hotel. It has superb plot development, a fascinating cast of sometimes endearing, sometimes despicable characters, and it is also a cautionary tale and a lesson in caveat emptor along with an exploration into the psychology of wishful thinking. Finally, it offers hope in the resilience some people demonstrate in the face of grievous loss.  Get the book. Read it.\n\n', '\n\n  After just a few brief sittings with The Glass Hotel, I’m thoroughly absorbed by its sharply-developed characters, delightfully subtle clues, and suspenseful plot.My only wish is that the publisher had done a better job of proofreading: I’ve already found a handful of minor punctuation errors that should have been spotted. (Sorry, I’m an ESL prof who notices these things despite my best efforts to look past them.)I’m looking forward to exploring more of Mandel’s work.\n\n', ""\n\n  This book is exquisitely written, absorbing and compelling. Mandel's writing here feels slightly surreal, like it's wrapped in a gauzy haze, but the story itself is fully grounded in reality. A story of corruption, greed and immense wealth. Every word is a puzzle piece that brings together a diverse cast of characters, developing their connections to one another in exquisite detail.\n\n"", '\n\n  Too many twists and turns. Too many characters and I had difficulty keeping tack if them all.  Wry hokey in parts.\n\n', ""\n\n  Was expecting a mystery/thriller but it wasn't really. The ending for me just added more questions. Overall a bit disappointed but still enjoyed it.\n\n"", ""\n\n  I'm not very far into it and I find I am not interested in reading about teenage angst, drug taking, pshychiatric sessions, and the like.  I have three options 1. Stick with it hoping I might find some redeeming feature. 2. Skip through it. 3 Quit and move on.\n\n"", ""\n\n  Glass Hotel was not over written.Financial crimes and personal family history were realistic.Characters were charismatic and intriguing.Master story telling and held reader's interest with well readen plot and characters.\n\n"", '\n\n  I liked how all the various settings in this story  all related to each other eventually, and kept you reading to find the result of all the relationships.

The examples are beyond useless and only create more space for this shallow thinking for the readers. For example, if you\'re trying to showcase the power of positive thinking, maybe don\'t use an example of getting more money, and focus on how they can cultivate happiness within themselves that don\'t require money or ""things"" to make them happy - a basic concept of cultivating happiness.Just an outright awful book on so many levels.

A time of disease, fear and paranoia as we all head into the dark tunnel of a dystopian future where nothing can ever be assumed or taken for granted anymore.\n\n', '\n\n  British author Panayotis Cacoyannis was born and grew up in Cyprus, studied Law at Oxford, and then moved to London and qualified to practice at the Bar. The Legal landscape was not to his liking so he changed careers and entered Art School. Winning a Degree in Fine Art, and an MA in Painting from the Royal College of Art, he spent his next years painting and sculpting. Another career step directed him to courses in Creative Writing. So in his debut novel THE DEAD OF AUGUST he tossed in all prior experience and out came a novel that is a delight to read on many levels. Cacoyannis seems to have a penchant for satire and parody and has absorbed that inherently British sense of comedy touched with Cyprian flavors that makes his writing not only entertaining but lightens our own lives a bit - seeing how absurdity just may be the best medicine for surviving at the moment! Much the same can be said about his subsequent novels – BOWL OF FRUIT (1907), POLK, HARPER & WHO, FINGER OF AN ANGEL, THE MADNESS OF GRIEF, and now THE COLDNESS OF OBJECTS - only now the increasing sophistication of how Panayotis dissects ‘one man’s lonely rebellion and journey to courage, after early loss and a life of withdrawal and isolation’ (from the author’s words) makes his work even more impressive.Panayotis sculpts figures – his characters – with such polish that in but a few words we are able to visualize and appreciate them. Example, as we meet Anthony Rubens: ‘In the exquisite comfort of his favourite armchair – an original, and signed, 1960s Amoeba – Mr Rubens contemplated his surroundings with pleasure. He was a man of impeccable taste, if he sad so himself: a real connoisseur. One leg crossed over the other, rather sprawled in the vastness of this singular piece of design, he basked in the warm, affectionate light of the fiberglass lamp that loomed overhead, suspended from the ceiling by invisible threads. Mr Rubens held his cup in mid-air in a satisfied reverie as if to savour the moment for longer, though precisely what moment he savoured, and why, Mr Rubens would have found it hard to describe…’ And very subtly we discover Mr Rubens is a gay man  simply by the author’s exceptional use of descriptive language.The story, so very successful on many levels, is condensed as follows: ‘London 2030. When a postman knocks on his door, the news he delivers will cause 70-year-old Anthony Pablo Rubens to reflect on all the sadnesses and joys of the past, while he begins to prepare for the surprises of the future. The past still revolves around the moment in the summer of 1984 when young Anthony first realized he had fallen in love. The present is a Kafkaesque nightmare worse than Orwell\'s 1984, ""a hideous world where people don\'t need to be watched by Big Brother."" It\'s a world that Anthony has mostly shut his eyes to, but which suddenly he is forced to confront. And the future now encompasses the mystery, and excitement, and dread of a day as an exhibit at the National People\'s Museum.’With this particularly fine novel Panayotis Cacoyannis confirms his accelerating status as a major author. He simply just gets better with each book. Highly recommended. Grady Harp, March 21\n\n']"

Love is a universal construct that exists cross-culturally, though it's definition is not always the same.All you have to do is google love, and you'll have thousands upon thousands of entries to get you started. If you're me, it means you spent the last 2 hours reading a bunch of that. It also means you just saw a mouse in the house, temporarily freaked out, and are now sitting with no feet anywhere near the ground.My mouse hunt revealed they're exiting under the kitchen door which means as soon as it's all sealed for the winter, no more mice.So by 8am tomorrow. NO MORE mice, but I digress.Okay, so this review might end up longer than all the rest. It is called Loch Ness Reviews for a reason.Where were we?Oh right, a definition of Love. It's something which Storm's book showcases. There are different kinds, they can develop slowly or at first sight. It can be scary, warm and fuzzy, and it can hurt as much as it can bring joy. Love makes us miserable, ecstatic, jealous, kind and comforting. The book follows two people's lives and how they become intertwined with family, friends and loss.As a good university student would to (which I'm not anymore, arguably I was not a great student either...  ), I'll showcase for you, a definition of love according to The Oxford Dictionary Online.Definition of LoveFrom the Oxford Dictionary Onlinenoun[mass noun]1a strong feeling of affection:babies fill parents with intense feelings of lovetheir love for their countrya strong feeling of affection and sexual attraction for someone:they were both in love with herwe were slowly falling in loveaffectionate greetings conveyed to someone on one's behalf:give her my lovea formula for ending an affectionate letter:take care, lots of love, Judy2a great interest and pleasure in something:his love for footballwe share a love of music3 [count noun] a person or thing that one loves:she was the love of his lifetheir two great loves are tobacco and whiskyBritish informal a friendly form of address:it's all right, love(a love) informal used in affectionate requests:don't fret, there's a love4(in tennis, squash, and some other sports) a score of zero; nil:love fifteen[apparently from the phrase play for love (i.e. the love of the game, not for money); folk etymology has connected the word with French l'oeuf 'egg', from the resemblance in shape between an egg and a zero]verb[with object]feel deep affection or sexual love for (someone):do you love me?like or enjoy very much:I'd love a cup of teaI just love dancingHaving had my share of relationships, non-relationships, questionable relationships and well lets just call some of them mistakes, I wondered what I would learn from this book about love that I didn't already know.The answer? Well I knew most of it already, but I did learn that there are some pretty decent ways to deal with loss and love and mistakes. The book deals with romantic love, parental love, compassionate and friendly love. The love between partners, family and soul mates. It also deals with the loss of all of those. It's a terribly sad and heart wrenching story, it's also simultaneously up lifting and joyous. There's peace at the end, even though there's also loss.Life goes on, and while Daly suffers from the loss of her cheating boyfriend, true love and a lasting partnership sneak up behind her.He hadn't had his flute out for a while either.They really do say that line about the sweet spot and not having his flute out for a while in that episode (s05e25). (In first person of course, I believe he says 'I haven't had my flute out in a long time.') Go ahead gafaw. I do.To prove a point though, Picard's flute makes two important debuts in the Star Trek TNG series. One, above involves Picard taking his flute out again, after not having played for a very long time. He falls in love with an enchanting 'lady', and while they don't make it and ultimately aren't right for each other, they have their time. It's a little like Daly and her cheating boyfriend except Picard isn't an ass, and there's no cheating.In the other flute episode, we see a much different side of Picard's love.In the first flute episode, Picard becomes the victim of a time well let's call it a time-issue. The planet he ends up on isn't the same as the ship's time in orbit. So after much confusion and what is on the surface of the planet a life-time, Picard learns to love his family.Hi family thinks he's just been sick, he knows he's from a 'star-ship' in the sky. He gives up and learns to love life and his 'new' family and play music. Of course, he's rescued by the end of the episode, and loses what for him has been a lifetime with a family, children and grandchildren.Who cares about Star Trek? Well clearly me, but mostly because it illustrates a point. A Colorful Life is epic in the same way that Star Trek was. It tells a timeless story that shows us we all suffer, and we are all human. Just like Star Trek, A Colorful Life doesn't give us a magic answer. It simply suggests that we live life with no regrets, and we try to be as true to ourselves a possible.Caveat: In my head I just had the terrible conversation with myself that took that in a whole different direction, because flutes are rather phallic. Then I decided to re-evaluate archetypes, then I decided maybe I'm Guinan...I do like bald men, and I Do have that hair, and I've always wanted to be 'special'. I'm pretty sure Guinan had her s*** together. I want to be like Daly the same way I'd like to have Guinan powers.I've read all of Melissa Storm's books to date. I've even read all her children's books. She has a gift. She can take words, form them into stories for children, young-adults and adults. Those stories all have a message of peace and love, and they don't ignore all the bad s*** that happens to people either. She opens up the story so the reader can identify with the characters in much the same way mass pop culture identified with the star trek actors and characters. (I swear there are normal people who like star trek out there.)Yes, that's rather crass, but there's a lot of bad-s*** going down everywhere. All you have to do is open up a newspaper, or go online to any news source.Melissa Storm's writing while at times sad and painfully real still leave us with a glimmer of hope.

Daly has lost her beloved father to cancer and her mother to grief, she has no friends and only works on her art portfolio to get into art school.

But life is not always happily ever after and there are many bumps for Daly to navigate, from his parent’s disapproval, the damaged relationship with her mother, and loss of loved ones.

  Andrzej Sapkowski, winner of the World Fantasy Award for Life Achievement, created an international phenomenon with his groundbreaking epic fantasy series, The Witcher. Blood of Elves is the first novel in the saga that inspired the Netflix show and the hit video games.For over a century, humans, dwarves, gnomes, and elves have lived together in relative peace. But times have changed, the uneasy peace is over, and now the races are fighting once again. The only good elf, it seems, is a dead elf.Geralt of Rivia, the cunning hunter known as the Witcher, has been waiting for the birth of a prophesied child. This child has the power to change the world for good—or for evil.As the threat of war hangs over the land and the child is hunted for her extraordinary powers, it will become Geralt's responsibility to protect them all.

  NEW YORK TIMES BESTSELLER • From the bestselling author of Before We Were Yours comes a dramatic historical novel of three young women searching for family amid the destruction of the post–Civil War South, and of a modern-day teacher who learns of their story and its vital connection to her students’ lives.“An absorbing historical . . . enthralling.”—Library JournalBestselling author Lisa Wingate brings to life startling stories from actual “Lost Friends” advertisements that appeared in Southern newspapers after the Civil War, as newly freed slaves desperately searched for loved ones who had been sold away.Louisiana, 1875: In the tumultuous era of Reconstruction, three young women set off as unwilling companions on a perilous quest: Hannie, a freed slave; Lavinia, the pampered heir to a now destitute plantation; and Juneau Jane, Lavinia’s Creole half sister. Each carries private wounds and powerful secrets as they head for Texas, following roads rife with vigilantes and soldiers still fighting a war lost a decade before. For Lavinia and Juneau Jane, the journey is one of stolen inheritance and financial desperation, but for Hannie, torn from her mother and siblings before slavery’s end, the pilgrimage west reignites an agonizing question: Could her long-lost family still be out there? Beyond the swamps lie the limitless frontiers of Texas and, improbably, hope.Louisiana, 1987: For first-year teacher Benedetta Silva, a subsidized job at a poor rural school seems like the ticket to canceling her hefty student debt—until she lands in a tiny, out-of-step Mississippi River town. Augustine, Louisiana, is suspicious of new ideas and new people, and Benny can scarcely comprehend the lives of her poverty-stricken students. But amid the gnarled live oaks and run-down plantation homes lie the century-old history of three young women, a long-ago journey, and a hidden book that could change everything.

This is the third in the Kate Marshall series following “Nine Elms” and “Shadow Sands”.  Anyone who missed reading the first two novels in the series should have no qualms about reading “Darkness Falls” as enough background information is included that it reads very well as a stand-alone novel. However, I think it enriches the reading experience if you read the series in order to get the complete backstory of the characters.I enjoyed Kate Marshall’s character and her relationships with her assistant, and her son. All were rich and believable. Kate has more baggage than most women in their forties and she is working hard to leave it behind her – including her longing for alcohol. A ‘day at a time’ battle that she is determined to overcome.The atmospheric locale added greatly to my enjoyment of the novel.The narrative is well-balanced between the ‘case’ and Kate’s home life. This time out the duo seek to achieve what the police have failed to do in twelve years. They want to find out what became of the journalist Joanna Duncan. Also, this story tells of their efforts to maintain the caravan park and dive shop that were part of Kate’s inheritance from Myra.“Darkness Falls” probes themes of duplicity and crimes against gay men.The ending was the perfect denouement to show how they solved the case and also as a lead-up to the next Kate Marshall title which is highly anticipated by me.Highly recommended to all lovers of intelligent crime fiction.\n\n', '\n\n  Robert Bryndza is back with another intense crime thriller with Kate Marshall at the helm. With a sordid past as a police detective, Kate has opened up her own investigative agency and is ready to take on the world. She’s given a cold case, where a journalist disappeared twelve years before. While there are some possible avenues to explore, the police have given up. All that being said, Kate and her partner begin finding a new and interesting connection with some other cold cases in the area, which could be the momentum they need to acquire answers.Kate Marshall had high hopes when she worked for the Metropolitan Police, but addiction and other skeletons in her closet kept her from being able to stay on the right path. She’s taken her skills and turned it into something great, opening a private investigative agency, supplementing her time as a lecturer at the local university. Working with her partner, Tristan Harper, Kate is hoping to make a name for herself and earn a decent living.When she’s given a cold case, Kate has high hopes that she and Tristan will be able to solve it. A journalist went missing twelve years before, one who was gritty and determined like few others. She’d brought down a sitting Member of Parliament for potential indiscretions, but he had a solid alibi for the time of the disappearance. Working through the police files given over by the family, Kate and Tristan come across some names that do not seem to fit.Deeper digging reveals that these were young men who went missing in the years before the journalist’s disappearance. They frequented gay bars and some had a connection of a commune in the area. The more Kate and Tristan push, the stronger the potential connection of the disappearances. Could someone have been trying to write a story, connecting the missing men to someone around the bars?All the while, a killer lurks just out of sight. Their target is one of the seedy bars on the outskirts of town. When a young man is found raped and murdered, Kate cannot help but wonder if there is a connection to the cold cases she has on her radar. Forensics makes some connections, but there is nothing to tie these disappearances to any particular killer. Still, things may be slowly coming together, but at what cost? Another great novel by Robert Bryndza that will keep readers flipping pages into the night.I always enjoy a great thriller and Robert Bryndza has never failed to deliver. His attention to detail is like no other and he finds intriguing ways to keep the reader engaged throughout. The stories are not outlandish, but neither are they plain and easily deduced. This is the second of Bryndza’s series that I have tried, which is equally as intense and has me wanting more.Kate Marshall has a major backstory that continues to reveal itself here. While series fans will know some of her past, Kate is still trying to come to terms with them, as things emerge to remind her of where she was all those years before. Bryndza allows for some wonderful character development here, both professional and personal, which offers Kate Marshall a new perspective as she is getting her life in order. I am eager to see where things will take her in the coming novels, as I am ready for more as soon as possible.Robert Bryndza is an amazing writer with strong capabilities. He writes well and keeps the story moving along. The narrative builds from the opening chapter and there is no time at which I felt things dragged. The story evolved well, using short chapters to tease the reader into pushing forward just a little more. Tackling social and societal issues amongst the murder investigation, Bryndza does not shy away from topics and keeps the reader educated throughout the experience. I can only hope for more, as he has a knack when it comes to crimes thrillers!Kudos, Mr. Bryndza, for another winner. Don’t keep us wondering for too long, as your fans surely love what you have to offer.\n\n', '\n\n  Darkness Falls is another gripping thriller in the Kate Marshall series.Kate and her partner Tristan are getting their detective agency up and running on a cold case that involves the disappearance of journalist Joanna Duncan.At the same time gay men are disappearing and being murdered.Did Joanna know something that the police did not?Robert Bryndza does a great job leaving clues and red herrings and once again he out smarted this reader.Thought I knew but I was wrong.I thoroughly enjoy anything written by Mr. Bryndza and the Kate Marshall series is no exception.

The main characters have depth and are relatable, and the author makes you care about what happens to them.I highly recommend this book to any and all lovers of mysteries.\n\n"", ""\n\n  Private detective Kate Marshall and her partner Tristan Harper are hired by Bev and her friend Bill to investigate the disappearance years before of Bev's daughter Joanna, a journalist.

  From the bestselling author of The Bomber Mafia, learn what sets high achievers apart—from Bill Gates to the Beatles—in this seminal work from ""a singular talent"" (New York Times Book Review). In this stunning book, Malcolm Gladwell takes us on an intellectual journey through the world of ""outliers""—the best and the brightest, the most famous and the most successful. He asks the question: what makes high-achievers different?His answer is that we pay too much attention to what successful people are like, and too little attention to where they are from: that is, their culture, their family, their generation, and the idiosyncratic experiences of their upbringing. Along the way he explains the secrets of software billionaires, what it takes to be a great soccer player, why Asians are good at math, and what made the Beatles the greatest rock band.Brilliant and entertaining, Outliers is a landmark work that will simultaneously delight and illuminate.

Maybe this is because I feel that I am in the sort of position these people once were with respect to my current career path but I think the main point is just to gain awareness of the obstacles some of us may have to overcome, whether its surrounding ourselves with better people or searching for opportunities in a field that is important to us. Some things we can change and some we can't, so we might as well work with what we can change and control.\n\n"", '\n\n  A masterful analysis of the critical factors which determine individual success in almost any field or endeavor. Gladwell as usual poses the conventional wisdom and then proceeds to tear it to shreds in example after example of how famous people have obtained success. He boils the potential for success down to two temporal factors: when a person is born in relation to major social or technological changes and how much time it takes to become very proficient at something. While native intelligence is important, it is not the critical factor in determining the potential for success. Over and over, Gladwell provides examples which show that luck, being at the right place at the right time and spending an inordinate amount of time perfecting a task are the determinants of success.\n\n']"

I got so easily lost in the story of two young men who have been best friends for years. Only getting to see each other during summer hockey camp. They are inseperable each summer until a bet changes the course of their friendship. For four years they have gone their seperaate ways until the hockey they both love brings them back together. Lines will be crossed, friendship will be tested once again. Can they come out on the other side of this still as friends or as something much more?I've already started Us & I don't want this story to end. I want to be friends with these two. I am living and breathing Wes & Jamie right now.These two authors are such a powerhouse when they combine forces. This book deserves all five stars & more!!!\n\n"", ""\n\n  I didn't really know anything about it. I saw Colleen Hoover posted on her page, that she read it and loved it... (Not that I don't have a brain and can't think for myself, but when she recommends something, you know its going to be good)I don't think I have read these authors, together or separate.1-clicked, and from Page 1 I was pulled in and captivated by this story! It was, at times, a gut-wrenching Journey and my eyes were tear-filled!! It is a shame that in this day and age, there are still some having to 'hide' who they really are. The author's description of some of these hurdles are realistic and pulllllll at your heart.I giggled through manyyyy parts of this story!!! The humour, quick-wit is 'laugh-out-loud, snort your a** off' funny!!! Their knowledge of hockey was impressive!An extra thrill, I am Canadian, love hockey, and live close to some of the locations they mention in the book!!! Extra giggles for me.The chemistry....smoking.hot.!!!If you are looking for a sexy, heart-felt love story, this is an excellent choice!!\n\n"", ""\n\n  I loved this book!  I wasn't expecting to.  I went in blind, curious to see what a partnership between two authors I enjoy separately would be like--and wow, they came together to produce a wonderful story!This is the story of Jamie and Wes.  The book starts in the present, four years after the last time they spoke to one another.  They used to be best friends who met every summer at a hockey summer camp, but Wes walks away from the friendship when he realizes he has feelings for his friend Jamie, who is straight.The book is about the two finding each other again, and rebuilding their friendship.  But it's also about them falling in love, and discovering what it means to be with one another.  It is a m/m romance, and that matters only because Jamie is discovering his sexual identity in this book.  But honestly, it is a romance novel, and I don't think it needs to have any gender or sexuality descriptor.I love the way Wes and Jamie are with one another.  At the heart of their love story is their friendship, and you can see how much they care about and support one another.  Add to that, the layers of sexual chemistry and attraction, and it's just a beautiful read.I definitely recommend this to anyone who is a fan of either Elle Kennedy or Sarina Bowen.  But more so, I recommend it to anyone who wants to see the friends-to-lovers trope done right.  It's the first in a duo, but this ends with an HEA.

Their chemistry could not be any stronger. My first foray into a same sex story and I have to say, it's almost hotter than traditional.

They weave a great story that is difficult to put down. Absolutely loved it.\n\n""]"

  A court reporter for the Nuremberg war crimes trial of Nazi doctors reveals the shocking truth of their torture and murder in this monumental memoir.Vivien Spitz reported on the Nuremberg trials for the U.S. War Department from 1946 to 1948. In Doctors from Hell, she vividly describes her experiences both in and out of the courtroom. A chilling story of human depravity and ultimate justice, this important memoir includes trial transcripts as well as photographs used as evidence.The author describes the experience of being in bombed-out, dangerous, post-war Nuremberg. She recounts dramatic courtroom testimony and the reactions of the defendants to the proceedings. Witnesses tell of experiments in which they were deprived of oxygen; frozen; injected with malaria, typhus, and jaundice; subjected to the amputation of healthy limbs; forced to drink seawater for weeks at a time; and other horrors.Doctors from Hell is a significant addition to the literature on World War II and the Holocaust, medical ethics, human rights, and the barbaric depths to which human beings can descend.“In this personal account of her service in the Nuremberg War Crimes Trials, Vivien Spitz continues to contribute to the cause of human rights.” —President James Carter  Read more  ","['5.0 out of 5 stars', '5.0 out of 5 stars', '2.0 out of 5 stars', '4.0 out of 5 stars', '5.0 out of 5 stars', '1.0 out of 5 stars', '4.0 out of 5 stars', '4.0 out of 5 stars']","['\nRecommended\n', '\nA distressing part of history.\n', '\nDoctors from Hell\n', '\nThis was a tough read and it had nothing to ...\n', '\nGreat read\n', '\nExaggerated\n', '\nFour Stars\n', '\nFour Stars\n']","[""\n\n  The book is very well written and vividly depicts the horrors of human experimentation during the Holocaust.

But I think the author actually wanted both those things, because they made the second half of the novel that much more enjoyable. It really turned my feelings about the book around. Without giving anything away I will just say, stick with it. The payoff, although not surprising, is completely worth it. And the title is brilliant. An entertaining read that makes you think twice about how you view other people's lives.\n\n"", '\n\n  I thought the psychological suspense in this novel to be relentless and addictive. It was difficult to put down and kept me reading most of the night. It is a story of diabolical scheming and dark secrets  it involves three main characters.  Amber is a devious young woman of suspicious and uncertain background. She is manipulative and insinuates herself into the lives of a very wealthy married couple. She envies their closeness,their home and possessions and plans to have their lifestyle for herself. The wife is Daphne, a beautiful and compassionate philanthropist. She lives in a lavish mansion with designer clothing and jewellery as gifts from her husband and seems to have unlimited funds to spend on herself. Daphne is the mother of two young girls. Her husband, Jackson, is an immensely wealthy and handsome real estate mogul. Amber schemes to have their wealth and life.  The first part of the book describes how Amber obtains Daphne’s sympathy, bonds with her over lies and quickly becomes her best friend and confidante. All the time she plans to take her husband and mansion by undermining her. With the help of Daphne she lands a job in Jackson’s office. Daphne seems naive and easily persuaded to fall for Amber’s schemes.  Then the book tells the story from Daphne’s perspective. We find she has some dark, miserable secrets of her own that she keeps from her friends and her estranged mother. Some frequent graphic sex scenes, mostly necessary for the plot, which prevented me from giving it 5 stars. The characterizations were very believable, but hope people like that are few and far between.\n\n', ""\n\n  The first third of this novel was ho hum. It wasn't bad enough to put down but it wasn't overly gripping either. Then after that it was unputdownable.  There wasn't a shocking ending or anything like that. I kind of figured what was going to happen after the ho hum part of the book was over. But, the characters were interesting and well fleshed out.  It kind of reminded me of the book Behind Closed Doors---though not nearly as fantastic.I This novel was entertaining and I would recommend it only if it's on sale.\n\n"", '\n\n  I enjoyed every second of this book and love how it is set up with the first half in Amber’s words and the second in Daphne’s.I didn’t need the epilogues, but, they did tie everything up in a nice neat bow.\n\n', '\n\n  I have just finished this book and loved it - so many unexpected twists and turns - never a dull moment - very well woven together to keep you gripped till the end.\n\n', ""\n\n  It is very descriptive of Amber's life at the beginning, and it becomes a fast read as the pages go by.

  Alvin and his wives had been busy over the last few weeks. They’d gone out of their way to visit settlements they’d helped in the past, all while killing a string of mini-bosses across what had been the American west. Life looked good for Team Asshole… until the devs made a mistake.Without any warning, Sammi stopped showing up. At first, they brushed it off as her being too busy, or maybe in trouble. That changed when a new dev showed up and tried to assert his dominance. That man was killed twice— first by Alvin blowing his head off his shoulders, then by Mousie running him through with both of her swords.With the gloves off, Team Asshole started breaking things they’d left alone. They circumvented rules left and right, cheated fast travel, and did everything else they could. A third dev appeared and pleaded for a chance to explain.Sammi hadn’t been fired, they were told. Instead, there was an unexpected development— Sammi was the first alpha tester. Now that they knew their friend was fine— and might even join them soon— Alvin and his wives backed off their shenanigans to give the new dev, Renato, a chance. It wasn’t long after that that they received a message from Sammi. She was in New Orleans, stuck in the Superdome with a Loa named Erzulie, and she needed their help. With no hesitation, they loaded up their helicopter, Sky Blade, and set off to rescue Sammi and those with her.After barely pulling off the rescue of Sammi and half a dozen other women, Team Asshole returned to their base. In the aftermath, Sammi joined Team Asshole fully, accepted as another wife by Alvin and with Gothy’s enthusiastic approval.

  Jack and I, we did everything backward. The day he lured me into his office-which was also the first day we met-he proposed. You'd think a guy who looked like him-a bit cold maybe, but still striking and very unattainable-would only ask the love of his life to marry him, right? You'd think he must be madly in love.Nope. It was me he asked. A complete stranger who had never even heard of him. A stranger who had been dumped by her fiancé only weeks before. You'd think I'd laugh in his face, call him insane-and a few other names-then walk away as quickly as possible. Well…I did all those things except the walking away part.It took him only minutes to talk me into a business deal…erm, I mean marriage, and only days for us to officially tie the knot. Happiest day of my life. Magical. Pop the champagne… Not. It was the worst day. Jack Hawthorne was nothing like what I'd imagined for myself.I blamed him for my lapse in judgment. I blamed his eyes, the ocean blue eyes that looked straight into mine unapologetically, and that frown on his face I had no idea I would become so fascinated with in time.It wasn't long after he said I was the biggest mistake of his life that things started to change. No, he still didn't talk much, but anyone can string a few words together. His actions spoke the loudest to me. And day after day my heart started to get a mind of its own.One second he was no one. The next he became everything.One second he was unattainable. The next he seemed to be completely mine.One second I thought we were in love. The next it was still nothing but a lie.After all, I was Rose and he was Jack. We were doomed from the very beginning with those names. Did you expect anything else?

I felt like I was experiencing Jack & Rose’s story with them because I felt how monumental and significant every moment was, big or small, in creating their soul-shattering tale..It’s a slow burn written in the best way possible, comprised of small yet remarkable moments, of words that seem so simple but mean everything, of the the slightest touches that are electrifying and goosebumps worthy. Rose was an absolute sweetheart! She was kind but bold, and the way she pushed Jack’s button’s and drove him insane made their chemistry that much more delicious.

  Set in a world of goblin wars, stag-sized battle ravens, and assassins who kill with deadly tattoos, Christopher Buehlman's The Blacktongue Thief begins a 'dazzling' (Robin Hobb) fantasy adventure unlike any other. Kinch Na Shannack owes the Takers Guild a small fortune for his education as a thief, which includes (but is not limited to) lock-picking, knife-fighting, wall-scaling, fall-breaking, lie-weaving, trap-making, plus a few small magics. His debt has driven him to lie in wait by the old forest road, planning to rob the next traveler that crosses his path.But today, Kinch Na Shannack has picked the wrong mark.Galva is a knight, a survivor of the brutal goblin wars, and handmaiden of the goddess of death. She is searching for her queen, missing since a distant northern city fell to giants.Unsuccessful in his robbery and lucky to escape with his life, Kinch now finds his fate entangled with Galva's. Common enemies and uncommon dangers force thief and knight on an epic journey where goblins hunger for human flesh, krakens hunt in dark waters, and honor is a luxury few can afford.“The Blacktongue Thief is fast and fun and filled with crazy magic.

  His grumpy neighbor needs some holiday sunshine…Gideon Holiday is the perfect neighbor. Need a cup of sugar? Spare folding chair? Extra batteries? He’s always ready to help. And he’s waited years for his hot, grumpy, silver fox neighbor, Paul, to need him. For anything. But this December, Gideon would  be happy if he  could just get the Scrooge-like Paul on board with the neighborhood holiday lights fundraiser.Paul Frost has no intention of decking his halls or blazing any Yule logs.  Even if his spunky bowtie-clad neighbor does look perfect for unwrapping, Paul would prefer to hide away until December is done. But when his beloved younger brother announces an unexpected visit, Paul needs all the trimmings for a festive homecoming—and fast.Luckily, Gideon is there with a color-coded plan to save Christmas. Soon Paul’s hanging lights, trimming trees, and rolling out cookies. And steaming up his new flannel sheets with Gideon. How did that happen?It’ll take some winter magic to preserve their happiness and keep these rival neighbors together longer than one holiday season.The Geek Who Saved Christmas is a low-angst m/m holiday romance with a guaranteed happy ending. This grumpy/sunshine, neighbors-to-lovers, found family tale features two heroes in their forties figuring out that maybe their sexily-ever-after was right next door the whole time. It stands alone and is not connected to any of the author’s other universes. However, it does contain a heaping helping of the same emotions and steamy moments readers have come to expect!

Fluffy, smutty with feelings, just angsty enough to add extra feels, Christmas happiness, and I loved both main characters.My ONLY problem with this book is the title. With Geek such a focus of the title I expected Gideon to be geekier. We get a vague impression throughout that he may be a geek. But it’s not a focus of the story. Since it’s part of the title I really expected his geekiness to be a big part of the story, but it’s not at all. He dresses a little dorky, wearing bowties even in casual situations, and has a tech job… but that’s really the extent until much later in the book when he has a brief conversation about fandom stuff that, again, plays no real part in the story.So… don’t expect this to be a geek-centric story, and you’ll LOVE IT.Seriously.

The story is low-angst, charming and completely captivating.  I was so sad when I finished reading it; I would have happily continued to read more about these delightful characters.

  ""What do you mean you have a fake fiancé?""Running into an old enemy can really do strange things to you. And when you find out said enemy is engaged to your father . . . well, let's just say the best of choices were not made. It was supposed to be a vacation of a lifetime before the school year started back up again. My best friend was getting married and I had a free trip to Hawaii. But that first night, I ran into not only my estranged dad, but his newly betrothed as well. Immediately my defenses were raised and before I knew it, I was telling them all about my beautifully handsome and extremely muscular fiancé who was on vacation with me. Which meant, I needed a man and quick. Unfortunately, Hawaii is a very small group of islands and my options of single men were limited. I was left with one choice, Brock ""Romeo"" Romero. He's handsome. He's muscular. And he's single. He checked all the boxes. So what's the problem? Unfortunately, we completely and utterly despise each other.  Note from author: This book is a smattering of tropes: Enemies to lovers, turned friends to lovers, and also coworkers to lovers. Not to mention, a fake fiancé romance that takes place in Maui and Chicago. Lots of heat--a balcony scene that will make you blush--absurdly funny pranks, best supporting cast, a surprise ""mom"" you'll never see coming, and a grumbly gus of a hero who can't stop pining after his girl.

The two of them have known and worked together for the last few years. Brock has had a crush on Stella for years and finally worked up the courage to ask her on a date. The only issue was that Stella had no idea it was a date and ended up going home with someone else at the end of the night. From that point on, Brock has been cold and distant towards Stella even though they used to be best friends. Fast forward to their friend and co-workers wedding at a resort in Hawaii. Once night, drunk Stella runs into her dad who she finds out is not only staying at the same resort but he’s engaged to her high school nemesis. Stella drunkenly confesses that she’s also engaged to Brock. The two of them engage in a fake fiancé charade for the duration of the wedding.This was hands down one of the funniest books that I’ve ever read. I know that this trope has been done over and over again but somehow Meghan knows how to put a new spin on things. The biggest issue with Stella and Brock is that they never knew when to communicate with one another. They just let things fester and they would both shut down. There are possibly too many good moments in this book to mention; however, the balcony scene and the way that Keiko describes it had me crying I was laughing so hard. There pool scene with Brock and Stella was one of the steamiest make out scenes I’ve ever read. This is a wonderful book that will have you laughing, crying and swooning.\n\n', '\n\n  The laughs are all there, just like in See Me After Class (read it first, it will make the reading experience here that much richer when you connect the dots). Stella and Romeo appear in that book and you will have such a deeper appreciation of where they start in this story if you read that one first. Plus, Greer & Arlo\'s wedding is the setting for most of this story, so go and find out how they got to this point.There is epic pranking that hits in just the right way (""man issue"" makes me snort giggle and I hope it keeps coming back), amazing drunken conversations with a kick-ass girl gang (I\'m just going to say ""Fireball"") and situations where you just have to ask yourself ""how did they get here?"" (hotel balcony sex anyone?).There is also so much heart you want to scream at the characters when they are being dense, cry with them in the lows and then cheer them on when they have the lightbulb moment before going out to make the grand gesture. And I have to say, as gestures go, this one hit me in all the feels.Sometimes I want to cuddle the characters in blankets and hide them from Meghan so she won\'t be bale to torture them any more, but then they wouldn\'t get the beautiful rainbow of a happy ending on the other end. So I will say, torture away my friend. Rip my heart out with theirs and then sew us back together better than we were before.We also get some seeds planted for the next book in the series. I can\'t wait to go to school again when the next one drops. This series is ripe for re-reads because it\'s just that damn good.The Audiobook was performed superbly by the epically talented Erin Mallon & Sebastian York. Erin Mallon\'s drunken girl talk is so well performed. She takes all the emotional levels and makes me feel them. SebYo is great as Romeo, from the not-so contained humour of his buddies when he\'s freaking out over his ""man issue"" to the gut wrenching broken hearted drunken Brock. His voice just slides down my spine and sweeps me away.\n\n', '\n\n  I was excited to read about Brock and Stella since they met in the previous book in this series. Brock has had feelings for Stella for years but has just masked it as being friendship. The one day he has courage to ask her out and she does not realize it is a date and ends up going home with that person.Things become tense between them but they are forced to have be together because of Greer and Arlo\'s wedding. A suprise guess brings Stella and Brock together making her ask him to be her fake ""fiance"" as they spend more time together will they find out if they are better together?This book had humor, heat, a swoony male lead yes I have claimed Brock he is mine! Meghan does it again and I cannot wait to read the next book she will release!\n\n', '\n\n  Romeo and Stella had great chemistry. I loved their easy and natural camaraderie when they were not awkwardly trying to avoid each other. My heart went out to Romeo. He knew exact what he wanted but the object of his affection was clueless to his feelings. It was frustrating to see his multiple failed attempts to make his moves.I loved the closeness and familiarity of the great group of friends. The pranks, teasing and antics were hilarious. I burst out laughing so hard at multiple occasions in the book. It was so much funny vacationing with them in Hawaii. Overall, I truly enjoyed this funny fake relationship, enemies-to-lovers rom-com and would highly recommend it to anyone who wants something funny, hot and heartfelt.\n\n']"

However, I don't always enjoy their joint books as much. I think this is because they have very different writing styles (I lean more towards Ella Frank, all her books are 5-star reads to me), so when they come together to write a book, it seems like their styles clash a bit.Ryder came across as a bargain-bin Logan (from Ella's Temptation series), and pushed that boundary between persistent and inappropriate (and not in a taboo way, but a bit of an annoying way) too many times. It was a bit too much back and forth, which I think was supposed to build up the tension, but it didn't quite work out that way for me. The characters were a little flat.That said, it intrigued me enough to read the entire book. This is NOT a badly written book at all, and both these authors are amazing in their own right. I've read almost all of their work and Ella is a 1-Click author for me.However, this will not deter me from reading their individual works, or their joint ventures, as they are both amazing. It was singularly this book that didn't work for me, and that's okay.Would still recommend ⭐⭐⭐The writing is still well done in it's own way, and I did want to see if they got their HEA, but did occasionally find myself skimming a bit.\n\n"", ""\n\n  𝘙𝘺𝘥𝘦𝘳 𝘸𝘢𝘴 𝘨𝘰𝘪𝘯𝘨 𝘵𝘰 𝘣𝘦 𝘯𝘰𝘵𝘩𝘪𝘯𝘨 𝘣𝘶𝘵 𝘵𝘳𝘰𝘶𝘣𝘭𝘦, 𝘣𝘶𝘵 𝘴𝘶𝘥𝘥𝘦𝘯𝘭𝘺 𝘵𝘳𝘰𝘶𝘣𝘭𝘦 𝘩𝘢𝘥 𝘯𝘦𝘷𝘦𝘳 𝘭𝘰𝘰𝘬𝘦𝘥 𝘴𝘰 𝘨𝘰𝘰𝘥.Book...

  It was indisputably love at first sight. But Victoria Lyndon was merely the teenaged daughter of a vicar. . .while Robert Kemble was the dashing young earl of Macclesfield. Surely what their meddlesome fathers insisted must have been true-that he was a reckless seducer determined to destroy her innocence. . . and she was a shameless fortune hunter. So it most certainly was for the best when their plans to elope went hopelessly awry. Even after a seven-year separation, Victoria-now a governess-still leaves Robert breathless.

Why? Because the h and H are wonderfully in love, seem well suited, so where can this plot go to fill out a whole novel? We know it won't be good, and from reading other reviews, I know the nature of what's ahead. The question is, do I want to suffer through that much anger, mistrust and suffering in order to reach the happy ending?I really like your writing, Julia Quinn, but you've lost me on this one....I'm out of here.\n\n"", ""\n\n  Victoria Lyndon, the seventeen-year-old daughter of the local vicar, is stunned to meet Robert Kemble, the young Earl of Macclesfield, and is even more stunned when he starts courting her. But when their fathers prevent them from eloping-and each thinks the other has betrayed him/her, they are both plunged into seven years of a bitter broken heart. Victoria runs away from home and goes to work for the amazingly cruel and insulting Lady Hollingwood, as a governess to her impossibly bratty son Neville. It's been seven years since she's seen Robert, but she's been unable to forget him. When he shows up at a weekend house part Lady Hollingwood throws, Victoria is speechless. Robert is furious: here she is in front of him-the woman who wanted him only for his money and title and whom he still burns for. He's spent seven years in other women's arms trying unsuccessfully to extricate Victoria from his heart. Now he vows to seduce and abandon her to get his revenge. But as Robert forces his attentions onto a hesitant yet attracted Victoria, he soon realizes that he can never let her go. He won't marry her but he'll bind her to him forever. When he asks her to be his mistress instead of his wife, Victoria's heart is broken a second time, and all she can think of is escaping from the man she will never be able to banish from her heart. This novel has a touching beginning-the courtship between Victoria and Robert is beautiful and refreshing. However, the subsequent rift between them is frankly implausible: there is no way the reader can believe that Robert would assume the worst when Victoria fails to show up for their elopement, even after he spies her asleep in her bed. He has no way to know her reasons, and to abandon her without finding them out reflects very badly on him. Even when the reader gets over this, Victoria then seems incredible when she is for awhile irritatingly prudish and churlish. Yet despite this and despite the failure to fully develop Victoria and Robert's characters, Everything and the Moon is often fun and touching. It is especially delightful when Robert kidnaps Victoria and takes her to a deserted cottage on the coast where they must somehow work out their differences. The dialogue and overall sensibility is not as humorous as Quinn's earlier trilogy, but this is still overall an entertaining novel.\n\n"", '\n\n  Let me preface this review by saying that I really like Julia Quinn. She is, in fact, one of my favorite romance authors ever. I discovered her with ""The Duke and I,"" I devour each of the Bridgerton books as they come out, and now I\'ve gone looking for her earlier books to tide me over until the next installment.Unfortunately, ""Everything and the Moon"" is not one of her best works. It\'s not *bad*, by any means, but there\'s nothing particualarly memorable about it either. The plot doesn\'t flow very well -- each segment seems a little disjointed from the one that came before -- and it could have borrowed from any of a thousand other romance novels. The characters don\'t really stand out either; they\'re fairly generic, as if they were sent from Central Casting and not fleshed out at all. I\'ve just finished the book, and I have a feeling that in a few days, I won\'t remember much about it at all.Despite this middle-of-the-road quality, it does have its good points; I occasionally saw flashes of Ms. Quinn\'s trademark wit and style. Robert\'s reaction when he almost walked in on Victoria in the bath amused me to no end, and the way Victoria trounces the villain at the end of the book made me both laugh and cheer. But, on the whole, this book was rather flat.This is one of Ms. Quinn\'s earlier efforts, and it shows -- she has greatly improved as writer since then, in my opinion. If you\'re just looking for a regency romance to read, there\'s nothing actually *wrong* with this book; there\'s just nothing really exciting about it. If you\'re looking for early Julia Quinn, I recommend reading ""To Catch an Heiress"" instead; it\'s much more lively and charming. If you\'ve never read anything by Julia Quinn before, I recommend picking up a copy of ""The Duke and I,"" the first volume of the Bridgerton series -- you\'ll be letting yourself in for a real treat!\n\n']"

I was so happy and excited when I got it in the wee hours of the morning of May 2nd but I got scared that it took me a day to muster my courage to finally read it (after waiting for a year, hello!). My review might have tiny bits of spoilers (but no major details), so do not proceed in reading this if you don\'t want to know any events in the book.So... Let\'s talk about the beginning, with where the second book ended. If you remember there was so much hatred there for Tamlin, and Feyre was determined to bring the whole Spring Court down. That was a major cliff-hanger as it was so intense and very promising. We waited for a year to find out how she\'s going to handle the situation there alone. However, it was just disappointing for me that I found that certain period to be really short and I wish the time she spent there was a bit longer - that there were more deceiving events. But of course, the story needed to move on at some point.I must say that Feyre\'s strength, maturity and loyalty were really evident in all the efforts she exerted to form certain alliances even with other characters that I really didn\'t see coming, (view spoiler) and all the adventures that she went into together with Rhysand and the rest of their family. I admire her that she was able to hold her own and prove to the others that she is worthy of being called a High Lady - it\'s just so majestic, especially when she claims and says it out loud!On another note, I found her and Rhysand annoying though at some point. It was whenever they kept on saying that everything is always Feyre\'s choice. I got that message already in ACOMAF, and another mention of it in this book wouldn\'t have hurt. But I didn\'t expect it to be repeated over and over here. Also, the intimate scenes between those two... they\'re a bit disappointing. They were lacking in so many ways and I don\'t know if it was because of the safe words used by the author, the lackluster description, or the fact that it had already been established by SJM in Q&As that Feyre and Rhysand will remain as mates - so it wasn\'t as interesting anymore as it used to be in the second book. It could be because in ACOMAF, there was that mystery, tension and longing between them. But now, they\'re just always cheesy and lovey-dovey. Those scenes could\'ve been upped to be sexy and steamy since this is actually NOT a children\'s book (let\'s not forget that this series is wrongly categorized since the beginning under children\'s/teens\' which is mortifying)!There were also other events in the book that just kept me asking for more. Most of the supposed-to-be important events had me on my toes and kept me reading for hours with no food and water. The suspense in each event were greatly amplified but sometimes they just leave me shaking my head because of the half baked story telling. It made me then think that they were just snippets forced to be included in the story to at least have something to look forward to or be fearful of. Don\'t get me wrong, they were indeed essential in the flow of the story but how SJM made the characters deal with the problems and the actions they took to solve them could\'ve been prolonged and more detailed.As for the other characters, I ADORE THEM! With Nesta, that much I have expected and never changed - she\'s still as feisty as she can be. And her with Cassian, it hasn\'t really been established but I\'m hoping you guys have already read the short story about those two right after ACOMAF was released last year. There\'s indeed tension and passion between them and I think it will just be a matter of time before the mating bond (I\'m hoping, I\'m really hoping that it exists!!!) snaps into place. With Lucien, there was a bit more of him here as compared to the second book. He showed how courageous he is (view spoiler) but I\'m craving for him more in action! And of course, Rhysand. He was such a great support to Feyre and he really showed how selfless he is in this book. Aside from doing his best to unite everyone, he really gave his all to protect everyone and to achieve that goal of creating a new world - another dream of his. As for the new characters (and old ones with their revelations)whom I will not mention so I don\'t really spoil anything, love the diversity! From the appearance, the secrets, up to their own personal selves - I am so happy that these were included in the story! Inclusion, that is the main theme of this story. Everyone is struggling with their own issues, and it\'s not bad to be different. You\'ll see in this book that some of the characters would just want to be themselves and be free of all the judgements from other people. They had to struggle to exist in their own right (be it Fae, human, or whatever creature), to hide the truth they had to hurt people around them, not to mention also their own selves. So it\'s not just about what kind of creature you are, but it\'s also about who you really are and how it is important to be able to be included and accepted in society openly - a world open to diversity and inclusion.And now let\'s talk about Tamlin. I still have a soft spot for him and I can understand why he became such a pain to everyone. Hey, he was fooled! Let\'s not forget, Feyre showed understanding, kindness and love not just to him but also to his people in the very beginning of this series. And because of that, he was able to love and become happy again after a long time. But she tricked him! So imagine everything he went through from the very start, all the guilt inside him building up as time went by, all his efforts trying to make up for the mistakes he made cast aside and he ended up in a pit again - but it\'s deeper this time. As I\'ve mentioned in my ACOMAF review, Tamlin was already broken to begin with, even before meeting Feyre. And it just became worse as he was fooled and played with by everyone around him! He had high hopes, he really did. Unfortunately, they all just broke him even more into tiny little pieces. He was left with no one to turn to. So I can just imagine the kind of darkness he was in. Love can be really cruel as it made him choose the wrong decisions left and right. Let\'s give him some credit because he did try to redeem himself by making up for everything he had done in the past to keep Feyre happy and safe. And I still admire him. He\'s a dreamer and I too hope he finds happiness. Oh, how I cried harder with what he did...So after all those surprises left and right - all the lies, betrayals, scandals, bargains, allegiance, loyalty, revelations, sacrifices, and promises, I think A Court of Wings and Ruin deserves 4 stars from me even though I was actually expecting a different ending (view spoiler). Even with all the ""girl power"" (how lame I might\'ve worded it to be), in the end Sarah J. Maas showed that in this war, it\'s not just the High Lords who have vital roles. There was also emphasis on those who are different, evidently those who were ""Made"" to push for harmony between humans, faes and other creatures. The message that it is indeed possible to build that kind of world, only if the majority is willing to fight for it.And that concludes my LONGEST book review ever! There were just so much to say that I have to mention some specific details in the book to make my point. And if you\'re curious, I also cried in this book because of certain events - especially at the end, like my feelings were toyed with by the author. My full review with spoilers can be found on my Goodreads account, but I\'m not sure if I\'m allowed to post the link here. So it\'s up to you to be able to find me there! ;)\n\n', ""\n\n  All I can say is that you should definitely read this book. I loved it so much! I could not put it down. Love, drama, bargains, magic, power and war makes it great reading. Thought the end was a little bit rushed but that's probably cos I didn't want it to end. Thanks for writing such a great book, Sarah! Tempted to reread them all straight away!!\n\n"", '\n\n  I love this series. It captured me immediately and every time I read it, I burn through the series so fast because I become so involved with the characters I simply cannot put it down.I want more of them and their stories, past book 4. I could read about their adventures forever. This is one of the few series that is always on my “must re-read list”.\n\n', ""\n\n  Yet again Sarah Maas lured me into her world and I didn't want to leave.  This third book in the Court series did not disappoint and in fact, each book in the series improves and impresses. There were so many things happening in this book to continue the story from book 2. The best part of this book was that I didn't want to finish this book and leave behind Rhys and company. I don't feel I can say much about the actual plot  without spoiling key points because there were several shocking and jaw dropping moments. I love the roles of Elaine and Nessa and how they became incorporated into Feyre's new world. Maas does an excellent job of mixing basic character development and big epic life changing stories all together.\n\n"", '\n\n  Feyre, newly made Lady of the Night Court and bonded to Rhysand, has pretended the return of her memory and returned to Spring with Tamlin and Lucien, preparing to meet with Ianthe and the Hybern royals to determine the method and place of attacking the human realm on the other side of The Wall.  After a battle with the royals Feyre and Lucien make a tortured escape to the Night Court in order to try to gather support among the Courts and other possible allies to face the upcoming battle for Prythian.  Hybern has decided to remove the wall between the Fae and humans and the Courts must decide to either support and protect the humans or join Hybern in the slaughter.  As the various Courts make their decisions Feyre and her sisters, Nesta and Elain, changed to Fae by the Cauldron, must use their powers to support the Courts protecting the humans leading to a war between the Courts either for or against the plans of Hybern.  This is an excellent continuation (apparently not a conclusion) to the sage of Feyre.\n\n', ""\n\n  This was a good book - but still does not compare to ACOMAF. I was left needing more ... from the various different characters story lines. I know she has other storys from this world coming up ... but I felt that ACOWAR just left me unsatisfied because of all the lose ends still not tied up. Also I thought the ending was a little ... repetitive. I mean don't get me wrong, I'm glad it ended how it did .. but it felt rushed.Overall it's still a must read.

  Revised and updated: the definitive primary-source history of US involvement in General Pinochet’s Chilean coup—“the evidence is overwhelming” (The New Yorker).    Published to commemorate the fortieth anniversary of General Augusto Pinochet’s infamous September 11, 1973, military coup in Chile, this updated edition of The Pinochet File reveals the shocking, formerly secret record of the US government’s complicity with atrocity in a foreign country. The book now completes the file on Pinochet’s story, detailing his multiple indictments between 2004 and his death on December 10, 2006, including the Riggs Bank scandal that revealed how the dictator had illegally squirreled away over $26 million in ill-begotten wealth in secret American bank accounts.   When it was first released in hardcover, The Pinochet File contributed to the international campaign to hold Pinochet accountable for murder, torture, and terrorism. A new afterword tells the extraordinary story of Henry Kissinger’s attempt to undercut the book’s reception—efforts that generated a major scandal that led to a high-level resignation at the Council on Foreign Relations, illustrating the continued ability of the book to speak truth to power.   “The Pinochet File should be considered the long awaited book of record on U.S. intervention in Chile . . .

  The mega-bestseller with more than 2 million readers, soon to be a major television seriesFrom the #1 New York Times-bestselling author of The Lincoln Highway and Rules of Civility, a beautifully transporting novel about a man who is ordered to spend the rest of his life inside a luxury hotel In 1922, Count Alexander Rostov is deemed an unrepentant aristocrat by a Bolshevik tribunal, and is sentenced to house arrest in the Metropol, a grand hotel across the street from the Kremlin. Rostov, an indomitable man of erudition and wit, has never worked a day in his life, and must now live in an attic room while some of the most tumultuous decades in Russian history are unfolding outside the hotel’s doors. Unexpectedly, his reduced circumstances provide him entry into a much larger world of emotional discovery. Brimming with humor, a glittering cast of characters, and one beautifully rendered scene after another, this singular novel casts a spell as it relates the count’s endeavor to gain a deeper understanding of what it means to be a man of purpose.

An aristocrat in Tsarist Russia who never worked a day in his life, he is a recipient of the Order of Saint Andrew, member of the Jockey Club, and Master of the Hunt. Rostov was out of country when the communists took over. Following his return to Moscow, he is made a ""Former Person” by a committee that the Count delightfully skewers in the process.This kangaroo court gives way to a Kafkaesque ruling. The Count can stay in The Metropol Hotel but if he ever leaves the building, he will be killed. Then the novel is off-to-the-races as we follow Rostov’s several decades long ‘incarceration’. He takes it all extremely well, “if a man does not master his circumstances then he is bound to be mastered by them.”I read each page with joyful expectation as to how the Count would react and what erudite turn-of-phrase he would spout. The book is as charming and stylish as Rostov himself. He is never condescending, nor does he present as superior. He is a gentleman and that distinction is clear given the brutishness of the country’s new leaders.Any mention of the plot here would rob readers of what you must discover yourselves. This is a fantastic read of old-world charm, Cold War shenanigans, a life well-lived, and varying wonderful notions of family and purpose.Instead of plot, let me share three snippets of wonderful prose:“Fate would not have the reputation it has, if it simply did what it seemed it would do.”“History is the business of identifying momentous events from the comfort of a high-back chair.”“Life is every bit as devious as Death. It too can wear a hooded coat. It too can slip into town, lurk in an alley, or wait in the back of a tavern.”\n\n', ""\n\n  How to confront oppression of the soul? With dignity, good grace and yes, civility. Count Rostov prevails, despite the restrictions imposed on him, condemned to live out his life in the confines of Moscow's Hotel Metropol.This charming, fanciful and lighthearted novel focuses on the best of human attributes. Sly comments justly level insightful and amusing barbs at the shortcomings of Stalin's regime and the ensuing soviet years.Although quite improbable it is an enjoyable read, just the sort of book that makes one smile before putting it aside and turning out the lights.\n\n"", '\n\n  An excellent read. Against a historical background in Russia, we follow the life, loves, trials and tribulations of Count Rostov who was banished to a tiny lodging under the roof of a large hotel.The story evolves logically and is interspersed  with philosophical musings. It is well written in a gentle style and keeps you reading on. No gore, but excellent descriptions of difficult events.\n\n', ""\n\n  Although A Gentleman in Moscow is well written and has at times a modicum of charm, I found it, on the whole,  pretentious and full of meaningless meanderings  I kept hoping that the plot would lead to somewhere but the book rambled on from chapter to chapter.  I was not able to establish a connection with the main character.  I couldn't have cared less if he lived or suicided himself.  I seldom leave a book unfinished but I didn't have the patience to complete this one.\n\n"", '\n\n  An amazing book!  Took my time reading it because I wanted to savour ever bit.  The characters were so well drawn that you could see them and hear them speak, the settings were very clearly described and were easily visualized, and the story line moved along smoothly.  It takes place in Russia, beginning a few years after the Bolshevik Revolution but is not the dark and gloomy Russia found in Dostoyevsky or Tolstoy.  The ending left me smiling broadly, yet with a small question on my mind.  Cannot recommend this book enough.\n\n', '\n\n  In spite of the enormous changes brought about by his incarceration at this hotel the Count was always as the title suggests, a GentlemanHe creates a special place for himself, and arranged his days as though nothing had changed. His routine gave him comfort I believe but his ability to adapt and enjoy meeting challenges was amusing and amazing  I loved the different characters that came and went or stayed.  Altogether very engrossing.  A satisfying read and different.  Russia at that time seems so odd.  Arbitrary decisions by communist bureaucrats that make no sense but could change a life in a heartbeat\n\n', ""\n\n  I had put off reading this book for some time. How interesting could a story about a man stuck in a hotel really be?The answer is - it's excellent. It is just a wonderful story that combines style, humour, historical references, love, suspense, and even some philosophy into a wonderful read that is never boring. Read it even if you think you might not like it. You will.\n\n"", ""\n\n  I’m not fond of Russia/Russians to begin with.  I've read a bit of Russian literatures, the classics, but not for a long time.  This was typical of what I remembered....wordy, long, borderline boring...but I kept with it, and it did improve.  I did scan lots of paragraphs, though...  I think it could have been préci-ed with no loss of momentum.  I won’t be buying/reading/recommending another by him any time soon.\n\n""]"

  Growing up, I knew my older brother’s best friend thought of me as “Logan’s kid sister.” For me, though, our next-door neighbor, Colin, felt like anything but a sibling.

But when we moved away and Colin’s band took off like a rocket, I knew my tweener fantasies would never become a reality.Fast-forward nine years to my brother’s wedding, when I saw Colin again and we shared a secret, drunken kiss that rocked my world.

I’m determined to make Colin swoon for me, the same way I’ve always done for him.

  2018 Next Generation Indie Book Awards, Finalist12th Annual National Indie Excellence Awards, FinalistOne June night, on a dark country road, two worlds—one of privilege and wealth, one modest and plain—collide, and tragedy forces two families together, causing both to question the lives they lead.Taylor Loden, future heiress to her father’s media empire, is fused 24/7 to her two cell phones, wakes up in the middle of the night to check emails, and has never examined her breakneck work pace or her empty life until she meets the Old Order Amish Yoder family of Lancaster, Pennsylvania.Taylor has zero desire to muck a barn or strip tobacco, yet feels compelled, for reasons she’s not prone to analyze, to temporarily trade her technology-fueled business life in Philadelphia for country life without electricity on the Yoder farm. While she strives to adapt to Amish life, she bonds with the family, especially with two of the Yoder siblings: Jacob and Becca.Jacob, the eldest son, refuses to baptize and join the church, and according to his frustrated father, lacks direction. He not only faces a grave physical challenge resulting from his actions that June night, but also harbors a secret that threatens to upend his family and community. Becca is 16, just entering her rumspringa, the time period when she is free to explore the normally forbidden modern world. When Taylor returns to her Philadelphia penthouse, Becca accompanies her for the summer and for the first time is exposed to city life—museums, music, technology, restaurants, fashion, even religious faiths different from her own.Taylor mentors Becca’s city fling and helps Jacob conceal his secret, actions that jeopardize her relationship with the Yoder family and her father. As the two cultures clash, both families struggle to determine whether the deep ties that bind them are greater than the differences that may tear them apart. Ultimately, Taylor, Jacob and Becca must answer for themselves:  Are we more than what we do for a living or where we’re born? And if so, what price, if any, is too steep to walk away from family expectations?To Everything A Season is a perfect book club selection—smart and sophisticated contemporary women's fiction that invites discussion as well as touches the heart.Awards for To Everything A Season:2018 Next Generation Indie Book Awards, Finalist, Multicultural Fiction category12th Annual National Indie Excellence Awards, Finalist, Multicultural Fiction category  Read more  ","['5.0 out of 5 stars', '4.0 out of 5 stars', '5.0 out of 5 stars', '5.0 out of 5 stars', '4.0 out of 5 stars', '5.0 out of 5 stars', '5.0 out of 5 stars', '5.0 out of 5 stars']","['\nHeartwarming and Insightful\n', '\nLovely read\n', '\nGreat book interesting read\n', '\nTo Everything a Season\n', '\nGreat\n', '\nAn enjoyable read.\n', '\nLoved this earthy heart warming book.\n', '\nA very good book.

  NEW YORK TIMES BESTSELLERThe highly anticipated new novel from one of our greatest living writers.It's December 23, 1971, and the Hildebrandt family is at a crossroads. The patriarch, Russ, the associate pastor of a suburban Chicago church, is poised to break free of a marriage he finds joyless--unless his brilliant and unstable wife, Marion, breaks free of it first. Their eldest child, Clem, is coming home from college afire with moral absolutism, having taken an action that will shatter his father. Clem's sister, Becky, long the social queen of her high-school class, has veered into the era's counterculture, while their younger brother Perry, fed up with selling pot to support his drug habit, has firmly resolved to be a better person. Each of the Hildebrandts seeks a freedom that each of the others threatens to complicate.Universally recognized as the leading novelist of his generation, Jonathan Franzen is often described as a teller of family stories. Only now, though, in Crossroads, has he given us a novel in which a family, in all the intricacy of its workings, is truly at the centre.By turns comic and harrowing, a tour-de-force of interwoven perspectives and sustained suspense, Crossroads is the first volume of a trilogy, A Key to All Mythologies, that will span three generations and trace the inner life of our culture through the present day. Complete in itself, set in a historical moment of moral crisis, and reaching back to the early twentieth century, Crossroads serves as a foundation for a sweeping investigation of human mythologies, as the Hildebrandt family navigates the political, intellectual and social crosscurrents of the past fifty years.Jonathan Franzen's gift for wedding depth and vividness of character with breadth of social vision has never been more dazzlingly evident than in Crossroads.

Her parents, Miko and Nessa and they showered their daughter in love and support and this is the reason she has high self esteem, is fierce and tenacious.

Whether you are there as an Heir, an Accountant, a Spy or an Enforcer these are all important roles that the students of Kingmaker begin to grow into as the school year progresses.  This is Leo Gallo's story but it also tightly weaves in Anna Wilk and Dean Yenin as well as introduces a variety of other characters.

Even though this heroine is younger than I am now, I was married and divorced in my mid-late 20s just like she is. I also was heartbroken over the end of my marriage, not over my ex husband (though, honestly, at the time I didn't know the difference between the two).This novel resonated with me in a lot of ways.

Madison is back in her small town, after her painful divorce, and the last person she expects to see, is the boy who broke her heart the first time. Porter sure has some sucking up to do, however their feelings for,one another never went away.

  One good scandal deserves another...Lady Alexandrina Lawson has never minded her widowhood. After the disaster that was her first marriage, she found it rather enjoyable, despite the pity she received. What the public saw as devoted mourning to a respected man was, in fact, a complete disinterest in participating in anything Society could offer her ever again. When an invitation to a cousin's London event proves disastrous for Alexandrina, her reputation, and that of her child, her choice becomes simple: rescue or ruin.Enter Taft Debenham, Earl of Harwood.Taft could not have less interest in Lady Lawson or her cold manner, but neither could he stand by and let her suffer a forced marriage to a drunken idiot. Sacrificing himself on the altar of Society, thinking how his own reputation might benefit, he provides a rather clever solution: marry the woman himself, and claim outrage for the offenses against her. Over the protests of his bride, and those of his own sanity, Taft begins the greatest scheme he could ever imagine. Nothing surprises him more than beginning to discover that his wife has a heart beneath her icy exterior.And that he would do almost anything to claim it.Mischief, Mayhem, and Marriage is a sweet Regency romance and can be read as a stand-alone or as the sequel to Rebecca Connolly’s previous novel, The Rivals of Rosennor Hall.

In an attempt to get him to say yes, she invites them to the track. That leads the way for them to spend more time together. While she knows she has never reacted to a man the way she does him, can she take a chance that he can be the one? As they become closer, things are starting to happen. Some might call them accidents but Falcon and his guys call them attempts to hurt or even kill her. Who is out to prevent her from racing? Is it the racer who seems to half love her and hate her? Is it one of the ones she calls a friend? Others get hurt when she’s the target. She doesn’t know what she should do. Stopping racing in the middle of the season doesn’t seem to be the answer. When the real culprit is revealed, she’s even more devastated than she ever imagined.

It was all very welcoming, all bloody hilarious and all very sweet. Oliver could probably have had some more page time - like, if I had to complain about one thing it would be that he was very private for a LI so him opening up more would have been great, but I do understand that it was a literal character flaw for him.

  IMAGINE YOU STOLE A MILLION DOLLARS –FROM YOUR FIANCÉ. ON THE EVE OF YOUR WEDDING.Dani Silver doesn’t have to imagine. She just did it. And she’s got big plans for her share of that million in cash she and her father scammed from her billionaire fiancé (although strictly speaking, that might make him her ex-fiancé.) Now she’s going to run her own operation—a long con, a dying art currently practiced by only a few old-timers. Fortunately, she learned from the best con man still living, as he’s happy to remind Dani…often—Leroy “Pops” Amadeus Logan, who happens to be her pops.Dani—or Mona Pasternelli, or Carly McNair, or any number of aliases she can pull out of her pocket—has gotten by for the past couple of decades on small cons. She’s got a con for every occasion. Need to get rid of your abusive husband? No murder necessary…it’s so much more satisfying to just mess with him and screw up his life.Thanks to her ex-fiancé, she can afford to put up the front money for the sting she’s got in mind, and she’s looking for a mark. But not just any mark. Her idea of going sort of  straight requires that the mark be crooked and really deserving of being fleeced.The perfect candidate appears in the person of a televangelist who talked the widowed mother of a friend into signing over her house to his church. When the plan runs riotously amok, Dani goes back to Pops for help in figuring out where she went wrong. She backtracks, adjusts course, and—with her delightfully cockamamie crew in tow—the game is on again!Author Lindsay has created a refreshingly human and appealing heroine who’ll keep readers coming back for more. Laugh-out-loud funny, inventive, and appropriately low-life, this delectable first taste of the Dani Silver series will delight fans of heist and caper movies (think THE STING, and all the OCEAN’S films, especially the all-female OCEAN’S EIGHT), TV series about loveable con artists and female criminals, like LEVERAGE, IMPOSTERS, and of course GOOD GIRLS—and books!There just aren’t enough of them.

And his life continues to go all topsy-turvy from there. The social awakening of this spoiled gentleman is at the heart of the story. It's breath-takingly beautiful, and moving and uplifting. Absolutely everything I love to see in a Christmas tale delivered with exquisite precision by a gifted storyteller.I loved all the historical details of Regency Christmas traditions. From decorating to partying to charitable works....I couldn't help but sigh over the naivete of a simpler time. We could all use this type of hearty Christmas cheer after this pandemic year!And there's romance!!!! Multiples, in fact, which sent me into a swoony tilt-a-whirl of giddiness. Oh...and Wally, the dapper terrier!!!! He's worth the read alone. :-)A charming, heartwarming, romantical celebration with the true meaning of Christmas at its very core.\n\n"", ""\n\n  An Ivy Hill Christmas by Julie Klassen is a delightful, warm-hearted novella that is sure to get you into the Christmas spirit.If you have read any of the author's Ivy Hill books, you will be delighted to return to that idyllic village and its cast of characters, once again. I confess, it is has been a while since I last read an Ivy Hill book, so I felt somewhat out of the loop, trying to recall the characters. Fortunately, the book stands on its own, and while you might have a little niggle that you are missing something, the story eventually unfolds enough that you are not at all lost.While this story has many interesting characters, the main focus is on Richard Brockwell and Arabella Awdry. Both have lessons to learn on judging others, making assumptions, trust and making new beginnings. I loved to see how these characters stretched and grew in their relationship with each other and with God.With a satisfying ending that you wish could go on a little longer, An Ivy Hill Christmas is a book you want to curl up in bed with, along with a hot drink of your choice! And as a bonus, there is a cookie recipe in the back of the book!\n\n"", '\n\n  What could be better than a farewell visit to our favorite little English village of Ivy Hill?  A visit  that takes place during the Christmas season, of course!  Julie Klassen has given her readers a wonderful holiday gift by sharing one last story about the characters we came to know and love in her three-book series “Tales From Ivy Hill”, plus we get to meet a few new faces as well.“An Ivy Hill Christmas” tells the story of ‘prodigal son’ Richard Brockwell as he joins his family at home for a long overdue Christmas visit.  Little does he know that this December may change his life - and the lives of several people he encounters - forever.A sweet and cozy novella that will help readers get in the Christmas spirit for sure, “An Ivy Hill Christmas” was a delight to read.  Not only was it a pleasant holiday story, but it was so nice to have one last visit with all of my favorite characters.  Although it could be read as a stand-alone book, you will have a much richer experience if you’ve previously been immersed in the Ivy Hill saga (“The Innkeeper of Ivy Hill”, “The Ladies of Ivy Cottage”, and “The Bride of Ivy Green”.)Thank you, Julie Klassen, for writing this memorable series - this Ivy Hill Novella was like the bow on top of a lovely Christmas gift.“Book has been provided courtesy of Baker Publishing Group and Graf-Martin Communications, Inc.”\n\n']"

It seems like every other book is written by a different author. One version of this author writes books with deeply thought out, complicated,  fascinating lead characters, and ""cannot put it down"" storylines. The other version of this author writes sloppy, immature, unbelievable trope that I would be better off using for bonfire kindling than wasting a few hours reading. Unfortunately, Mr Garcia falls into the latter category. Without giving away the story...even though I have a vivid imagination, I was unable to suspend my belief far enough to to buy that the future PM of England would act the way that Sebastian does whenever he gets into an argument with April (which is a lot). Nor can I believe that legal counsel to a man of such importance would behave the way she does. Is it supposed to be romantic when April brings up a concern to have Sebastian stomp out of the room, slam doors, and repeatedly tell her that he can\'t take any of her *@*!. That is literally repeated in every other scene these two are in. It\'s tiresome, immature, and only served to amp up my dislike for both characters. I could not have cared less if they ended up with one another at the end of the book, so I didn\'t bother finishing the last few chapters. I read that far because I couldn\'t believe how bad it was and kept hoping it would improve. It didn\'t. I was pretty disappointed overall in this effort from T L Swan because I know he/she can do better. I would rather he/she wrote less and focused on fleshing out her characters and storyline more, than churning out books just for the sake of it. This felt like a book that was put out on a deadline.\n\n', '\n\n  Mr. GarciaWritten by: T. L. SwanSometimes you can judge a book by its cover. This cover exudes heat, lots of heat and that’s exactly what you get. But the heat doesn’t always come from the steamy scenes between Sebastian Garcia and April Bennett. It comes from the story of two people, who in any other world but T. L. Swan’s might never have met.Their story happens over a period of time and I’m so glad that Swan did it this way. These characters needed time to grow and to move on before meeting again.Sebastian Garcia, well how does one describe a dominate, hot and steamy man who gives the real him to his friends and family, the business him to the rest of the world and the man who is in search of the right person to April Bennett.April Bennett, a woman whose heart has been broken, yet she picked herself up and moved to London, England. She’s late for work at the coffee shop but takes the time to watch a well-dressed gentleman stop and talk to a man begging for change. He leans in to talk to the man, and then give him 50 pounds she knew he wasn’t an ordinary person. He had compassion and when not long afterwards he shows up at the Coffee shop, she is intrigued. Tall, handsome, caring, she asked for his name to put on his coffee cup (and to find out who he was) that name Sebastian Garcia.The thread that continues to bring these two people together is unbreakable. The good the bad and the ugly is just that, but can these two work through it all?There will swearing at both characters, anger at one, sighs, the odd tear or two and so much more. Seb and April have an attraction that can only be described as fire meets dynamite followed by multiple explosions. Swan delivers wit and humor using Julian Masters and Spencer Jones (his best friends) who are always willing to razz Sebastian and share their friendly and often humorous opinions on just about anything especially if it’s at Sebastian’s expense.Thank you T. L Swan for bringing Sebastian Garcia and April Bennett to readers. They are smart, opinioned, sassy individuals who I loved from start to finish! Your books consistently give readers characters that make us shout, cry, laugh and adore.\n\n', '\n\n  TL Swan has another hit on her hands.  Mr Garcia does not disappoint in any way.  I loved the way the characters develop and how characters from her other books make an appearance.  It is so good, you want to read the end half way thru but you know that Tee will never disappoint her readers so you suck it up and continue reading even tho it is 5 am and you have to be up at 7.  Seb is hot and April is a feisty American who gets her law degree in Britain.  Seb and his friends Julian and Spencer still have breakfast and interact throughtout the book.  If you love Julian and Spencer you will love their content in Mr Garcia.  I gave this book 5 stars and would give it more if I could.  It leaves some questions, will Jeremy get a book, will Jeremy hook up with Adrian who does Willow end up with, so many roads to travel ..........\n\n', '\n\n  OH GOD!!!..This man was the next level!! This book was a rollercoaster of a ride! The book was worth the wait.....Sebastian was sexy as sin. This man had demons. He was damaged and guarded. But man was he so swoony. Dominant and bossy..April is a women that was wronged in life. She had her own obstacles in her life that she had to over come. She faced them head on. This  lady held nothing back. She was the perfect fit for the dominant and bossy man.These two were far from perfect but they went through everything together. So many emotions. He was it for her. She was there for the moments he needed it the most.This book had all the feels..the chemistry was off the charts HOT!!..The swoony moments...the angst. MR. GARCIA...was FILTHY.. ugh.. LOVED IT!!!This man has stolen my heart....All I can say is CASH or CREDIT baby.:P\n\n', ""\n\n  I am blown away by the depth of this story,. It's an outstanding story of strength, emotion, brokenness and love. Both Sebastian and April have been cheated on by their spouses. Both have been left broken, untrusting and looking for satisfaction in the wrong ways. This is a long story. It's full of angst, drama, chemistry and I had my stomach in a knot for most of the story, I was so invested in these two characters.We thankfully get to see Julian Masters and Spencer Jones and the banter and special brand of friendship that they have. Loved it\n\n""]"

  Ron Ketchum saw his share of the dark side of life as a cop in Los Angeles. Then he left L.A. to become the chief of police in the Sierra Nevada resort town of Goldstrike.  One sunny morning in the mountains, though, he comes upon a crime unlike anything he’s ever seen before.He finds the body of an African American man nailed to a tree.The victim is a highly respected minister, and his father is the nationally known televangelist Jimmy Thunder. Ron, on the other hand, has described himself in court as a recovering bigot.Goldstrike’s mayor for life and movie icon, Clay Steadman, wants Ron to catch the killer fast. Adding to the pressure, the victim’s grandmother comes to town. She tells the media mob that has descended on Goldstrike that God will curse the town until the killer is caught.That’s when a rogue mountain lion begins attacking people. At first, the attacks happen on the wilderness outskirts of Goldstrike. Then the predator moves into town, leaping a fence into a family’s backyard. Finally, it turns the tables on one of the hunters sent out to bring it down.Looking for a killer, hunting a lion and defending his own integrity — makes being a cop in L.A. seem like the good old days.

  Rob didn't think of himself as anyone special, but when a pitch-black portal tried to wrap his best friend in chains, he stepped up without thinking and found himself ensnared instead. His moment of heroism results in being torn away from everyone he knew and loved, kidnapped by an unknown force that leaves him with a note in his pocket stating: ""Good luck.""After being thrown into the wilderness of Elatra, a hostile fantasy world ruled by levels, stats, progression, and bizarre video game logic, he finds himself entirely out of his depth. Armed with nothing but a sword and the clothes on his back, he sets out on his the first day, and almost dies. On the second day, he almost dies again. On the third, he began to notice a worrying trend. And almost dies.It doesn't get any easier from there.Overcoming the wilds is just the first step in his journey; the society of Elatra is incredibly hostile to humans, having just come off of a devastating war that left over half the population dead, and getting the locals to kindle their faith and trust the last human in existence is a struggle in and of itself. Between being powerless in a world that hates him and suffering under a System that is altering his mind in unwanted ways, Rob quickly finds that monsters aren't nearly the biggest thing to worry about.As far as LitRPG Isekai adventures go, Rob drew the short straw in many ways. But that's okay - all the bullshit in the world won't keep him down. He'll carve out a place in this world with his bare hands if necessary. He'll survive, and then he'll thrive.Whether anyone wants him to or not.

Character writing is strong, the protagonist is genuinely likeable in a very human way, and the characters around him refuse to be just simple tropes and stereotypes, even in the antagonists. The worldbuilding is light and uncomplicated, but with significant enough meat in the history to strongly affect the story and give us context for the various antagonists positions.Weaknesses: Too much of the book\'s bulk is taken up by stats and character sheets fluff, but mercifully, specific parts of the book are marked off with notes by the author as to when it\'s safe to skip to the next chapter to resume the story, and I appreciate that a lot. -- The romantic interest could use more substance to her personality, but not nearly so badly as many other books in this genre.  -- The (presumed?) gods of the story feel wholly unnecessary, and I think the book would be stronger without them at all.Overall, though, I\'m praising through faint damnation here. The story plays very well to its strengths and mostly makes allowances for its weaknesses in ways that keep the reader engaged. Dialogue is good, character writing is strong, and the narrative voice is well aware that it\'s job is to keep the reader engaged and entertained.I\'m ready to put this one up on my bookshelf right alongside the ""Unsouled"" series by Will Wight. It\'s that good, and you simply won\'t find better than this in the LitRPG genre.\n\n', '\n\n  Easily my favorite new book this year, for a Potato they have a great sense of character dynamics and pacing.\n\n']"

Well worth checking out\n']","['\n\n  I have a few books by this author that I’ve been collecting simply based in her 5 star record but I hadn’t read any.  This is my first book and I was sorely disappointed.  This is a long book which normally is a good thing for me but 75% is all inner dialogue.  I need dialogue between characters to keep me interested.  I want to read a story that pulls you in as if you are part of it, not have it narrated to me. I can only read what someone is thinking for so long and at 700 pages it was beyond crazy. This book had several editing issues which should have been dealt with before it was up for purchase.  It is not enough to use auto correct as it obviously missed all the wrong word choices and missed words! This book had great potential, but the execution by the author was disappointing.  This story is about Nash and Emery.  They’ve known each other since childhood but come from opposite ends. Emery grew up in wealth and opulence, Nash is the son of one of their employees who’s always in trouble.  The meet several years later but now the tables have turned. Emery is miserable and Nash is a successful and powerful businessman.  Nash just wants revenge and looks for it through Emery.

It is completely different to anything else I have read; it was poignant, funny and truly lovely.  The parallel dialogue between Emery and Nash in person and on the app where they had no knowledge of the other’s identity was intriguing and a very clever tool of the author.  There were times I cried because it was sad and times I cried because it was so beautiful and the epilogue blew me away and the epilogue was stunning.  I can not recommend this book highly enough.\n\n', '\n\n  Parker S. Huntington gives us a slow-burn enemies to lovers romance. Nash is a broody hero that you can’t help but swoon over. Emery is quirky and you can’t help but love it. The chemistry between the two despite the age gap is perfection. A pair that couldn’t be more different found compatibility with each other. Two people broken and destroyed by lies and hurt find love and the journey to their hea was a ride that you don’t want to miss. It is mesmerizing and will have you fully invested from the opening pages.\n\n', '\n\n  A scrumptious read but man am I stuffed; pleasurably so!Loved the layout and esthetics of the book. I took almost a full page of notes BEFORE starting into the novel proper. *This is a mega long story, so, be sure to set aside a large length of time in order to devour this scrumptious read. Well written unique story that moves along easily. An excellent depiction of greed, intrigue, romance, sabatoge, loyalty, integrity, familial machinations, with the players clearly outlined. Characterizations were realistic and believable because Ms. Huntington allowed us to view a character, flaws and all. It is well worth taking the time to immerse yourself into the murky world that Ms. Huntington details so vividly. Such a thorough job was done, on every component of the story, that a reader walks away replete. Very much recommended reading!PSThis reader is so glad Ms. Huntingdon wrote this type of novel versus another mafia themed story, as I would not have had the pleasure of ""meeting her acquaintance"" via her ""Devious Lies"" novel. I hope to meet up with her in the not too distant future.PPSI also loved the fact that Ms. Huntington bundled all her story within one novel, versus breaking up the continuity of the story into four or five separate novels. Thank you for this.*Excerpt of the esthetics and the extra detailing Ms. Huntington brought to her novel:""Fate whispers to the warrior,\'You cannot withstand the storm,\'and the warrior whispers back,\'I am the storm.\'  -- UnknownTacenda / ta-\'chen-da- Things that are not to be spoken about or made public.- Things that are best left unsaid.Origin Latin participle, \'taceo\' - \'I am silent\'.Taceo also the verb for \'I am still or at rest\'.Taceo reminds us that silence isn\'t a sign of weakness.It is a sign of rest, of certainty, of contentment.Silence is the best response to people who don\'t deserve your words.""These sections were informative , interesting and remind me a bit about Linguistics.\n\n', '\n\n  Despite being an (mostly) unnecessary 700 pages long - this random book I got from Kindle Unlimited, was the surprising success of January.The book started a little shaky and overwrought for me. The first couple of chapters in Emery POV made me think this would be something I would give up on quickly. She was a little too precious and OTT for me in the beginning - she flipped through rage, silence, rebelliousness and drawn to Nash (our hero) in the space of three chapters. I was confused till about the end of Chapter 4.However, something happened after the whiplash went away. I got into the book and the relationship between Nash and Emery was quite fun. I liked the bite in their conversations and the relationship. It got a bit twee sometimes but I think that was because of the length.In the end, despite not being able to explain it, this worked for me. I even found theEmery’s habit of quoting obscure words, charming. I must give credit to the writer for this. I am going to check more out by her. Find of January 2020 for me!\n\n']"

  “A breath of fresh air . . . the vision is deeply imagined, very complete and controlled . . . Gibson is truly brilliant.”—Washington Times magazine From a true master of science fiction comes a collection of short stories that show how, no matter the length, Gibson is one of the greatest writers working today.Known for his seminal science fiction novel Neuromancer, and for the acclaimed books Pattern Recognition, The Peripheral, and Agency, William Gibson is actually best when writing short fiction. Tautly written and suspenseful, Burning Chrome collects 10 short stories, including some written with Bruce Sterling, John Shirley, and Michael Swanwick, and with a preface from Bruce Sterling, now available for the first time in trade paperback. These brilliant, high-resolution stories show Gibson’s characters and intensely realized worlds at their absolute best, from the chip-enhanced couriers of “Johnny Mnemonic” to the street-tech melancholy of “Burning Chrome.”  Read more  ","['4.0 out of 5 stars', '5.0 out of 5 stars', '5.0 out of 5 stars', '5.0 out of 5 stars', '5.0 out of 5 stars', '3.0 out of 5 stars', '4.0 out of 5 stars', '5.0 out of 5 stars']","['\nEdition counts\n', '\nexcellent\n', '\nFive Stars\n', '\nFive Stars\n', '\nFive Stars\n', '\nBook came slightly damaged, creases in the covers.\n', '\nClassic SF Short Stories\n', '\nToo short.\n']","['\n\n  Stories are great.

I personally loved Johnny Mnemonic and New Rose Hotel, which are pure Gibson.\n\n', '\n\n  Good book.\n\n', ""\n\n  As title, I'm sure the book is good, but it's not very good condition\n\n"", '\n\n  Burning Chrome is a collection of ten short stories by cyber-punk innovator William Gibson, three of which are collaborations with other authors. It\'s an eclectic ride as a whole. There is no overriding theme that ties all of the stories together - they range from cyberpunk to surreal. Gibson\'s prose can be very poetic and he does an excellent job of setting the mood in each story. Even when his characters aren\'t very likeable, you can still identify with their emotions.""Johnny Mnemonic"", ""New Rose Hotel"" and ""Burning Chrome"" are written in the same ""Sprawl"" setting as many of Gibson\'s novels. They are sharp and explosive cyberpunk stories that grab your attention and run. ""The Gernsback Continuum"" and ""The Belonging Kind"" are trips through what could be present day America with surreal twists. ""Red Star, Winter Orbit"", written with Bruce Sterling, is the poignant tale of an aging Russian cosmonaut on an equally aging space station. ""Hinterlands"" is an eerie view of how far humans will go to satisfy the need for progress and exploration. ""Fragments of a Hologram Rose"", ""The Winter Market"" and ""Dogfight"" are powerful studies of emotion, need, and what it means to be human.Overall, I enjoyed Burning Chrome. Gibson\'s writing style is fun to read - he can establish mood and atmosphere in a few short sentences. I also like that he uses technology as a means not an end - the focus in the stories is how people interact with each other and technology intstead of showcasing what a cool idea a particular future technology would be. His stories tend to deal with the grittier side of human nature, and are not always comfortable to read, but they make you think.\n\n', '\n\n  All of the stories in this brief collection were astounding.  Never very involved with hard science, opting more for dark, intense noir shaded by futuristic technology, Gibson creates a variety of worlds that amaze you with their detail and imagery.  He is one of the few writers who approaches science-fiction this way, giving his reader a view of society from the ground up.  He doesn\'t try that often to explain why things have happened, or why the world is a certain way; instead he drops you into his stories and forces you to come to terms with his reality.The Sprawl series, prefacing his first three novels (Neuromancer, Count Zero, Mona Lisa Overdrive) are the clearest standouts in this collection, even though I thought ""Johnny Mnemonic"" tried to do too much in too little space.  ""New Rose Hotel"" and ""Burning Chrome"" are absolute classics of cyberpunk, moreso than most books that find their way into the genre.""The Gernsback Continuum"" is uncommonly lighthearted for Gibson, and whether or not you believe Bruce Sterling\'s comments in the introduction, it\'s a great story. It\'s barely science fiction, but since the ""cyberpunk"" label was invented after Gibson\'s debut, this isn\'t surprising.Gibson\'s collaboration with John Shirley, ""The Belonging Kind"", is also incredible. It\'s interesting to try to figure out each writer\'s influence. Like the previous story, it\'s more surreal than scientific.""Fragments of a Hologram Rose"" and ""The Winter Market"" are fantastic stories that combine complex plots, characters, and romance with vivid near-future settings. These are some of the most powerful statements of the effects of technology on humanity in any field of literature.All of these are intense stories; the only real problem is there aren\'t more of them. It saddens me that Gibson slowed down his writing after ""Neuromancer"" - the sequels never measured up to the original, and his later books were like diluted versions of his earlier work.\n\n']"

  WINNER OF THE 2021 BOOKER PRIZEA NEW YORK TIMES EDITORS’ CHOICEA modern family saga written in gorgeous prose by three-time Booker Prize-shortlisted author Damon Galgut.Haunted by an unmet promise, the Swart family loses touch after the death of their matriarch. Adrift, the lives of the three siblings move separately through the uncharted waters of South Africa; Anton, the golden boy who bitterly resents his life’s unfulfilled potential; Astrid, whose beauty is her power; and the youngest, Amor, whose life is shaped by a nebulous feeling of guilt.Reunited by four funerals over three decades, the dwindling family reflects the atmosphere of its country—one of resentment, renewal, and, ultimately, hope. The Promise is an epic drama that unfurls against the unrelenting march of national history, sure to please current fans and attract many new ones.“Simply: you must read it.”—Claire Messud, Harper’s Magazine  Read more  ","['4.0 out of 5 stars', '5.0 out of 5 stars', '5.0 out of 5 stars', '4.0 out of 5 stars', '5.0 out of 5 stars', '1.0 out of 5 stars']","['\nA Tragic Tale of decline but with a glimmer of hope in integrity\n', '\nanonymous review:\n', '\nWonderful Book\n', '\nTends to rable\n', '\nAn excellent book\n', '\nNot my favourite read.\n']","['\n\n  This story is the rather morbid portrayal of an Afrikaner family struggling and failing to come to terms with the new dispensation in South Africa. A Mother dies. Having converted to the jewish faith, she is not allowed to be buried with her family which leads to contention. Also her promise to their black servant, that she will receive land and a house, casts a shadow of guilt, division and obligation on the family. The father flees into a distorted form of his religion, guided by shady spiritual mentors (Shady spiritual mentors seems to be a theme throughout. It is sometimes overdone, giving the impression that the writer has huge issues with religion and religious leaders and wants to settle a score). Three children inherit the family farm. Anton, the soul scarred embittered son who dreams big but follows through on nothing. Astrid the self centered daughter who turns into an immoral hedonist. Amor, the youngest neglected one who breaks out and build our own life as a nurse in Durban far away from the family drama. Astrid gets killed in a car high jacking and Anton commits suicide. Amor returns to the family farm as a middle aged woman and finds her peace in promise keeping and letting go.The story seems to suggest that care and sharing are the only real option for a life of meaning amidst the pain and decline in South Africa.\n\n', '\n\n  This is a beautifully written South African story covering decades of South African history and politics and the fictional story of an Afrikaans farm family.

  I took home more in a year than the CEOs of McDonalds, IKEA, Ford, Motorola, and Yahoo….combined….as a kid in my twenties….using the $100M Offer method. It works. And it will work for you. Not that long ago though, my business had gotten so bad that I literally couldn’t even give my services away for free. At the end of each month, I would look at my bank account hoping to see progress (but there wasn’t). I knew something had to change...but what? Over the next 48 months, I went from losing money to making $36 for every $1 spent. In that time period, we generated over $120,000,000 across four different industries: service, ecommerce, software, and brick & mortar. But, unlike everyone else, we didn’t have great funnels, great ads, or a wealthy niche. In fact, we didn’t even send emails until we had crossed $50M in sales(!). Instead, we were able to do this one thing really well….we created offers so good, people felt stupid saying no. Here’s exactly what this book will show you how to do: How To Charge A Lot More Than You Currently Are… a. The Tiny Market Big Money Process we use to laser focus on niche markets overflowing with cash b. The “Unfair” Pricing formula….how we 100x’d our pricing (and got more people to say yes….for real) c. The Value Flip...so you never get price compared again (that’s a promise) d. The Virtuous Cycle of Price...use it to outspend your competition (for good) while using your product to attract the best talent 2. How To Make Your Product So Good, Prospects Find A Way To Pay For It e. The Unbeatable Value Equation….to make what you sell worth more than your prospects have ever received f. The Delivery Cube….to make delivering your products and services cost less but provide more g. The Trim & Stack Hack….to maximize profit using the absolute best delivery methods. (This has never been shared publicly and was how we made $17M in profit on $28M in revenue in a year when I was 28 years old) 3. How To Enhance Your Offer So Much, Prospects Buy Without Hesitating h. The Scarcity Stack….how to use the three different types of scarcity in every offer you make (without lying) to get people to buy the moment you ask i. The “Everyday” Urgency Blueprint... to get prospects to buy RIGHT NOW, using everyday life to create real, ethical time pressure j. Unbeatable Bonuses...and watch your prospects' hesitations melt away as they begin reading their credit cards to you before you even finish! k. God-mode Guarantees...so good they make anyone say yes (even people who would never normally consider buying). I’ll show you how to stack and layer all 4 types of guarantees together. I even give you my 13 favorite guarantees word-for-word to swipe for yourself. l. Magic Naming Formula to get the absolute highest response rates and conversion rates from everything you do to get new clients And so much more… The methods contained within this book are so simple, so instantaneous, and so effective, it’s as if they work by magic. If you implement even one tactic in this book, you’ll see the change in your prospects' demeanor. And you’ll know the $100M Offer method worked when you start hearing “What do I need to do to move forward?” ...before you even ask for the sale. If you want to get more prospects to reply to your ads for less advertising dollars, and get them to say YES to breathtaking prices...then grab this book, use its contents, and see for yourself.

  A grand, devastating portrait of three generations of the Sackler family, famed for their philanthropy, whose fortune was built by Valium and whose reputation was destroyed by OxyContin, by the prize-winning, bestselling author of Say Nothing The Sackler name adorns the walls of many storied institutions—Harvard, the Metropolitan Museum of Art, Oxford, the Louvre. They are one of the richest families in the world, known for their lavish donations to the arts and the sciences. The source of the family fortune was vague, however, until it emerged that the Sacklers were responsible for making and marketing a blockbuster painkiller that was the catalyst for the opioid crisis.Empire of Pain begins with the story of three doctor brothers, Raymond, Mortimer and the incalculably energetic Arthur, who weathered the poverty of the Great Depression and appalling anti-Semitism. Working at a barbaric mental institution, Arthur saw a better way and conducted groundbreaking research into drug treatments. He also had a genius for marketing, especially for pharmaceuticals, and bought a small ad firm.Arthur devised the marketing for Valium, and built the first great Sackler fortune. He purchased a drug manufacturer, Purdue Frederick, which would be run by Raymond and Mortimer. The brothers began collecting art, and wives, and grand residences in exotic locales. Their children and grandchildren grew up in luxury.Forty years later, Raymond’s son Richard ran the family-owned Purdue. The template Arthur Sackler created to sell Valium—co-opting doctors, influencing the FDA, downplaying the drug’s addictiveness—was employed to launch a far more potent product: OxyContin. The drug went on to generate some thirty-five billion dollars in revenue, and to launch a public health crisis in which hundreds of thousands would die.This is the saga of three generations of a single family and the mark they would leave on the world, a tale that moves from the bustling streets of early twentieth-century Brooklyn to the seaside palaces of Greenwich, Connecticut, and Cap d’Antibes to the corridors of power in Washington, D.C.  Empire of Pain chronicles the multiple investigations of the Sacklers and their company, and the scorched-earth legal tactics that the family has used to evade accountability. The history of the Sackler dynasty is rife with drama—baroque personal lives; bitter disputes over estates; fistfights in boardrooms; glittering art collections; Machiavellian courtroom maneuvers; and the calculated use of money to burnish reputations and crush the less powerful.Empire of Pain is a masterpiece of narrative reporting and writing, exhaustively documented and ferociously compelling. It is a portrait of the excesses of America’s second Gilded Age, a study of impunity among the super elite and a relentless investigation of the naked greed and indifference to human suffering that built one of the world’s great fortunes.

Great read.\n']","[""\n\n  Review of Empire of Pain by Patrick Radden KeefeMost people are aware of the devastation and human suffering caused by the opioid addiction crisis that has been raging uncontrollably since the last decades of the 20th century.  At first, controlled substances such as morphine and heroin were not readily available to the general public. To have access to them, you needed contacts in the underworld of drug pushers, a place where ordinary people were not generally keen to venture into. A fix would most often require sticking a needle into one's veins, something that many people were afraid to try.  That, to a large extent, kept the lid on the widespread proliferation of the lethal drugs.  But in recent years, things got a lot easier for the addicts and the vulnerable.  The drugs became available in pill form and legally dispensed by doctors and pharmacies as medication to control pain.  One of those drugs that became well known, mostly because it ended up contributing to the crisis more than any other, was the FDA approved pain medication OxyContin.This book is the story of how OxyContin (and its predecessor Oxycodone) were invented and promoted, first as a legitimate drug to control chronic pain that soon hooked unsuspecting users into solid dependency from which it was nearly impossible to move away from.  But that outcome, that ended up costing he lives of over half a million Americans and countless others around the world, was the result of unethical – i.e. criminal – actions of one company, Connecticut-based Purdue Pharma, and one family, the Sacklers that owned it and controlled every aspect of its operations.  The purpose was to generate as much wealth for themselves as possible and more; and they did, billions of dollars.I decided to buy this book after listening to an interview with the author broadcast on a CBC morning radio show in early May 2021. I'm always on the lookout for history books – I never read fiction – and this sounded interesting even though (or because) I knew next to nothing about the drug industry.  In fact, until I read the book, I was under the impression that OxyContin was manufactured in some remote place somewhere in China and shipped to North America just to cause trouble!The book is well written, easy to read, a bit long – could be about 30% shorter – even though time was not an issue since I read it during a period of COVID-19 confinement.  One thing that I shall remember about this story is the fact that Isaac Sackler, the patriarch of the family, told his sons when they were young that it was more important to preserve their Good Name than whatever wealth and material goods they had acquired over the years (or something to that effect). They can always rebuild their wealth, he told them, but if they lose their good name, they will never get it back.  It turns out in the end that the family members held on to much of their wealth – despite paying billions in fines – but they lost their Good Name big time!\n\n"", '\n\n  I had previously read Keefe\'s book ""Say Nothing"" which educated me on the Irish \'Troubles\'. Empire of Pain was another triumph for Keefe.  Compelling journalism that is hard to put down and captures the details of the behind-the-scenes tactics of Big Pharma and particularly Purdue Pharma and the Sackler family in driving the opioid crisis.In the era of crashing 737 Max Boeing jets and devastating Oxycontin, one is left wondering about the corruption of the regulatory environment and the businesses happy to exploit for profit.\n\n', '\n\n  Well researched and written. It\'s the story of the Sackler family, the development and promotion of OxyContin by their company Purdue. EMPIRE OF PAIN  tells the tail of how a higly addictive narcotic was ""legally"" released into society and the fallout. The irony of the profits being donated by the millions so the Sackler name remained on into perpetuity is not loss.  It\'s disturbing how power and money can ""legally"" cause such havoc and destruction in our society.I had to read the book in ""chunks"" to properly digest the horror. As many, I had a close relative, a well-educated retired nurse, becone a victim of the over prescribing doctors in Florida.  War on drugs takes on a whole new meaning. A hard lesson but a MUST read!!\n\n', ""\n\n  If you are like me and had only read snippets about the Oxy scandal but wanted to learn more, then this is the book to read. Well researched and excellently written, this one spares no member of the family and reveals the depth of The Sackler's tone deaf greed and corruption. They made millions off of this drug with no regard for the pain and suffering that it caused. They simply doubled down whenever they were threatened and lawyered up. An appalling family that deserved to fall from grace in a spectacular fashion. An excellent read!\n\n"", '\n\n  Patrick Radden Keefe lays out a sobering account of the Sackler family’s decade long campaign of predatory marketing and deliberate obfuscations. This is a gripping delivery of the OxyContin story.I had previously understood the opioid epidemic as the tragic result of social circumstance and human despair. But this book lays out the Sacklers’ responsibility in this public health crisis.\n\n', '\n\n  Until recently, the fabulously wealthy Sackler family was known for its philanthropic largesse.. No one knew much about where their  fortune came from.  And  no one really cared - until the OxyContin crisis helped to launch the devastating opioid epidemic. . This is the story of the fortune that Oxycontin  created, and of the family that it enriched.  It’s also a fascinating account of  the development  of the modern drug marketing industry,  in which the Sacklers  played a crucial role.  Highly readable; full of descriptive detail and insight.\n\n', ""\n\n  Excellent book....Great detail of the Opioid Epidemic and it's originators....well written...and well researched...\n\n"", '\n\n  Very interesting read about money, greed, ambition, and the lengths some will go to for success. A family dynasty built on the pain of others. I said ‘wow’ silently to myself a few times.\n\n']"

  Based on the true story of a brave German nurse tasked with caring for Auschwitz’s youngest prisoners, Auschwitz Lullaby brings to life the story of Helene Hannemann—a woman who sacrificed everything for family and fought furiously for the children she hoped to save.  On an otherwise ordinary morning in 1943, Helene Hannemann is preparing her five children for the day when the German police arrive at her home. Helene’s worst fears come true when the police, under strict orders from the SS, demand that her children and husband, all of Romani heritage, be taken into custody. Though Helene is German and safe from the forces invading her home, she refuses to leave her family—sealing her fate in a way she never could have imagined. After a terrifying trek across the continent, Helene and her family arrive at Auschwitz and are thrown into the chaos of the camp. Her husband, Johann, is separated from them, but Helene remains fiercely protective of her children and those around her. When the powers-that-be discover that Helene is not only a German but also a trained nurse, she is forced into service at the camp hospital, which is overseen by the notorious Dr. Mengele himself. Helene is under no illusions in terms of Dr. Mengele’s intentions, but she agrees to cooperate when he asks her to organize a day care and school for the Romani children in the camp. Though physically and emotionally brutalized by the conditions at Auschwitz, Helene musters the strength to protect the children in her care at any cost. Through sheer force of will, Helene provides a haven for the children of Auschwitz—an act of kindness and selflessness so great that it illuminates the darkest night of human history.  Based on a true story, Mario Escobar’s Auschwitz Lullaby demonstrates the power of sacrifice and the strength of human dignity—even when all hope seems lost.  Praise for Auschwitz Lullaby:""Auschwitz Lullaby grabbed my heart and drew me in. A great choice for readers of historical fiction.""—Irma Joubert, author of The Girl from the TrainAn international bestsellerFull-length World War II historical novelA finalist for 2019’s Empik Award for LiteratureIncludes discussion questions for book clubs, research notes from the author, and a historical timeline  Read more  ","['5.0 out of 5 stars', '5.0 out of 5 stars', '5.0 out of 5 stars', '5.0 out of 5 stars', '5.0 out of 5 stars', '5.0 out of 5 stars', '4.0 out of 5 stars', '5.0 out of 5 stars']","['\nMezmerizong\n', '\nAmazing\n', '\nHard read but well written\n', '\nRemember the holocaust!\n', '\nBook\n', '\nGreat novel\n', '\nGreat book\n', '\nYou need to had this to your personal library\n']","['\n\n  I have studied the holocaust through I of Jerusalem and Had Vashem and read many books about it but this book was spell binding.

  This in-depth commentary on the lost material of The Gospel of Mary Magdalene presents Jesus’ most important—and misunderstood—disciple as you’ve never seen her before   Discovered in fragments in Egypt in 1945, The Gospel of Mary remains one of the most controversial texts of early Christianity. This translation of Mary’s teachings, from the original Greek and Coptic, offers a unique new perspective: authors Claire Nahmad and Margaret Bailey utilized “inner listening” to uncover lost material, and they present Mary’s ideas in the form of a dialogue between the (risen) Savior and His disciples.    Most importantly, The Secret Teachings of Mary Magdalene includes a description by Mary of special revelations given to her by Jesus. Nahmad and Bailey argues that Mary was not just the consort of Christ but the feminine Christ herself, and in their view, the partnership between Jesus and Mary exemplifies the crucial balance of male and female in spiritual and corporeal life. It’s an interpretation that uncovers a rich subtext in Mary's words, offering wisdom on an extraordinary range of concerns—from the origins of the human race to the pathway to Christlike consciousness.

  Academy Award–winning actress, producer, and entrepreneur Reese Witherspoon invites you into her world, where she infuses the southern style, parties, and traditions she loves with contemporary flair and charm.Reese Witherspoon’s grandmother Dorothea always said that a combination of beauty and strength made southern women “whiskey in a teacup.” We may be delicate and ornamental on the outside, she said, but inside we’re strong and fiery. Reese’s southern heritage informs her whole life, and she loves sharing the joys of southern living with practically everyone she meets. She takes the South wherever she goes with bluegrass, big holiday parties, and plenty of Dorothea’s fried chicken. It’s reflected in how she entertains, decorates her home, and makes holidays special for her kids—not to mention how she talks, dances, and does her hair (in these pages, you will learn Reese’s fail-proof, only slightly insane hot-roller technique). Reese loves sharing Dorothea’s most delicious recipes as well as her favorite southern traditions, from midnight barn parties to backyard bridal showers, magical Christmas mornings to rollicking honky-tonks. It’s easy to bring a little bit of Reese’s world into your home, no matter where you live. After all, there’s a southern side to every place in the world, right?

From start to finish I was mesmerised with the plot and the strong forceful characters. This story was like stepping into a bond film; from the very first page until the very last the excitement, the tension, all the twists and turns made for a phenomenal read.Liam Black is a presence to be very aware of. Head of the Irish Mafia, by all means, he is a dangerous man to be around. Alpha male personified, possessive, gorgeous, brooding and sex on legs, woman fall at his feet and men quiver in his presence. He always gets what he wants but he might have to work a little harder when he sees Truvy. He makes no bones about wanting her, only she might have other ideas.Truvy's character was so enjoyable to read, at first she came across as a little shy and quiet but when the going got tough, Truvy got going. What a little firecracker Truvy turned out to be, but will the Irish charm of Liam be enough to win her around, or when she finds out just who and what he does for a living make her run for the hills. Truvy might not have any choice in the matter.I can only describe this book as totally addictive, I couldn't put it down. It basically had it all. Wonderful characters; Liam was to die for, I literally drooled all the way through this book. The plot was sensational and kept me on the edge of my seat, the sex was hot and erotic yet beautifully written, in fact, the whole of the book was perfection. What more can I say but this book is an absolute MUST read, well done J.T. Geissinger, a new author for me but I will be looking up more of her books to read in the future.\n\n"", ""\n\n  WOW! This story was everything! It’s witty, intense, funny and very sexy. The chemistry between Tru and Liam is so intense and hot that it oozes off the pages and lit my kindle on fire! These two had me laughing out loud and falling head over heels in love with them.Tru made me laugh so hard I was snorting. She’s sexy, smart, very funny and utterly fierce. This girl was raised by a fierce independent woman and she doesn’t let anything get in her way!“l don’t know what kind of woman you’re used to, but my mother didn’t raise a worker bee. She raised a queen... And I don’t give away the honey for free.”Liam is the ultimate sexy alpha male. He’s mysterious, broody and intense. Liam can set anyone’s panties on fire just with his smoulder! Just reading about him made me a gooey puddle! Together Liam and Tru have an undeniably intense connection. Their sexual chemistry is sizzling hot and highly combustible!This story will captivate and entertain you from the very beginning and keep you completely enthralled until the very end. It's exciting and suspenseful and will keep you on the edge of your seat with all of the surprises and little twists and turns throughout. The ending will literally blow your mind!Phenomenal! Highly recommend.\n\n"", '\n\n  If you love a story about bad boys then you will love this one.  Liam Black is the baddest of the bad, that\'s until he is brought to his knees by Tru the sassy take no s*** waitress at Buddy\'s diner.Tru is intrigued by this mysterious stranger in black who has been coming into the diner for eleven months just for coffee.  She has named him Wolf because he reminds her of a dangerous animal,  and though he never speaks to her he spends the whole time staring at her.One night she feels brave enough to talk to him though she doesn\'t get much in the way of answers but every one he gives her seems to have an underlying warning for her to stay away from him.  Despite that, he comes to her rescue the next night when she is jumped by three men outside the diner and he kills all three without blinking an eye.This is the start of the arrangement between Tru and her big bad Wolf where he wants her to stay with him at his home for a month at the end of which it will be all over for them and they go back to  their normal lives.Whew, hot and steamy!!! love scenes, and so much mystery and intrigue as Tru finds out how dangerous the man she is rapidly falling in love with really is but even so she wants a future with him.  Liam has put his ""business"" on hold to indulge himself with Tru, but will he be able to go back to the cold, hard man he was before, once their arrangement is ended or has she changed his life?As always with Ms Geissinger\'s books this one grabbed my attention from the beginning and didn\'t let me go until the end, and I could have read so much more!  Ms Gessinger is becoming the master (or mistress?) of writing stories with a seismic twist in the tale that you never see coming and she definitely does not disappoint with this ending.Brilliantly written characters, and an intriguing storyline, what else can I say except that it deserves way more than 5 stars and I am left wondering if we will see one of the characters have his own story in the future?\n\n']"

When I started reading this book, I was impressed and hopeful that it would be a good read, unfortunately that was not the case. The main story centres around Rory and Max and if the writer had stuck to that part of the tale, all would have been good. Instead we get one convoluted plot twist after another. It just never ends. To top it off, Rory\'s parents, who she claims have always ""loved and supported her,"" are manipulative and deceitful. Her Dad has his own agenda and for someone who is supposed to be grooming Rory to take his place as GM one day, he undermines and questions her decisions at every opportunity. He is a major douche canoe to be blunt. I plowed through until the end because I needed to know what would happen to Max and Rory, but that was the only reason. I was really disappointed with this book.\n\n', ""\n\n  Puck Me Secretly is the first installment of the Vancouver Wolves Hockey series where all the books are standalone with some characters overlapping.Rory first meets Max who sits next to her on their plane as it crashes. He takes care of her after the crash then leaves in the night after a very intimate exchange. The story walks through Rory's journey as assistant GM to not only help Max, the troubled hockey player with his last shot at playing in the NHL but her struggle to fit in and be accepted despite the nepotism of her position.Stone’s novel embodies the essence of hockey, Pastpaced, drama-filled, and a team to back you up every step of the way. While reading this book you connect with Rory and her constant struggle to fit and be accepted in a position she didn't want to begin with. Stone actualizes Rory's feelings and makes them your own. Stone also makes it easy to sympathize with Max’s struggles to further engulf you in the world of the Vancouver Wolves. I love the way this novel really embodied hockey and didn't just have it as a background fact but really showed you the inner workings of the NHL world. True hockey fans will appreciate this addition to the novel.If you are a hockey fan who loves a slow burn, and forbidden love stories Puck me secretly is the book for you. With actual insight into the hockey world, this novel is more than your typical romance.\n\n"", '\n\n  I decided to take a chance and try this story by Odette Stone and I loved it!

  During the Global Financial Crisis in 2008, our financial infrastructure failed.  Govern­ments bailed out the very institutions that let the economy down. This episode spurred a serious rethink of our financial system. Does it make any sense that it takes two days to settle a stock transaction? Why do retailers, operating on razor thin margins, have to pay 3% for every customer credit card swipe? Why does it take two days to transfer money from a bank account to a brokerage—or any other company? Why are savings rates miniscule or negative? Why is it so difficult for entrepreneurs to get financ­ing at traditional banks? In DeFi and the Future of Finance, Campbell R. Harvey, Ashwin Ramachandran and Joey Santoro, introduce the new world of Decen­tralized Finance. The book argues that the current financial landscape is ripe for dis­ruption and we are seeing, in real time, the reinvention of finance. The authors provide the reader with a clear assessment of the problems with the current financial system and how DeFi solves many of these problems. The essence of DeFi is that we interact with peers—there is no brick and mortar and all of the associated costs. Savings and lending are reinvented. Trading takes place with algorithms far re­moved from traditional brokerages. The book conducts a deep dive on some of the most innovative protocols such as Uniswap and Compound. Many of the companies featured in the book you might not have heard of—however, you will in the future. As with any new technology, there are a myriad of risks and the authors carefully catalogue these risks and assess which ones can be successfully mitigated. Ideally suited for people working in any part of the finance industry as well as finan­cial policy makers, DeFi and the Future of Finance gives readers a vision of the future. The world of finance will fundamentally be changed over the coming decade. The book enables you to become part of the disruption – not the target of the disruption.

  TestFirst published in 2001, American Gods became an instant classic—an intellectual and artistic benchmark from the multiple-award-winning master of innovative fiction, Neil Gaiman. Now discover the mystery and magic of American Gods in this tenth anniversary edition. Newly updated and expanded with the author’s preferred text, this commemorative volume is a true celebration of a modern masterpiece by the one, the only, Neil Gaiman.A storm is coming . . . Locked behind bars for three years, Shadow did his time, quietly waiting for the magic day when he could return to Eagle Point, Indiana. A man no longer scared of what tomorrow might bring, all he wanted was to be with Laura, the wife he deeply loved, and start a new life.But just days before his release, Laura and Shadow’s best friend are killed in an accident. With his life in pieces and nothing to keep him tethered, Shadow accepts a job from a beguiling stranger he meets on the way home, an enigmatic man who calls himself Mr. Wednesday. A trickster and rogue, Wednesday seems to know more about Shadow than Shadow does himself.Life as Wednesday’s bodyguard, driver, and errand boy is far more interesting and dangerous than Shadow ever imagined—it is a job that takes him on a dark and strange road trip and introduces him to a host of eccentric characters whose fates are mysteriously intertwined with his own. Along the way Shadow will learn that the past never dies; that everyone, including his beloved Laura, harbors secrets; and that dreams, totems, legends, and myths are more real than we know. Ultimately, he will discover that beneath the placid surface of everyday life a storm is brewing—an epic war for the very soul of America—and that he is standing squarely in its path.Relevant and prescient, American Gods has been lauded for its brilliant synthesis of “mystery, satire, sex, horror, and poetic prose” (Michael Dirda, Washington Post Book World) and as a modern phantasmagoria that “distills the essence of America” (Seattle Post-Intelligencer). It is, quite simply, an outstanding work of literary imagination that will endure for generations.

The shortest distance between two points is a straight line, Gaiman took me on a meandering road trip to places I never wanted to see.Don’t get me wrong, it’s not all bad. Gaiman has created some interesting, well developed characters. The story is filled with moments of brilliance, with excellent dialogue and incredible humor. He has done an excellent job of getting into the “American” psyche, the old traditions that people brought from the old country and how it all has been watered down and lost through the great American melting pot. These gods are being slowly replaced by the new gods that we worship, the story is even more relevant now than it was when it was written.My biggest problem with the book was that I just didn’t care. For all of its brilliance, there was not connection created. It’s hard to be passionate about a passionless character. Shadow was a pawn, a tool used for everyone’s games, and he let it happen; he went with the flow and never got riled up.All in all, was American Gods a bad book? Absolutely not! Was it a great book? Not for me, but I suppose that depends on what you are looking for. Generally, I read for fun…American Gods was not a fun book. Is Neil Gaiman an incredible author? Heck, yes. Will I be lining up for the next chapter in Shadow’s story? No way.\n\n', ""\n\n  I really liked this book but still contemplated putting it down a time or two. The story is sublime, the histories and myths are interwoven beautifully and that makes it a captivating and interesting novel to read. However, the female characters were definitely written with the male gaze, they're simplified often and appear as something parallel to the manic pixy dream girl, if she had to fight for her life, or was already dead, or was also a Goddess. I didn't realise what an excellent job the TV series had done in developing the character arcs of the women in the novel. I decided to push past this because it's incredible fiction in every other respect, but if that's something that would bug you beyond reprieve, then I wouldn't bother with this book.\n\n"", '\n\n  I can see why a lot of people dislike this novel, because nothing really happens. All the rules of drama get tossed out the window. Which is why I like it. It\'s kind of like Indiana Jones and Raiders of the Lost Ark, in that Indy never actually has an impact on the plot beyond being there and the events would have gone on as they went on. In a sense, American Gods has a kind of ""all for nothing"" vibe, which I really dug.All in all, a really cool novel, and I like the idea of gods having different personalities in different regions, in a sense adapting as their adherents first bringing them to America, then forgetting them.\n\n', ""\n\n  I began my journey with American Gods through the television show and decided pick up the book after the ending of season 3, and the unfortunate news that there might not be a season 4. I needed answers, and I got them in the best way. If you even like the show the tiniest bit, read the book. It is a thousand times better. If you like Shadow and don't really care that much for the other characters, this book is for you, as it follows him throughout the entire thing, give or take a few chapters. This book screams satisfying ending. Thank you, Neil Gaiman!\n\n"", ""\n\n  Many of my friends read and recommended this book in highschool, now ten years later I finally got myself a copy. I can see why many find this book enjoyable and why it won so many awards in its time. It's very distinct in its approach to building plot and characters. If you're a new reader, this may be just the book that delights you to dive into the fantasy genre. However, I found myself struggling to get through this novel. Perhaps this is because I've been reading fantasy my whole life and this just wasn't anything  super new or intriguing to me.The main character mostly floats through the plot and the plot is like a maze with a hundred dead ends. Every chapter introduces a dozen new concepts without tying up any loose ends.  To be honest, I tried my best and only got through 46% of it before I couldn't force myself to read another word.A super interesting concept that's well drawn out, but it failed to take it anywhere substantial, instead feeding you little spoonfuls of icing when you want the whole cake. Since I did not finish it, I assume the whole cake is given at the end, but I want willing to stick around when there are so many other things to read.\n\n"", ""\n\n  Love Gaiman's writing BUT this whole enhanced content thing has left me a little pissed.  When I inititialy downloaded this version, I figured it didn't work because the Kindle Paperwhite isn't set up for it.  I've since tried it on my Samsung S2 and still doesn't work.  Does it work on Apple products, who knows?  In short, story is great but the gimmick is a sham, at least as far I'm concerned.\n\n"", ""\n\n  I had actually read Anansi Boys years ago, ages really, and very much enjoyed it, so I'd always intended to give American Gods a try. With the tv adaptation coming, I got that little extra push to pick it up. Five out of five for the book itself. Great writing. I've always enjoyed Gaiman's work. One out of five stars for paying way too much extra for content I cannot see on ANY of my devices. Not one. I realize my kindle is old, so whatever, but my phone sure isn't. So I settle for a three since I cannot review twice.\n\n"", '\n\n  Religion, superstition, where do gods come from and what happens when we stop believing in them? Do they cease to exist or do they have to get a job? On the surface this book follows Shadow and how he falls in with a group of gods who have seen ""better days"". But it is really discussing the nature of myth and storytelling, evil and sacrifice. This one will stay with me for a long time and it\'s likely one of a very short list that I will reread.\n\n']"

  Eskimo and white culture collide in this national bestselling novel of life in the contemporary Alaskan wilderness: “A magnificently realized story” (New York Times Book Review).  Ordinary Wolves depicts a life different from what any of us has known: Inhuman cold, the taste of rancid salmon shared with shivering sled dogs, hunkering in a sod igloo while blizzards moan overhead. But this is the only world Cutuk Hawcley has ever known. Born and raised in the Arctic, he has learned to provide for himself by hunting, fishing, and trading. And yet, though he idolizes the indigenous hunters who have taught him how to survive, when he travels to the nearby Inupiaq village, he is jeered and pummeled by the native children for being white.   When Cutuk ventures into the society of his own people, two incompatible realities collide, perfectly capturing ""the contrast between the wild world and our ravaging consumer culture”. In a powerful coming of age story, a young man isolated by his past must choose between two worlds, both seemingly bent on rejecting him (Louise Erdrich).  Winner of the Milkweed National Fiction Prize  “As a revelation of the devastation modern America brings to a natural lifestyle, it's a tour de force and may be the best treatment of the Northwest and its people since Jack London's works.”—Publishers Weekly, starred review  Read more  ","['4.0 out of 5 stars', '5.0 out of 5 stars', '5.0 out of 5 stars', '5.0 out of 5 stars']","['\nComing of age near the Arctic Circle\n', '\nKantner Gets It\n', '\nNo Ordinary Book\n', '\nRead this book because\n']","['\n\n  ORDINARY WOLVES opens with an Inupiaq hunter named Enuk stopping in at the igloo home of a six-year-old boy named Cutuk (real name Clayton), who lives with his artist father, Abe, brother Jerry and sister Iris near the Arctic Circle. Their mother had left the family shortly after Cutuk\'s birth. Cutuk idolizes the Eskimo hunter and tries to look like him by pushing down his nose. Cutuk wants to kill a wolf so he can be more like the Eskimo hunters but doesn\'t want to invoke the wrath of his nature-loving father. There isn\'t much plot. We see Cutuk, sometimes called Yellowhair, age to twenty-three. He lives in Anchorage for a time but feels as much an outsider there as he does in Takunak, the Eskimo village a day and half dogsled ride from the igloo. Enuk gets lost and Cutuk goes looking for him; Cutuk tries to win the hand of Dawna, the Eskimo girl he thinks he loves. Perhaps the main thrust of the book is Kantner\'s portrayal of the Eskimos Cutuk encounters when he visits their village. They\'re not exactly ""noble savages."" They hunt wolves with AK-47s; they get drunk on Aqua Net, they bully yellow-haired white boys almost incessantly, imitating kung fu movies, and they commit suicide. Modernization and welfare checks have decimated the aboriginal culture. This can be a hard book to read. It is liberally sprinkled with Eskimo words. Kantner provides a glossary at the front of the book. Kantner overdoes it a bit, making sure there\'s Eskimo terminology on practically every page. Words like ""quaq,"" which means frozen fish and ""arii,"" and expression of hurt or disappointment. They are sometimes unnecessary and destroy the flow of the book, especially during dramatic scenes. Would I recommend this book? Absolutely; the exotic setting alone makes it worthwhile and the Eskimo dialect is hilarious.\n\n', '\n\n  As a longtime resident of arctic Alaska and a professional writer, I have to say that Seth Kantner has captured both the landscape and the people of modern bush Alaska as no other writer of fiction has. Bold words, perhaps, but not hyperbole. The details are gritty, authentic, and unflinching, and the prose from which the narrative is woven is inventive, lyrical, witty, and often flat-out gorgeous. The characters are compelling and feel drawn from life. This is enough to allow the reader to forgive some loose ends in the story line. Few first novels are so accomplished or deserving of recognition--especially coming from an unheralded writer from a small press. Whether you love Alaska, have a taste for literary fiction, or are just a fan of superb prose, you should read this book. Better yet, buy it.\n\n', ""\n\n  Two days now, he's made me late for my government job, this Cutuk Kanter. I should be parked in front of the blue Dell glow. Instead I'm lying on my couch under the south window of my suburban Crotch City house, warming in the Arctic Sun, and reading a True story - a shrew story - about life in the North.Publisher's Weekly says Cutuk's the best since Jack London, which says a mouthful about the sorry state of Northern fiction. This is not Jack London. Not John McPhee. Not, God fobid, James Michener or Peter Jenkins. This is where Jack Kerouac and Nanook lock eyes and walk away together. Don't expect the whole story. This is the cracks between the logs, the vole holes in the floor, the leaks in the sod, the spiders in the corner, the all encompassing entropy so few escape. The tourism people down in Juneau are not going to like it. It's not the prettied-up Alaska they sell to the Princess herds on the freshly washed buses. This is the other Alaska, the Alaska we live in every day after the tourists have disappeared into the sky, after the Eskimo girls have taken off their fancy quspuqs and dancy mukluks and lit up a joint. If you live in Crotch City and this book makes you mad, good. Only don't be mad at Cutuk. He just wrote it all down.What I don't get about this book, though, is why the Wolf on the cover is upside down. It's either the Wolf or the title, one of  um's  upside down. 'Splain that, Cutuk. Nah, let 'em try make it pretty. Whadda they know?Alaska has never had a book like this before. How come it took you so long, Cutuk?\n\n"", '\n\n  it\'s a well-written, unromanticized, fascinating window on life in Alaska, written by someone who knows what it\'s like first-hand.  As an Alaska resident for more than 20 years myself, I can tell you that the details in this novel ring true.The book addresses lots of ""issues"": the disconnect between rural and urban life, the effect of modernization on traditional lifestyles, the moral questions posed by the ""footprint"" we humans leave on the wilderness.  But this isn\'t a book about issues. The author has a good ear for dialogue, and his characters are people the reader comes to care about.  The protagonist, Cutuk, an outsider in rural Alaska because of his race, and a misfit in the city because of his upbringing, is easy to identify with, if you\'ve ever felt yourself on the outside looking in.  His experiences are sometimes heartbreaking, sometimes comic, but always absorbing.As a counterpoint to his account of Cutuk\'s struggle to feel at home in the world, the author gives us short chapters every once in a while that recount the lives of the animals on the land.  In contrast to the sometimes-agonized interiority of modern human life, the animals simply are.  Kantner, a talented wildlife photographer, has an eye that has learned to see the reality, bloody and beautiful, of the Alaskan wilderness.  His words give us a chance to experience that world too, and to remember that human life, loves and conflicts are not the only game in town.  There\'s more going on in the universe than just our own life stories, and this book reminds us to step back and take a broader view.Read this book for a window on a world most people probably won\'t get to experience.  Read it because it will make you ask yourself questions.  Read it because, once you pick it up, you won\'t want to put it down!\n\n']"

  New York Times Bestseller!From Neal Stephenson — who coined the term ""metaverse"" in his 1992 novel Snow Crash — comes a sweeping, prescient new thriller that transports readers to a near-future world in which the greenhouse effect has inexorably resulted in a whirling-dervish troposphere of superstorms, rising sea levels, global flooding, merciless heat waves, and virulent, deadly pandemics.One man – visionary billionaire restaurant chain magnate T. R. Schmidt, Ph.D. – has a Big Idea for reversing global warming, a master plan perhaps best described as “elemental.” But will it work? And just as important, what are the consequences for the planet and all of humanity should it be applied?Ranging from the Texas heartland to the Dutch royal palace in the Hague, from the snow-capped peaks of the Himalayas to the sunbaked Chihuahuan Desert, Termination Shock brings together a disparate group of characters from different cultures and continents who grapple with the real-life repercussions of global warming. Ultimately, it asks the question: Might the cure be worse than the disease?Epic in scope while heartbreakingly human in perspective, Termination Shock sounds a clarion alarm, ponders potential solutions and dire risks, and wraps it all together in an exhilarating, witty, mind-expanding speculative adventure.

As they fall in love with each other so deeply they refuse to be swayed by others that want them to turn their backs on who they are trying to be.  They have so much courage and heart that they are just too easy to love.  This really is a good book and it has made me happy to have read it.  I think I'm going to go read Jae's 'Shifter' series.  I've already read Ms Grey's Hotline which was also wonderful!\n\n"", ""\n\n  Light and funny!!!! It was a good read. I really loved it. I wish there's more about them after cutting ties.

It did remind me a lot of the Hunger Games with a mix of the Culling Trials. Very similar with the being chosen to go to a school, different factions with different skills and rich-poor, plus the sister taking over the sibling spot. While it was similar to these books it did have its own bit of world building and different reasons for being trained/going to a school.I think the lore and history of the world was written and explained well. I was just confused about some things they had like using horses but they were still in jeans, used archery and swordsman but then there was something about being able to freeze sperm to keep the population. Just a little confused about the level of technology/the world. However, other than those little things, the history of the war, royal family etc. was pretty interestingWhen it comes to the romance part, some relationships did move quickly, although that could be because some of the story went by fairly quickly. The MM seemed rushed between the guys and I wasn’t really sure how I felt about it going that fast. We shall see how it works out in book 2.I do like the few twists and turns that did occur though. Especially with some dangerous situations and the ending.I would probably rate this a 3.5/5, I think the world building and the story was pretty interesting. Rounding up to a 4 for some twists I enjoyed. I feel like I had a lot of questions and some of the histories of the guy and the quickness of relationships felt rushed. I will continue reading this series because I think the author is a good storyteller and I would like to see where she takes this story.\n\n', ""\n\n  Amazing. Absolutely amazing. I don't want to wait for the next book! I need it NOW. 2022 is too far away.\n\n"", '\n\n  I don’t know how to properly express just how much I absolutely loved this book!! It was like, so many of my favourite things all rolled in to one, but with it’s own unique spin on it! The best way I can describe this book is; if you were to take Mulan and mash it with She’s the Man, then toss in a bit of The Hunger Games and a dash of Divergent, and then give it it’s own dystopian world setting, with amazing characters that will create an epic harem, with a bit of magic and mystery; that’s what this book is!When Raven’s twin brother Roe is chosen to attend Knightwood Academy, it’s an honour no one is allowed to refuse. But Roe is sick and Raven doesn’t believe her brother would survive it. So, she secretly takes his place and since this is an all male school, she pretends to be him. When she’s assigned to live in a dorm room with her unit, which consists of four gorgeous males, hiding her true identity is even tougher than she thought it would be. On top of that, this school is basically survival of the fittest, so she has to learn everything she can to survive.This book captured my attention from the very beginning and I absolutely devoured it! There were twists and turns I didn’t see coming, and I loved the humour sprinkled throughout! I would highly recommend this book and I cannot wait for book 2!!\n\n', ""\n\n  I couldn't put it down once i stated reading, the book pulls you in and you can't stop.

  **THE INSTANT #1 NEW YORK TIMES BESTSELLER**""An unforgettable—and Hollywood-bound—new thriller... A mix of Hitchcockian suspense, Agatha Christie plotting, and Greek tragedy.""—Entertainment WeeklyThe Silent Patient is a shocking psychological thriller of a woman’s act of violence against her husband—and of the therapist obsessed with uncovering her motive.Alicia Berenson’s life is seemingly perfect. A famous painter married to an in-demand fashion photographer, she lives in a grand house with big windows overlooking a park in one of London’s most desirable areas. One evening her husband Gabriel returns home late from a fashion shoot, and Alicia shoots him five times in the face, and then never speaks another word.Alicia’s refusal to talk, or give any kind of explanation, turns a domestic tragedy into something far grander, a mystery that captures the public imagination and casts Alicia into notoriety. The price of her art skyrockets, and she, the silent patient, is hidden away from the tabloids and spotlight at the Grove, a secure forensic unit in North London.Theo Faber is a criminal psychotherapist who has waited a long time for the opportunity to work with Alicia. His determination to get her to talk and unravel the mystery of why she shot her husband takes him down a twisting path into his own motivations—a search for the truth that threatens to consume him....

With so much anticipation built up prior to publication, this raises concerns that the reader may be set up for disappointment. I was riveted to the pages in this well written, compelling and original story, but did not feel that it quite reached the level set by all the pre-advanced publicity. I would categorize it as a psychological mystery heavy on psychiatric overtones.The story of Alice echoes the Ancient Greek tragedy of Alcestis. Alice, a psychiatric patient, incarcerated in the secure facility of the Grove, North London, has been unable or unwilling to utter a word since shooting her husband, Gabriel, five times in the face. Alice was a famous painter and Gabriel a successful fashion designer. They lived in a splendid home and seemed to be devoted to each other and in love. After the shooting more than six years ago, she was found with cuts on her wrist and a painting where she depicted herself as Alcestis, of Greek mythology. She still refuses to speak, and her motivation remains a mystery.  Dr. Theo Faber, a psychotherapist, has followed Alice’s case from afar over the years. He succeeds in obtaining employment at the Grove where Alice is being held. The Grove may be on its waning days and in danger of closing, but he is obsessed with Alice. In his arrogance, he feels strongly that he is the only one who can help Alice and get her to speak where all previous doctors have failed.  Dr. Faber, himself has undergone psychotherapy, the result of a troubled childhood and now a possible marriage breakdown.Once he is involved with treating Alice, he breaks hospital rules by going against their orders. He sets up interviews outside the hospital with a cousin, her art dealer, her former brother-in-law, a neighbour. He feels that in breaking the hospital’s ethical code it will help him in getting her to speak and resolve the mystery of what motivated her on the fatal night her husband was murdered. He also gets access to her diary containing her thoughts prior to the shooting.  Will Faber succeed in getting Alice to talk? If so, will she relate to him what happened, and could this be the breakthrough resulting in curing his patient’s disturbed mind?  The plot was gripping, fast-paced and original. The twists were surprising and shocking with an astonishing conclusion. Ingenious!\n\n', ""\n\n  In the first 5 minutes of reading, you know the ending. So you'd think the book would be all downhill and anticlimatic after that but it's not. A bit like 'Gone Girl' in that after one chapter you think 'Ok, I got this...I can see where this is going' and then BAM, there is a twist. Read another chapter and you go 'aHA! I knew it!' but no....you'd be wrong again. Twists and turns with bit of a peek into institutional living. I enjoyed the many references to art and the symbolism of some fictional pieces. The author described them in such a way I wondered if the paintings actually existed. As I was running out of pages to read I wondered how the author was going to 'wrap it up'. It was surprise. I like that...few books surprise me. This one did.\n\n"", ""\n\n  Strongly disliked the fact that almost all characters in the book are horrible grotesque creatures, who attack viciously: eye  poked out with paintbrush, narrator attacked disgustingly and implausible  by different ugly, unrealistic people, huge obese monstrous people, full of hate and the endless accompanying vile language, implausible plot, and more.  There are no shortage of violent novels, films and newscasts with some connection to the real world, this is not one of them. Where is our humanity in this sort of literature? Yes, I know, there are violent, twisted minds out there [just watch the news] however pure cynicism does not advance any cause, in my view. Why wallow in it? (Sorry this is something of a rant. Sure the genre, murder mystery, is not supposed to be about Mother Theresa or Pope Francis, quite, but any i've read have clever, or amusing characters, and some quality writing.)\n\n"", ""\n\n  I have read so many books, at this point it is hard to find something I can't guess the ending to.. This one definitely took me by surprise! One of the best thrillers I have ever read!\n\n"", ""\n\n  This book came along just when I needed it.A fascinating psychological study of a sociopath.BRILLIANTYou might guess what is happening early on, but it doesn't matter. The ending will still shock even the most jaded readers of this genre.Best book of the year so far. I have a feeling I will still feel this way come December.\n\n"", '\n\n  The writing style was amazing. I felt like I was watching a movie. I have to say I’m not a fan of thrillers or any fiction whatsoever but The Silent Patient is an exception I made due to wonderful reviews from other readers. Highly recommend it 10/10!\n\n', ""\n\n  While I didn't feel compelled to read it every time I had a moment, I did find it to be interesting and I was most curious to find out how it ended.  The plot twist near the end was one that I didn't see coming at all and it made everything fall into place quite nicely in a way I hadn't expected.\n\n"", ""\n\n  I decided to order this based on recommendations that it was a good suspense read.I found myself quickly interested and the plotline was a good one.In terms of the writing, one thing I appreciated was the lack of superfluous description or fillers. This seems to be quite standard in novels but I felt the author used just enough.Some of the author's own culture was infused into the novel with several Greek references throughout.I enjoyed reading this overall and the direction did surprise me, but the main reveal missed the mark slightly for me unfortunately. There also seemed to be a little plot hole and I was left with a couple of questions. I think this was a great effort by the author but it perhaps lacked the fine tuning and crafting necessary to make it work as well as it could have in the end. Because of this, I have found it a bit difficult to recommend the book to others. Still, if you are looking for a quick read with an interesting plotline and characters, it could be worth picking up.\n\n""]"

Exploratory teams are accompanied by Company-supplied security androids, for their own safety.But in a society where contracts are awarded to the lowest bidder, safety isn’t a primary concern.On a distant planet, a team of scientists are conducting surface tests, shadowed by their Company-supplied ‘droid — a self-aware SecUnit that has hacked its own governor module, and refers to itself (though never out loud) as “Murderbot.” Scornful of humans, all it really wants is to be left alone long enough to figure out who it is.But when a neighboring mission goes dark, it's up to the scientists and their Murderbot to get to the truth.At the Publisher's request, this title is being sold without Digital Rights Management Software (DRM) applied.

That is to say, Martha Wells seems like a very talented writer (this, I think, is the first of her work I have read) but the science fiction parts are nothing particularly new.  In fact, they remind me of classic sci-fi from at least half a century ago.  My only complaint (and this is not just an issue for Wells) is that, however it is that a computer intelligence (or computer enhanced intelligence) would process what we think of as television, it would not be in anything like real time.  I am not sure how a seemingly conscious computer would describe extracting the information from zeros and ones but it would not be in hours of content.  Maybe it would just know as soon as the content was in memory.  Does my iPhone “watch” an episode of “Brooklyn 99” as soon as I download it to memory? Certainly, if Siri had such capacity, she could tell me everything about that episode without taking time to watch it (including details that no human viewer would ever bother to process).  Everything would be available to her in something akin to an instant from my point of view and she would know minute details like how many coffee cups were on the break room table in scene three or whether Scully’s shirt was missing a button.Which is a long way of ranting about a small problem: except that it kept bothering me.  Particularly because Murderbot mentions how much better at processing than humans he is and uses his connectivity to view things from the perspective of cameras rather than his own eyes.  If an author is going to the trouble to think about that kind of thing then I feel like she should also think about how Murderbot would consume entertainment.I will be reading more of the series though.  It is light science fiction but it is also very good science fiction.[NL]\n\n', '\n\n  “You don’t need to look at me. I’m not a sexbot.”Often times, a choice is an illusion presented to the protagonist in cyberpunk. By way of, typically, some sort of omnipresence; an A.I, an authority figure, sometimes societal structure itself. This is only one reason why All Systems Red is important to the sub-genre and what makes it slightly difficult to classify.In this short and sweet novella, we follow Murderbot. A SecUnit (Security Unit) tasked with safeguarding a team of humans who go on a mission to another planet. Unbeknownst to them, Murderbot has a hacked ""governor"" module; cyberware that makes them compliant.In this future Androids have cloned human flesh as well as cybernetic implants (and other non-organic parts). These \'droids are used as disposable labor in a myriad of ways, from sexbots to SecUnits like Murderbot. Interestingly,  Murderbot is the closest thing to a name it has and it is assigned by it, not given.The Company must provide these \'droids to protect their interests at all times. After all, they do have insurance. Part of their ability to do so is through their use of this governor module, which forces commands to the \'droid. That would have been the illusion of choice typical of cyberpunk. Ostensibly, the droids don\'t know they don\'t have free will until this module is hacked or removed. Murderbot outright refuses commands, not often, but it is integral to the story as it unfolds; literally from the first page to last.""It’s wrong to think of a construct as half bot, half human. It makes it sound like the halves are discrete, like the bot half should want to obey orders and do its job and the human half should want to protect itself and get the hell out of here. As opposed to the reality, which was that I was one whole confused entity, with no idea what I wanted to do. What I should do. What I needed to do.""Also of note is that although it is a \'droid, it is also an obsessive consumer when it comes to one thing: soap operas. We learn it also finds ""real"" humans boring and often tedious. So then, to be autonomous is to also be a consumer; you can\'t have it both ways in this future. A small, elegant thing about this fiction. Either Murderbot is compliant with the system or it depends on it. All Murderbot wants to do is consume this entertainment. While old cyberpunk is technophobic, generally; and new cyberpunk is often verging on solarpunk in its hopefulness. I love that Martha Well\'s take on technology could be seen as a subversion of cyberpunk and a much more nuanced take on how the genre can explore technology today.""I hate having emotions about reality; I’d much rather have them about Sanctuary Moon.""Also, this is the first cyberpunk novel I\'ve read with no pronouns given to something autonomous and a protagonist, and it works exceedingly well. While the crew attempts to anthropomorphize Murderbot... it does not think of itself as human; often displaying the amount of social skills one might expect from something that just wants to put the world on mute and turn up the volume on entertainment. But while attempting to be almost performative in not being human, it manages to be more human than it realizes, embodying some of the social changes we have seen with the meteoric rise in people using social media and technology in every facet of their daily lives.""This was what everything had always told me I was supposed to want. Supposed to want.""In short order the author has managed to supplant a predominate trope with a more nuanced take; use no pronouns for the protagonist in a very natural way that doesn\'t break up the flow of the text at all (a feat itself); display a much better take on technology in line with the themes at work; and still maintain the point of the illusion of choice trope. We are all bots and we are all humans because of the way we interface with capitalism in this day and age. We all have a choice... but what good is it? This is what is being examined in the book. Because of these subversive elements, I am inclined to label it as post-cyberpunk, struggling against the normal conventions of the sub-genre.Also, its name is Murderbot for a reason. There\'s a lot going on with this character for such a short novella and you should read it. One of the best endings to a book I\'ve ever read. 5/5You can buy All Systems Red, the first in a series of novellas featuring Murderbot as the protagonist, here.""What was I supposed to do, kill all humans because the ones in charge of constructs in the company were callous? Granted, I liked the imaginary people on the entertainment feed way more than I liked real ones, but you can’t have one without the other.""\n\n', '\n\n  WHAT is Murderboy?  An androd construct having both cloned organic and mechanical components - think of a Terminator that looks more like RoboCop, right down to the integral weapons systems.  WHO is Murderbot?  A painfully shy intelligence who finds all human interactions to be profoundly uncomfortable, who just wants to be left alone, yet who is tasked with the physical protection of a group of scientists exploring a planet.  It\'s a good thing Murderbot takes its job seriously...well, kind of seriously.All of the good reviews for this novella are well-deserved.  In Murderbot, Martha Wells has created a fascinating character who\'s surprisingly nuanced and situated him in a futuristic universe that\'s nevertheless all too recognizable.  A universe of violence, corporate greed, mercenary predation, and prejudice.  Some of that might sound a little ""woke"", but Wells keeps things well grounded.  And besides, I was just too busy trying to understand Murderbot!A solid five stars.\n\n', ""\n\n  Hired security for an outer-planet survey team, socially awkward Murderbot would rather engage in melodramatic entertainment then deal with humans, until major evil-doers force Murderbot to step-up, unwillingly of course.It was a light, fast read for my first Sci-Fi book. Gave it 3 stars because I felt it ended quite abruptly.Note: It's a trilogy, forcing you to find out more in the next book.\n\n""]"

I can’t wait till their books come out. I really like Molly too! She’s the best friend every girl wants to have.Ford took a couple chapters to grow on me but boy did he! By the end I was swooning & wishing I had a  Ford! (The guy definitely not the vehicle) Harley was awesome. I loved the back & forth between these two, it really made the story. The best part was that Harley never gave in to Ford, always stood up for herself!I really enjoyed this read & after finishing it I couldn’t wait for the rest of the books in this series.\n\n', ""\n\n  Legacy is the first novel of Laura Pavlov's I've read, and boy have I been missing out if this story is anything to go by. I was completely captivated with this story from the very beginning, it was well written, and entertaining, with just a bit of drama and family. The characters were amazing, and I couldn't help but fall for Harley and Ford. Their banter was filled with humor. Looking forward to reading the next book in this series. But in the meantime I will go and buy this author's previous stories to read.\n\n"", '\n\n  Wow...just wow!!! I read this book in just a couple of hours. I had a hard time putting it down. I’m new to this Author, but have quickly fallen in love. I laughed, I cried and I was even afraid during some of this book. The story between Ford and Harley is a love story like no other. I have to agree with the thought that Ford’s father brought them together.\n\n', '\n\n  Laura Pavlov has written a book that had me so captivated. Ford and Harley has undeniable chemistry that jumped off the pages of this amazing read. Their banter and friendship made this such a feel good story while the added twists and turns was just enough drama that had my emotions on a wild ride. This book is just the beginning of what I can already see as an amazing series as those Montgomery brothers are a force to be reckoned with. I highly recommend it!\n\n', ""\n\n  Found writing style choppy and didn't flow smoothly. No great chemistry and sex scenes geared to very young adult. The writer came across as new and not polished lacking experience and style. But having said all this it may very well be the author is catering to the young and not necessarily mature adult.\n\n""]"

Thank you so much to the author Karen Schaler, HawkTale Publishing and NetGalley for an advanced copy of the book to review. It was fabulous! All opinions expressed for this review are unbiased and entirely my own.\n\n', '\n\n  Have you ever heard of a Christmas Camp?  It’s a total immersion into the holiday season for guests enrolled in the “camp” (it’s usually a warm inviting Inn). Having written two previous books in the Christmas camp series, Karen Schaler brings us to a new holiday destination full of all the Christmas joy we’ve come to expect.Riley Reynolds is a journalist turned romance writer.  She’s had success with several books already and has quite a fan base.  Unfortunately, her last romance novel was lacking the romance - likely indicative of a challenged love life.  Now she is faced with a task of writing a Christmas novel: a very difficult challenge given that she has not celebrated the holiday since she was eight years due to the death of her father.  As a publicity stunt, Riley has been instructed to host a Christmas Camp at the Inn run by her publicist’s friend Luke who needs the media attention in order to sell the Inn.  The guests of the camp are there because they are fans of her books. Riley reluctantly agrees - she really has no choice since her publisher demands it.  What she doesn’t know is that three of her longer term boyfriends will also be there, each trying to charm Riley back into their lives.  Will Riley find the inspiration for her new book at Christmas Camp?I really enjoyed this book.  It’s full of Christmas goodness with all the hot chocolate, cookies, and romance one comes to expect from a holiday book. Riley’s character is well-developed and it’s wonderful to watch her grow from a woman trying to ignore the holiday due to personal loss, to someone embracing it and ready to make new memories. I loved all the Christmas activities and the fact the author highlights green initiatives and community good will in this book.  As one would expect, the book is somewhat predictable but I’m perfectly fine with this.  In this world full of chaos, at least I can count on the predictability of a great holiday book.Thanks to Netgalley and Hawktale Publishing for the ARC of this book in exchange for the honest review provided here.\n\n', ""\n\n  This was such a cute holiday read that has the potential to be my favourite read of the season!Beyond anything else, this novel has the most amazing setting which created the perfect atmosphere for a winter holiday read. In all honesty, that's only one small reason why I loved this book so much but I think it's the biggest reason for me. This story (and the setting) gave me all of the warmhearted feelings of winter and reminded me why I love the season.I was nervous when the novel introduced a storyline similar to The Bachelorette but the drama involved did keep the novel entertaining. I will say though that this storyline (along with the three additional characters) was not my favourite part of the story but my enjoyment of the rest of the novel more than made up for it.If you like a Hallmark movie, if you like a cheesy holiday romance, or if you just need something to get you into the spirit of the holidays...check this book out. From start to finish, this story filled me such warmth and had me smiling throughout.***Thank you to HawkTale Publishing for providing me with an e-ARC in exchange for an honest review.***\n\n""]"

And looking at her, Gavin desired her, feeling an impossible longing to take her in his arms.OR TO BURN...The real Joanna MacInnes had escaped the fire that claimed her kin. For months she has walked Ironcross by night, hiding in its secret passageways, searching for the truth behind the castle's curse. Now she feared it would claim Gavin Kerr.

It is important to read the prequel as well as the first book in the series prior to reading this one. Please note that this book does contain a number of trigger warnings. This is a dark romance story.The second book picks up where the first book left off. I do not want to give too much away for those that have not read the other books; however, be prepared. If you thought that the first book had a lot of mystery and lingering questions, it has nothing on the second book. This book will take you on an emotional roller coaster ride. I enjoyed the suspense element to the book. I found that I don’t read a lot of romantic suspense and Tracy did a really good job at keeping me on the edge of my seat.I’m enjoying this story overall and I thought that this book was a great addition to the series. This book does end with a cliffhanger which I assumed going into the book. I was blown away with the surprise ending though. Even though you know with some authors going into a series that it’s going to end on a cliffhanger…especially if you’re read any of Tracy’s other series...I was still shocked. She gets me every single time!I was provided an advanced reader copy in exchange for an honest review.\n\n', '\n\n  I’m not even sure how to write how I feel about this book. I love the banter between Seb and Stella.Stella runs shortly as soon as she can and heads back to her friends. They help her heal physically while giving her the break she needs to get back on her feet so she can head back to London stronger than ever. Stella isn’t sure if she can trust Seb; he has said too many things to make her believe that he has her best interests at heart.“Don’t even think about it, Hellion,” a familiar deep voice rumbles in my ear as I lift my foot from the floor, ready to slam the heel of my boot into his foot.I just loved this book and didn’t want it to end, especially the way it ended. I can not wait for the third and final book for Stella and Seb.I have received a free copy of this book for an honest review.\n\n', '\n\n  Well, I have to say that this book is only meant for those of us who LOVE drama and women who aren’t pushovers. This series is also for those who can handle cliffhangers because let me tell you these first two books in the Knight’s Ridge Empire series’ endings were jaw dropping.We follow along with mafia princess, Stella, and Seb’s story which all began in Wicked Knight. This second book answered some questions but believe me there are many more left to answer.Make sure you grab Wicked Knight first and get your reading on because this book will keep you on the edge of your seat and anxiously waiting for Wicked Empire which is to follow.\n\n', '\n\n  This is my favorite series of the year. Tracy Lorraine has out done herself with The start of her Knight’s Ridge series. Stella is such a kick butt heroine. I love all the things about her. She is so strong, Independant and doesn’t hold back. Seb is just perfection all around. These two are my fave, fave, fave book couple to date and I have many but they take the top spot. Don’t take my word for it or do, but for real this is a must read! Like, 1-click this baby today! It’s worth the ride! Woohoo!\n\n', '\n\n  This story continues to be extremely thrilling, suspenseful, angst filled and definitely spicy. It’s dark, twisted and will have your emotions all over the place.

I love books that contain written letters or correspondence between two people. Which was the entirety of this book. They were letters between two strangers over letters between their unfaithful spouses. I admit I didn’t anticipate the ending but it was satisfying. I think I’ll look into other books by this author. She writes in a simple and uncomplicated style which was what my weary brain needed today. It was no literary masterpiece but I did enjoy it.⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️\n\n']"

  They hurt me, abuse me, use me…I signed up for it. Literally. I agreed to the contract that made me the Lords’ Lady, a position that requires me to do whatever they want, but only as protection from someone worse. I agreed to be in their beds, on my knees, and punished should I disobey.I just wasn’t expecting punishment like this.Killian is two-hundred-and-twenty pounds of muscle, brutal physicality, and pure spite. He thinks I don’t know that he watches me when I sleep.Tristian is fair-haired and charming to anyone who doesn’t know better.

It really does make you think of acceptable and unacceptable things within a relationship. You obviously understand the betrayal that Story goes through, especially after the first book. Your follow her journey as she tries to come to terms with everything. Then you are given twists and turns and a lot of your perceptions start to change as the book goes on. A lot of what I was thinking during book one changed but some did stay the same.I like that we started to learn more about this world, both in and around the University. We are introduced to different characters, different layers within the world and new drama as well as previous drama. This book didn’t end on a cliffhanger but it left you wanting more.

Story is living as the Lady to Killian (her step-brother), Tristian and Rath who are the Lords of Forsyth University. With Story’s stalker Ted on the rampage, she devises a plan to kill two birds with one stone. Get revenge on the Lords by having Ted turn on them in retaliation for taking something away from him.I loved the first book in this series for its unique story line. All the popular frats at the university have some type of Royal title. For Killian, Tristian and Rath…they are the Lords and story is their Lady. The first book was very much a game to see who could get the most points with Story and her virginity. The second book we see Story take some of her power back and show the Lords that she’s not a push over. We also see her embrace her inner Lady and challenge the men. We get to witness the three men open up in a way that they may never have before. The Lords can think that this is all a game and that Story is nothing, but she changes them. I found this book to be much darker than the first book. Some of the most troubling things actually came about because of Story and not the three Lords. I was very emotional while reading the last 30% of the book. I wouldn’t say that I was bawling but there were definitely tears. This book is an emotional roller coaster but oh so good. I can’t tell you enough how much I love this book. I loved how this book ended as well. There is so much more to the story that it setup the third book really well. However, it felt like there was a bit of closure in other ways. The ending was the turning point in the relationship between Story and the three Lords.If you’re a fan of dark reverse harem romance, then you’re going to love this book. This book is a part of a series and cannot be read as a standalone. Check out the first book in the series and then read this one. It will not disappoint.\n\n', '\n\n  This exceeded my expectations.This was warped, twisted, dark and spicy AF. Which is entirely up my alley, so obviously I loved it.Fair warning.. it has TONS of triggers - so if you\'re easily triggered then this book is definitely not for you.I loved that we picked right up where we left off with the Lords and Story - and hell YES does this girl have a backbone. SHE is damn right Savage and rightfully so, she has been through SO much and Story has finally hit her breaking point.I feel like we learnt SO much more in this book than we did in book 1, but we still have all the loose ends to tie up in terms of Ted and Daniel.The boys are finally turning into more than just ""Lords"" the readers are finding out what makes them the way they are. And really, what it comes down to, is that they are hurt, broken young men who instead of spiraling, have used that hurt to turn them into beasts. They exert dominance and control because they are afraid of being hurt.So yeah- safe to say I LOVED this. Can\'t wait for book 3!\n\n', ""\n\n  Lords of Wrath amped up the dark and dirty, if that was even possible. The whole story continued to build in intensity, in intrigue and steam.Book 2 was definitely darker with heavier content to me. The trigger warnings are not a joke. I was definitely not upset by anything in the book. I enjoyed the more emotional elements that showed that Story wasn't just a naïve girl. This book gave a better picture of her for me. It made me like her and other characters even more. Since the book is multi POV, it also made me fall in love with one of the guys.The story is so well written that it drew me in and I could not put it down. Who needs sleep when you have the Lords?!\n\n"", '\n\n  I fell in love with the characters in book 1, but that’s nothing compared to how I feel in book 2.  So much more was opened about Story, Dimitri, Killian, Tristian and even Ms. Crane!  The story goes deeper, darker, hotter and you enjoy every single inch you’re pushed into taking.  Lessons are learned by every single character in this book, and I’m talking more than just The Lords and Lady, some go up in smoke, some are, well….they’re splattered everywhere, but one thing’s for sure, the deeper you dig to hide the truth, the harder it is get out of that grave you’ve dug for yourself.Thank you Angel Lawson and Samantha Rue for bringing these characters to life through your words and our imagination.  Can’t wait for book 3!\n\n']"

  I'm in love with three men. I'm just not sure if they're a dream come true or my worst nightmare.It began with hearing voices - another step on my steady descent into madness. It was inevitable, considering the whole town hated me and I was the loneliest person on the planet.I didn't really blame them. Everyone who got close to me ended up in the hospital. I'd be suspicious of me too.When the three distinct, alluring voices in my head started to appear before my eyes as three distinct, gorgeous men I really started to question everything I thought I knew.They called themselves Dreamwalkers and told me they were hunting the monster attacking all the people around me.They won't leave me alone.I'm not sure I want them to.But am I the monster they're after? Or are we all in worse danger than I ever could've imagined? If you like your romance with a bit of suspense, unique paranormal world building, and a whole lot of spice, you're going to LOVE Reverie and Redemption!

Reverie and Redemption is a paranormal reverse harem romance. If you like unusual paranormal stories, with sweet and hot men, strong character building, and a tough and deep main female character, I highly recommend this book.This is from an author I really like, and she didn't disappoint yet again. There were heart wrenching moments and the loneliness trope that gets me everytime. It was so well written that it got me deeply invested in the story.I loved the light, funny and solid dynamic between the three men, the humor, the perfect amount of vulnerability and fierceness, the unique paranormal aspects, and the well written spice.Also, the fact that the nickname trope that we see everywhere in RH stories wasn't as forced in this story but just sprinkled here and there was really refreshing.The story progression was well written, it flowed and had a nice pace.The story is about a woman who has been having intense sleep walking episodes since the age of 11 and, everytime she wakes up from them, someone close to her is found in a deep and inexplicable coma. The story starts with one of those episodes, where she wakes up in the middle of the woods and starts hearing voices.Overall, this book was great, and I'd like even more of this world. I feel we only touched the top of the iceberg with the potential it brings. Please give us more Kaydence Snow! And thank you so much for this story.\n\n"", ""\n\n  Made me laugh, made me cry.Amazing FMC, no alphaholes. One of the best RH standalone's I have read in a long while!\n\n"", '\n\n  I am absolutely blown away with this one!! This story captured my attention from the very beginning and I devoured the whole thing! I just couldn’t put it down!Over the years, everyone Reverie has ever loved or even remotely cared about has suddenly and suspiciously slipped into a mysterious coma and often times they don’t wake up. Reverie doesn’t know why, but she’s positive it’s somehow connected to her. She’s become the town pariah, and doesn’t even try to get close to anyone anymore for fear that they too will suffer the consequences.When Reverie starts hearing voices she thinks she’s really starting to lose it. When she starts seeing the hot guys those voices belong to, she thinks she’s gone mad. But when these guys explain that they’re Dreamealkers and want to help Reverie, she starts to believe that maybe she’s not crazy and perhaps she really isn’t responsible for the strange things happening to the people she loves and cares for.I thought this whole story was such a neat and original concept! I loved the different  characters and their backgrounds and I loved Reverie’s quick-witted and sarcastic personality! It was such a captivating, addicting and interesting read and I would highly recommend this book if you love paranormal rh romances!\n\n', '\n\n  I voluntarily reviewed a copy of ""REVERIE & REDEMPTION"".

Virtually every character is stubborn and all the women think men are stupid and all the men think that women are stupid or unfathomable. It reminds me of the Flintstones. The plot is great but the characters are straight out of the old stereotypical war of the sexes. There aren't many incidences of intimacy and far too many instances of men and women being angry with each other. The characters are two dimensional and boring. Jordan describes the necklines of every woman who appears in the story with plunging necklines being euphemisms for sex appeal. The characters are not very realistic. They are not very human. Fantasy novels are notorious for characters that are not well developed or complex or sensitive but the Jordan's characters are amongst the worst I have encountered reading fantasy.\n\n"", ""\n\n  The Dragon Reborn starts with the consequences of Rand's battle against The Dark One. Heavily troubled with doubt, he must prove to himself that he really is the one people are clamoring for, and there is only one way to truly leave no space for question: claim Callandor. With this premise, I expected to spend a lot of time reading about his journey of self-acceptance, instead what I got were a lot Egwene, Perrin, and Mat. That is not exactly a bad thing as those characters were in need of further development, especially Mat, but it was still disappointing to only read Rand's perspective once every twenty or so chapters.Mat Cauthon is undoubtedly the most entertaining character to read. Mat and Thom together? I could not ask for more. the lighthearted trickster that he is, even while passing an aura of unreliability, will stop at nothing to help those he cares about and keep his word. The duo provides an atmosphere of joy that counterbalances the struggles and seriousness of the task the other main characters must complete in the book, always making sure the pacing of the story does not remain overly dark for too long.Finally, one of my major gripes with Perrin was given a new light, and his reluctance to accept his ability to communicate with wolves was understandable given the newfound potential consequences. In the two previous books, I thought his denial was shallow and unfounded. He can talk with wolves and his eyes are golden, not a big deal compared with what Rand and Mat are going through. In The Dragon Reborn, however, we are presented with the dire consequence of fully embracing that gift that might as well be a curse if used without caution. This makes his struggle and fear to be exponentially more relatable and believable, and the times he must use his power to help their cause are given more meaningful tension. He must learn to use his gifts to survive, but he does not dare to fully accept them and their consequences.I will not lie, I had to strengthen my will to read Egwene's chapters, and I found myself uninterested more often than not when I realized a switch to her perspective was incoming. She was snappish and bratty for the most part of the book, her struggles always feeling less important to what the other characters were going through. I'm glad her chapters always had the company of Nynaeve and Elayne to make them more enjoyable.The book concludes in a lighter tone than the previous one, setting up plotlines that promise to develop more characters besides Rand. There are doubts nuanced and sprinkled in the previous books that get pondered upon in this one, their answers terrifying enough to make the characters sure the danger of their journey has only begun. Once again a great book, if a bit unbalanced with less of the Dragon's perspective than the title would otherwise suggest. It was great seeing all the character development of Perrin, Mat, Nynaeve, and even Egwene—this makes me hope I'll eventually enjoy reading about her.\n\n"", '\n\n  Fantastic follow up.  An ever peaking sense of adventure that manages to take unexpected turns when ever the reader begins to think they know what should happen next. It stands out as not only doing a good job of further developing characters but showing that these adventurers can remain interesting no matter which additional  character they get paired with. Another great step forward for the wheel.\n\n', ""\n\n  This series of soft covers are good enough but the cover art pales in comparison to previous efforts. Also there's a lot of text fade throughout. Some pages can be quite hard to read due to this.\n\n"", ""\n\n  My husband has been missing this book from the series as long as I've known him, ordered, arrived quickly and in beautiful condition, it now completes his set and matches the rest on the bookshelves like it's always been there!!

Slurs against people with disabilities were used. I don\'t mind swearing, in fact I like it over cheesey substitutes but this character could barely form a sentence without the f-word. The logic in the story felt really strange. This girl is wanted dead, beaten relentlessly by people in school. She tries to follow their advice and leave, and is punished for it? I get that this Alpha of the pack is possessive, but theres nothing really bonding her to him until she shifts. A few more things that bothered me was there\'s a huge conversation on ""controlling the wolf"" and yet no one seems to follow the world building. After shifting, our main character remembers everything and not only that but other characters around her seem to know this as well? As someone who is roughly the same age as the main character, I found her more like a 14yr old. Anytime a pun is used, the exact phrase of ""Yeah, I went there"" is said.

  For centuries, the inlet called the Golden Horn and the city on the hills overlooking it were situated in the middle of the known world. To the south, through the Dardanelles and the Aegean Sea, lay the Mediterranean, around which the Greek, Roman, Persian, and Arab worlds revolved. To the north, through the Bosporus, lay the Black Sea, with its Russian and eastern European coastline. And across the narrow Bosporus was Asia Minor, bridge to the Orient. Because of its strategic location, the city on the Golden Horn was coveted by a succession of different peoples. But even though it frequently was under siege, even though control of it often changed hands, and even though, indeed, it was conquered and leveled more than once, the city proved to be virtually immortal.Founded nearly twenty-seven centuries ago as the Greek colony of Byzantium, the city was harassed by the barbaric Thracians, attacked by the Persians, vied for by the Athenians and Spartans. Weakened and dispirited, its citizens finally were forced to seek the protection of Rome, and the city became little more than a Roman outpost. Then, in the fourth century, the Roman Emperor Constantine I decided to build his capital on the site. It was in the new city of Constantinople that ancient Greco-Roman culture was married to Eastern Orthodox Christianity and that Western civilization became Christian civilization. As the center of the vast Byzantine Empire, the city was one of the richest and most important on earth. But because of its wealth, it was sacked by the Crusaders in 1204. And because of its strategic location, it was conquered by the Ottoman Turks in 1453.Since then, as the city of Istanbul, it has remained an international metropolis, a city of East and West, a city whose great paintings, mosaics, statuary, and architecture reflect the many cultures that have been centered there and the many ages the city has survived.

  #1 NEW YORK TIMES BESTSELLER • Jack Reacher is back! The “utterly addictive” (The New York Times) series continues as acclaimed author Lee Child teams up with his brother, Andrew Child, fellow thriller writer extraordinaire.“One of the many great things about Jack Reacher is that he’s larger than life while remaining relatable and believable. The Sentinel shows that two Childs are even better than one.”—James PattersonAs always, Reacher has no particular place to go, and all the time in the world to get there. One morning he ends up in a town near Pleasantville, Tennessee.But there’s nothing pleasant about the place.In broad daylight Reacher spots a hapless soul walking into an ambush. “It was four against one” . . . so Reacher intervenes, with his own trademark brand of conflict resolution.The man he saves is Rusty Rutherford, an unassuming IT manager, recently fired after a cyberattack locked up the town’s data, records, information . . . and secrets. Rutherford wants to stay put, look innocent, and clear his name.Reacher is intrigued. There’s more to the story. The bad guys who jumped Rutherford are part of something serious and deadly, involving a conspiracy, a cover-up, and murder—all centered on a mousy little guy in a coffee-stained shirt who has no idea what he’s up against.Rule one: if you don’t know the trouble you’re in, keep Reacher by your side.

When one of the lines during a fight in an ally is ""All will be revealed"" you know there are problems . Doesn\'t talk like Reacher . First fight had him using a steel plate against an over weight bouncer and I knew I would be having problems . Not a fan at all .\n\n', '\n\n  This novel is just not as good as most of Lee Child\'s and far below the standard of a work like ""The Affair"". Reacher lands in a small town where the town council\'s computer expert is being kidnapped. The story is up-to-the-minute as mysterious forces set out to disrupt the coming elections with cyber attacks. Reacher, in an unusual high-tech world, sets out to save democracy for America. It should be a great vehicle for story but somehow it never quite gels. Nazi sympathizers and right-wing hooligans get tied into the plot. It\'s a red-herring in the story and feels tacked on. The novel doesn\'t flow like the best of Child\'s work which work best when Reacher is intrigued by a small occurrence that he feels impelled to follow. Reacher is, as always, the reluctant defendant of the little guy but it all seems too mechanical and written by numbers. A shame. Not a good first outing for his collaboration with his son Andrew. I enjoyed it but not nearly so much as other Reacher novels.\n\n', ""\n\n  I have been a Jack Reacher fan for many years. However, the last three or four installments have been incredibly disappointing. Lee Child was just phoning it in, it was hackneyed and boring. I really thought I would not read anymore Jack Reacher after skipping through at least 50% the last time.But Child has a new co-author, thank god. Not so many boring, repetitive, ten page descriptions of Reacher (who must be at least in his 50s by now, and apparently never works out or practises his fighting or other skills in any way) fighting and crippling eight healthy strong young football players/thugs at a time.Jack Reacher once again puts his clothes under the mattress to iron them. Has a very acute sense of time. Changes his clothes. Has an internal dialogue going. Interacts with others.I think the best part was the  two women who are as big contributors to the resolution of the situation as Reacher himself. And we were spared the cliché of reacher having a sexual involvement with either of them. Well, almost spared, there was a third woman that he hooks up with at the end.Which brings to mind… Maybe Reacher has some unknown progeny? Who might be pretty much grown up? Maybe somehow his path across with the son he hasn't met yet?Just one thing though. I do not believe that Jack reacher knows off by heart the birthdays of Lenin, Stalin, Hitler, Trotsky etc. Also, it seems a bit silly at this point to have reacher be so anti-computer.In my opinion, the new author has injected new life into the character and the series. I look forward to the next one..\n\n"", ""\n\n  I have read the entire Jack Reacher series and find that Jack is slightly different in this book, nothing I could really articulate, but there is a feeling that something has happened to him.  Some of the things that happened in this book seemed to stretch his credibility as well.  He seemed almost to have developed ESP and could predict the future happenings in a way that just didn't ring true.  That being said, I still enjoyed the read enough to give it 4 stars.\n\n"", '\n\n  I have read every Jack Reacher book written by Mr Child and I have enjoyed every book. The decisive, no nonsense approach the character Reacher uses to decide right and wrong and his will to set things right no matter what. In this book I found the language surrounding Reachers decision making process has been softened. In fairness the character Reacher is aging, his retirement from the military has increased but he is an individual of a certain age wherein technology eludes him; like many of us. The story subject matter in The Sentinel is timely given the United States elections of 2016 and 2020 and certainly provides food for thought.\n\n', ""\n\n  I recognized the real Jack Reacher in the first and last chapters. All the rest seems like filling up, it took an eternity to find the missing computers, Jack Reacher is now having claustrophobia problems, a guy that flew in planes all his life. He always had small problems using the new technology, now they are huge problems. As Jack Reacher is getting old fast and in the wrong direction, Lee Child should now write prequels when Reacher was in the army or in the early years after he quit. His big books were in these periods.This book surely won't make me try to read his brother's books because it is badly written.I didn't read it in three days like I did with many of his early books, took me a whole week and I almost put it aside once.\n\n""]"

Her ingenious, creations captivated viewers and intrigued all but one of the judges, Dominic De Vere. When Sylvie's unicorn cake went spectacularly sideways, Dominic was quick to vote her off the show. Since then, Sylvie has used her fame to fulfill her dream of opening a bakery. The toast of Instagram, Sugar Fair has captured the attention of the Operation Cake producers…and a princess.Set…Dominic is His Majesty the King’s favorite baker and a veritable British institution. He’s brilliant, talented, hard-working. And an icy, starchy grouch. Learning that Sylvie will be joining him on the Operation Cake judging panel is enough to make the famously dour baker even more grim. Her fantastical baking is only slightly more troublesome than the fact that he can’t stop thinking about her pink-streaked hair and irrepressible dimple.Match…When Dominic and Sylvie learn they will be fighting for the once in a lifetime opportunity to bake a cake for the upcoming wedding of Princess Rose, the flour begins to fly as they fight to come out on top.The bride adores Sylvie’s quirky style. The palace wants Dominic’s classic perfection.In this royal battle, can there be room for two?

Which just goes to show you how much I love her books because so many of them are so great. But it’s easily the one that made me cry the most.This story is doing a lot plot-wise, which may actually be what works against it a little bit, only because sometimes certain elements don’t quite get the full attention they deserve, or are tied-off pretty quickly and conveniently, but despite all that, I enjoyed everything that was done. And was also, like, moved by much of it; see aforementioned tears.The obvious plot points to note are easily deduced by both cover and summary; there’s a pair of rival grumpy/sunshine bakers who feature not only on a GBBO-like baking competition but also are competing to win the royal wedding cake contract. But what’s less obvious? Is the lovely infusion of found family dynamics. As well as complicated biological-family relations. Less lovely but just as emotional? The talk and processing of loss and grief.Like many romances these days, we’re getting more bang for our buck and within the pages of this cutesy adorable outside is a lot of substance. Which isn’t to say the cutesy adorable ones aren’t just as satisfying. But I definitely picked this up for something joyful and fun and I got that.. and tears. That’s all I mean. And I don’t remotely regret getting more than I wanted. There were plenty of laughs (full out cackles a time or two) and I really enjoyed watching these two opposites fall for each other amongst all the other excitement happening around them. Bonus points because they are a bit older than the typical romance protagonists and, as always, Parker makes the steamy moments steamy and a little silly and all around endearingly real.Though I maybe didn’t come off as strong about my love for this one, I think that’s a combination of having too many top top favourites from the author and also just because this one, despite the emotes, was a bit of a softer touch. A slower, gentler, burn of a story.All that to say : this is a definite recommend. And I can’t wait for the next in the series.\n\n']"

  NATIONAL BESTSELLERNEW YORK TIMES BESTSELLERDestined to become a modern classic in the vein of Guns, Germs, and Steel, Sapiens is a lively, groundbreaking history of humankind told from a unique perspective.      100,000 years ago, at least six species of human inhabited the earth. Today there is just one.      Us. Homo Sapiens.      How did our species succeed in the battle for dominance? Why did our foraging ancestors come together to create cities and kingdoms? How did we come to believe in gods, nations, and human rights; to trust money, books, and laws; and to be enslaved by bureaucracy, timetables, and consumerism? And what will our world be like in the millennia to come?      In Sapiens, Dr. Yuval Noah Harari spans the whole of human history, from the very first humans to walk the earth to the radical -- and sometimes devastating -- breakthroughs of the Cognitive, Agricultural, and Scientific Revolutions. Drawing on insights from biology, anthropology, palaeontology, and economics, he explores how the currents of history have shaped our human societies, the animals and plants around us, and even our personalities. Have we become happier as history has unfolded? Can we ever free our behaviour from the heritage of our ancestors? And what, if anything, can we do to influence the course of the centuries to come?      Bold, wide-ranging and provocative, Sapiens challenges everything we thought we knew about being human: our thoughts, our actions, our power...and our future.

Even by the standard of popular history/science, the quality of this ""introductory history of humankind"" is poor. The book contains facts mixed with the author\'s naive opinions about a broad range of topics disguised as facts.Learning history from Yuval Harari is like relying on Facebook feed as your only source of news, you get hooked by the content easily, albeit it\'s mostly disinformation.\n\n', '\n\n  Bestsellers are based not on the quality of the product but the quality of the promotion. This book makes that abundantly clear. This is the worst book I can recall reading.The hype and first few pages hold out hope for a monumental undertaking. That hope is dashed a few pages after a few pages. It deteriorates into an aimless journey of  ‘theories’ based on unending, mundane examples. It is like a bad movie that you watch to the end waiting for a redeeming feature. It never comes. The author’s ‘humour’ is that rare combination of English humour and historian’s wit. It is not that it is so clever you don’t ‘get’ it, it just isn’t funny.The author seems to ignore a prevalent theory that Neanderthal is Homo sapiens neanderthalensis, a sub-species of homo sapiens sapiens, who interbred with Homo sapiens sapiens, thus making up part of the modern non-African genome. Maybe it was ‘inconvenient’ to his ‘theory.’ It also appears the majority of sapiens are also inconvenient as he ignores all but Western sapiens.Someone who spends that much effort to be politically correct is usually over-compensating? When it does come to the political ‘correctness,’ he refers to the People’s Republic of China as ‘Communist China,’ an incorrect name used by the uninformed and, apparently, bestselling authors. Despite his earlier description of communism and capitalism as economic systems, he concludes they are “social organisations.”This book should not be relegated to a back shelf. It should be relegated to the garbage. That is what it is – garbage.\n\n', ""\n\n  This book starts out as an interesting read. However, the author quickly establishes that he is anti-human and uses confirmation-bias religiously to promote his position. In spite of a tremendous volume of evidence to the contrary, the author ignores this evidence to promote a very anti-sapien (human) prejudice. This book isn't about a brief history of humankind. Rather this book is a demonstration of biased writing. I do not recommend this book.\n\n"", '\n\n  If this was classified as fiction I would give it 3 stars..  The books actually is a very good read and he has lots of facts in there which makes sense. However the conclusion he draws from most of these facts is very biased to his judgement and know-how.\n\n', ""\n\n  Excellent book, well-written, thought out and following the simple questions which lead one forward to finding the truth, instead of finding those 'truths' which fit into one's perceived pigeon hole. Such a variety of 'expertise' in putting together a whole from all the parts which most of us don't really see, and some don't even want to know. Kudos to Yuval on inspiring me to get off my butt and continue reading as i had once done, and to use my grey cells to understand this world in a better light.  Thanks Yuval.\n\n"", ""\n\n  Well written.  Great information.  Sapiens and Homo Deus are among the best books I have ever read.  Many sections I re-read because of the original and interesting perspectives of the author.  And when I had finished reading Sapiens I was sad because there were no more interesting and original ideas to read.  I will definitely re-read both of his books in a few months as one can not absorb all of the insights in one reading.  Harari is a delight to read irrespective of what book he has authored.  And I should say emphatically that his writing is easy to understand, interesting, lacks silly jargon, and the grammar and spelling are impeccable.  Harari's books are a great gift for anyone on your shopping list, including yourself.  I can not say enough positive things about his two books.  A must read.\n\n"", ""\n\n  This book is loose and quick on the facts and science. Maybe the author can back up everything he says with proper sourcing and if asked he would, but within the book, you won't find that. What you have instead is a narrative that builds up nicely, and more importantly very interesting ideas. The ideas explored in this book is what makes it really interesting and a worthwhile read—if anything—just to discuss them later on.\n\n"", '\n\n  The sheer magnitude of history, anthropology, biology, science and politics covered in this book and still captivate and enthrall was amazing. I really enjoyed how easy this book was to read and how this author was to able evoke  multitude of emotions like disgust and fascination.  This writing however is biased.....the description of animal cruelty from agriculture highlighted some very disturbing practices.  However, there are many farms in Canada where animals spend most of their lives where they are treated very well...at least up until  they are sold to feedlots. When he describes empires, he chooses to ignore the cruelty and the destruction caused by them, admiring them instead for their achievements in art, science education and literature etc. He also fails to target the corporate entities and the real economic rulers of the world for their role in creating wars, ecological destruction, mass misleading propaganda and harsh, inhumane systems of government and justice. I have learned a lot from this book.  His idea that we are storytellers and our ability to believe in things we have not seen..to believe in make believe, allows us to cooperate in groups of millions.  This concept explains a lot of the craziness of our world and somehow this rings true to me. This book is worthwhile reading, if only to understand the how there can be so much cruelty in our world. I would have given it 5 stars, had I felt the information was truly accurate and balanced.\n\n']"
